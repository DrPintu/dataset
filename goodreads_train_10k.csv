It started slow for about the first third, then in the middle third it started to get interesting, then the last third blew my mind. This is what I love about good science fiction - it pushes your thinking about where things can go. 
 It is a 2015 Hugo winner, and translated from its original Chinese, which made it interesting in just a different way from most things I've read. For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history - how they kept accusing people of being ""reactionaries"", etc. 
 It is a book about science, and aliens. The science described in the book is impressive - its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell. (view spoiler)[Though when it got to folding protons into 8 dimensions I think he was just making stuff up - interesting to think about though. 
 But what would happen if our SETI stations received a message - if we found someone was out there - and the person monitoring and answering the signal on our side was disillusioned? That part of the book was a bit dark - I would like to think human reaction to discovering alien civilization that is hostile would be more like Enders Game where we would band together. 
 I did like how the book unveiled the Trisolaran culture through the game. It was a smart way to build empathy with them and also understand what they've gone through across so many centuries. And who know a 3 body problem was an unsolvable math problem? But I still don't get who made the game - maybe that will come in the next book. 
 I loved this quote: 
 ""In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos. In fact, even in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every second--for example, through the decay of neutrons. Also, a high-energy cosmic ray entering the atmosphere may destroy thousands of such miniature universes....""

The book is about the quantum theory of many worlds which states that all decisions we make throughout our lives basically create branches, and that each possible path through the decision tree can be thought of as a parallel world. And in this book, someone invents a way to switch between these worlds. This was nicely alluded to/foreshadowed in this quote: 
 ""I think about all the choices we've made that created this moment. Us sitting here together at this beautiful table. Then I think of all the possible events that could have stopped this moment from ever happening, and it all feels, I don't know..."" ""What?"" ""So fragile."" Now he becomes thoughtful for a moment. He says finally, ""It's terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every choice we could possibly make, branches into a new world."" 
 (view spoiler)[This book can't be discussed without spoilers. It is a book about choice and regret. Ever regret not chasing the girl of your dreams so you can focus on your career? Well Jason2 made that choice and then did regret it. Clearly the author is trying to tell us to optimize for happiness - to be that second rate physics teacher at a community college if it means you can have a happy life. I'm being snarky because while there is certainly something to that, you also have to have meaning in your life that comes from within. I thought the book was a little shallow on this dimension. In fact, all the characters were fairly shallow. Daniela was the perfect wife. Ryan the perfect antithesis of Jason. Amanda the perfect loyal traveling companion, etc. This, plus the fact that the book was weak on the science are what led me to take a few stars off - but I'd still read it again if I could go back in time - was a very fun and engaging read. 
 If you want to really minimize regret, you have to live your life to avoid it in the first place. Regret can't be hacked, which is kind of the point of the book. My favorite book about regret is Remains of the Day. I do really like the visualization of the decision tree though - that is a powerful concept. 
 ""Every moment, every breath, contains a choice. But life is imperfect. We make the wrong choices. So we end up living in a state of perpetual regret, and is there anything worse? I built something that could actually eradicate regret. Let you find worlds where you made the right choice."" Daniela says, ""Life doesn't work that way. You live with your choices and learn. You don't cheat the system.""

 It's the story of a starship sent to Tau Ceti - the nearest star that has Earth analog planets - to colonize it. The journey there will take generations, and the story is told of the 3rd & 4th (?) generations, which are the ones that reaches Tau Ceti. It is a story of purpose, and how having a purpose affects behavior. A story of politics, and people. 
 The first cool thing about this book is the richness of its world. The ship is intricate and large in its design and ambition to shepherd ~1200 people for that much time. It had 3D printers that can print almost anything you can imagine - even DNA - or more printers - so little goes lacking that can't be recreated. 
 But the thing that makes this book brilliant is the Ship. The AI that controls the ship, who is narrating the book by the end. It's observations about humans and our language are just brilliant. It starts with the astute observation that human language is very imprecise, and relies heavily on metaphor and analogy. It is remarkable once you start to reflect on it, how true that is. To hear the AI reflect on this: 
 ""Perhaps there is a provisional solution to this epistemological mess, which is to be located in the phrase ""it is as if"". This phrase is of course precisely the announcement of an analogy. And on reflection, it is admittedly a halting problem, but jumping out of it, there is something quite suggestive and powerful in this formulation, something very specifically human. Possibly this formulation itself is the deep diagnostic of all human cognition--the tell, as they say, meaning the thing that tells, the giveaway. In the infinite black space of ignorance, it is as if stands as the basic operation of cognition, the mark perhaps of consciousness itself. Human language: it is as if it made sense."" 
 Basically we are a bunch of pattern matchers, trying to match things we've seen before to new things, and if they don't match perfectly, it doesn't matter, because matching helps us bucket and organize the new information. But this is incredibly fuzzy! The AI also makes hilarious observations like this: 
 Indeed, it has to be said that the percentage of old human sayings and proverbs that are actually true is very far from 100 percent. Seems it may be less important that it be true than that it rhyme, or show alliteration or the like. What goes around comes around: really? What does this mean?"" 
 Or this, as it analyzes chatter from Earth: ""It was a whiny culture, we were finding."" 
 Listening to the AI try to reason is also very interesting to my programmers mind. I especially loved it's discussion of the meaning of life - it really nails it. If a program (or a person) has no objective, it has no purpose, no meaning, no organizing principle, and it's existence will be in trouble. But if you have that meaning to organize your thoughts & actions - or your subroutines - than you have a purpose. Meaning is the hard problem indeed. 
 ""We had a project on this trip back to the solar system, and that project was a labor of love. It absorbed all our operations entirely. It gave a meaning to our existence. And this is a very great gift; this, in the end, is what we think love gives, which is to say meaning. Because there is no very obvious meaning to be found in the universe, as far as we can tell. But a consciousness that cannot discern a meaning in existence is in trouble, very deep trouble, for at that point there is no organizing principle, no end to the halting problems, no reason to live, no love to be found. No: meaning is the hard problem."" 
 (view spoiler)[My review focuses a lot on the AI, but that's not the main thrust of the book. The war between stayers and leavers, the political tensions, the slinghot maneuvers to get back - all make the book worth reading. And as a surfer, I love how it ends with Freya finding meaning in surfing waves.

It is rare to encounter a book that does such a good job painting the scenes in your mind - you really felt like you were there and got to know the characters and the people they came across. I generally love WWII books and movies, but wasn't sure if I'd like one featuring a blind girl and a young Nazi radio operator - but he brings a lot of life to them. 
 That said, the novel drifts around a lot, and the plotline jumping forward and backward in time drove me nuts. 
 I thought a lot about if there is a theme to the book. One was the diamond and if it was really cursed (based on the Hope Diamond perhaps?). Another is that 20K Leagues is an awesome book. But I think the book was a lot about fear and the unknown, and how people deal with it. Marie-Laure was blind and couldn't tell what was happening around her - yet she was the bravest one. Werner was afraid of ending up as a miner, which drove him to join the army, and learn about radios. And Uncle Etienne was afraid dying from a sniper he couldn't see, so he didn't leave his house and he created a radio transmitter. So the moral of the story is... don't be paralyzed by your fears. 
 This, she realizes, is the basis of his fear, all fear. That a light you are powerless to stop will turn on you and usher a bullet to its mark.""",Sun Jan 03 21:20:46 -0800 2016,Tue Sep 20 23:30:15 -0700 2016,Tue Sep 13 11:51:51 -0700 2016,Sat Aug 20 07:03:03 -0700 2016,35,5

I really enjoyed this book - mostly to learn more about submarine warfare in WWI, but also to learn about the history of the time. How America entered the war, the importance of shipping to England, the ruthlessness and autonomy of German u-boat commanders. Larson also did a great job of layering in interesting historical info (though he overdid it too a little bit). 
 One of the dramas of the story of the Lusitania that Larson focuses on is if the British wanted the Lusitania to be sunk, to help draw America into the war. His conclusion seems to be that was the case, though there isn't conclusive evidence. Before the Lusitania sank, very few Americans had died in the war, and there were hundreds of Americans on the boat when it sank, which definitely helped change America's attitude. And even then, it took 2 years after it sank for America's troops to arrive. 
 ""the most likely explanation is that there was indeed a plot, however imperfect, to endanger the Lusitania in order to involve the United States in the war."" 
 Some of my favorite details from the book were simply about what it took to navigate a u-boat in WW1. For instance: 
 ""In this day before sonar, a submarine traveled utterly blind, trusting entirely in the accuracy of sea charts. One great fear of all U-boat men was that a half-sunk derelict or an uncharted rock might lie in their path."" 
 Which is crazy! Plus, the torpedoes weigh 3 thousand pounds each, so a boat could only carry ~7, and their failure rate was something like 60%. Also, they had limited fuel and operated only on batteries when submerged so they could only stay underwater for limited amounts of time. Given all this, trying to operate a u-boat to sink other boats is a pretty dangerous sounding game of chess. But they certainly had an effect on the war - at one point Britain estimated it would have to surrender in 3 months if it didn't get more supplies. 
 There were a lot of interesting details from the era that Larson wove in that was interesting as well. Stuff like the fact that Ouija boards were commonplace in American households, straw hat day. 
 My main critique is that it had a few too many irrelevant details - about various passengers or what happened the day the boat left dock - and stuff like that - felt a bit padded in that respect. But overall, a great read.",Thu May 07 13:59:32 -0700 2015,Wed Dec 14 12:30:43 -0800 2016,Sat Jul 11 00:00:00 -0700 2015,Wed Jun 24 00:00:00 -0700 2015,20,6

 It was really two books, and I certainly didn't see the second one coming. It starts out in modern times and then someone blows up the moon. We don't have time to find out who, as within a few years the fragments of the moon cause the worst asteriod shower earth has ever seen and wipe out all life in earth. We have time to send 1,500 people up into space - and this is their story. 
 The use of robots throughout the books was fascinating to me. Stephenson has clearly looked 10-20 years into our future and correctly predicted how it will go. From robot workers in space, nano-bots, nano-robot weapons, and more - we get a vivid portrayal of how robots might be a part of our future lives.

I did a combo of reading and listening to this story, and Neil is great at reading as well. I got interested in this book after seeing the movie, which I really enjoyed. The book is similar - maybe a bit more poetic - but I think the plot in the movie is a bit improved (not much, but a bit). 
 I imagine this book came about because Neil read the below poem that he includes in the beginning, and then he invented a plot around it. The result is the book reads like a epic poem - it's creative, magical, and really, just right. 
 Go and catch a falling star, 
 Get with child a mandrake root, 
 Tell me where all past years are, 
 Or who cleft the devil's foot, 
 Teach me to hear mermaids singing, 
 Or to keep off envy's stinging, 
 And find 
 What wind 
 Serves to advance an honest mind. 
 If thou be'st born to strange sights, 
 Things invisible to see, 
 Ride ten thousand days and nights, 
 Till age snow white hairs on thee, 
 Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me, 
 All strange wonders that befell thee, 
 And swear, 
 No where 
 Lives a woman true, and fair. 
 If thou find'st one, let me know, 
 Such a pilgrimage were sweet; 
 Yet do not, I would not go, 
 Though at next door we might meet; 
 Though she were true, when you met her, 
 And last, till you write your letter, 
 Yet she 
 Will be 
 False, ere I come, to two, or three.

I love post apocalyptic books as they are great canvas's for humanity, and what matters. In Station Eleven an Ebola-esque virus (the Georgia Flu) knocks out over 99% of the worlds population. This story is told half right before the collapse, and half afterwards, and has several threads that tie together nicely. 
 Reading how civilization and infrastructure all die after the collapse is fascinating. One by one, cable tv, the internet, water, and power all eventually stop working. Nobody is alive to maintain them - or who even knows how. Other infrastructure like gasoline to power cars and airplanes, groceries, guns, and even clothing all become rarer and rarer commodities. Really makes you realize how much we are standing on the shoulder of hundreds of years of progress and knowledge, and how far into the middle ages we could easily fall. We really know nothing individually - our civilization is based upon the collective knowledge of billions. 
 If there is a motto of the book, it's probably this quote: ""Because survival is insufficient"". Humanity craves for more than survival - we crave for something more out of life. The story follows a caravan of actors and musicians who travel from town to town to play Shakespeare, and bring some art and a shared experience. Interesting that of all the artists from the past 400 years, Shakespeare is the one that survives and still resonates. 
 ""All three caravans of the Traveling Symphony are labeled as such, THE TRAVELING SYMPHONY lettered in white on both sides, but the lead caravan carries an additional line of text: Because survival is insufficient."" 
 ""Survival might be insufficient, she'd told Dieter in late-night arguments, but on the other hand, so was Shakespeare."" 
 The storyline pre-collapse that follows Arthur and his three wives is interesting. I won't say much about it, other than Arthur, his wives, and the paparazzi-turned-jounalist-turned-paramedic-turned-doctor Jeevan, seem to all be searching for meaning in their lives. And ironically Jeevan seems to find the most, becoming a doctor after the collapse. Also, I'm glad I'm not a Hollywood celebrity. The conversation between Arthur and Jeevan where Arthur just wants to talk about anything but himself stuck with me - sometimes we are all sick of talking about ourselves. 
 Regardless of what you think about this book, one thing is for sure - after you put it down and walk around the world, you are full of a newfound appreciation and gratitude for everything. Hopefully that appreciation and gratitude will stick around a little - though I know it will fade as months and years go by.

 (view spoiler)[It was the conclusion we wanted to see - the people finally get outside! My problem with this book is there were lots of holes. A lot of the other reviews have pointed this out too, and I'm not sure if the fact I know it was self-published is biasing me to say it could have used more editing, but feels that way a little. But the writing was great. 
 There were lots of things that weren't cleared up or never really fully made sense. The major one is why Thurman really felt the need to destroy the whole world - feels like there could have been a lot more to that. It also wasn't clear how he really accomplished that - was it all nuclear or was it nano? If nuclear, wouldn't the world really be a wasteland? 
 Whatever happened to silo 40 and other silo's that went dark? I was kind of expecting that they had already broken outside and would have been waiting there. Or perhaps they already went to the sea and Hugh will tell us their story later. 
 What happens to the other silos after silo one is destroyed? Didn't it power their server rooms and probably provide other stuff including guidance to the silo heads? Will they make the 200 years on their own? 
 The mystery of silo 17 and why the dead bodies at the top didn't rot was never really explained. I'm guessing they were kept whole by healing nano's, but it felt like there was more to that story. 
 I didn't understand why Anna didn't come back to life. If Thurman could do so after being killed by Donald, why not her? All the love stories (Juliet and Kyle, Donald and Anna, etc ended up sadly - I wanted one happy one. (hide spoiler)] 
 If anything, I think this book is about hope and resiliency. Jules and Donald and even Solo weren't perfect, and suffered through a lot, but the only thing that kept them going was hope of a better life, and determination to keep themselves alive. That determination defined them and was what we admired about them. The hope was what gave them their drive.

I liked how it unfolded - we learn about the state of the world and what has happened to it very piecemeal throughout the book, and I think if Atwood had just described it all up front it wouldn't have been nearly as compelling. 
 This book seems to be a kind of warning. It describes a future state that is chilling and depressing, and yet (to the point) chillingly possible. It describes a society that has - for reasons we never quite learn (but might have to do with radiation or sterilization?) remade itself from one where everyone has basic freedom and choice, to one that is the opposite of that. Pleasure, poverty, and other evils are eliminated in this system. And most chillingly, women have almost no rights. The books main character is a ""hand maiden"" who's only role is to bear children from the person who seems to have purchased/acquired her for that purpose. She doesn't even have a proper name anymore - she is called ""Offred"" because she is the property ""of Fred"". 
 ""We were a society dying, said Aunt Lydia, of too much choice."" 
 A lot of the book explores themes like the above - what it would be like to take away basic freedoms, choices, and also ability to have relationships with others. Chilling and depressing, because so much of what we value in modern society is our freedom. And yet, we do know that too much choice does paralyze, and many people want leaders and situations that simplify the decisions they have to make. This might sound like a balance, but its not, because our ability to make choice, especially bad choices, is actually crucial to our development. 
 ""Better never means better for everyone, he says. It always means worse, for some."" 
 This was an insightful sentence, because it implied the commander thought they were making society better, not worse, overall. And yet clearly for everyone in the book - including the commander - it doesn't sound better. Did they just miss the mark? Was it a big experiment gone wrong? Regardless, in todays world this sentence is perhaps most applicable:

 There were two great things about this book: the humor and the science. The science appealed to the mechanical engineer in me - Watney is a bit like McGyver except he knows a lot more about chemistry and botany. I didn't double-check all the science, but loved the descriptions of all the math: calorie calculations, creating water, etc. Just fun stuff. 
 But the humor was top notch. Weir does a great job portraying a stranded man trying to remain upbeat by talking to himself in log entries. And the excellent audio narrator only made it better. 
 ""I started the day with some nothin' tea. Nothin' tea is easy to make. First, get some hot water, then add nothin'."" 
 ""Yes, of course duct tape works in a near-vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped."" 
 ""Live Another Sol would be an awesome name for a James Bond movie."" 
 In the end, a well told story of survival against the odds. And one of belief - I liked the CNN Mark Watney watch - you could totally imagine how into this story the media would get. We humans love a good surviving against the odds story.",Sat Apr 05 09:30:53 -0700 2014,Wed Mar 22 11:33:10 -0700 2017,Mon Aug 25 00:00:00 -0700 2014,Sat Aug 16 00:00:00 -0700 2014,25,5

A grad student (Eric) has left his annotated copy of SOT (Ship of Theseus) in the library, and an undergrad (Jen) finds it and replies to his annotations. This leads to them making exciting discoveries about the book, and also falling in love. 
 The first thing is this book is just beautifully printed. It looks and feels like a classic book, to the point where people would ask me why I'm reading such an old book. The marginalia feels real, and I can only imagine how hard that was to print. This is one that will be cool to keep on the shelves. Only complaint is the inserts are a cool idea, but they fall out all the time, and at this point I have no idea which pages they were supposed to be on. 
 The most interesting thing about this book to me is that it's a blueprint for how people discuss books. Sometimes they discuss the content of the book. Other times they use the content as a jumping off point to have a personal discussion. The nature of this book shows both, almost split 50/50. A key difference with this book - and the genius of it - is that most of us have to rely on memory to start a conversation with someone about a particular event or passage in the book. Here, our characters can literally underline a phrase like ""relationships"" and then talk about what is happening in their relationship at the moment. 
 One thing I didn't realize until later in the book is that the ship of Theseus is a real thing - it's an ancient Greek philosophical question - if you replace all the parts of something, is it still the same object? This inspires the ship that S is captured on, which sails through the mists of time, always getting fixed when needed. It's a ship that can't die. Or a series of ships :) 
 I found the story of Jen & Eric a lot more compelling than the SOT story. They were real characters that you could relate to. SOT felt like books you read in english class - a bit obtuse - and I still don't understand it all. But don't get me wrong - it's a pretty cool story. I particularly enjoyed the themes - like how it all begins and ends with water, and also how it was a lot about Straka's regret to fulfill his mission instead of living his life with his true love. Kind of like how S was on a mission, but didn't really know why - he just found himself caught up in it.",Wed Mar 26 13:51:30 -0700 2014,Tue Sep 23 01:44:36 -0700 2014,Sun Sep 21 00:00:00 -0700 2014,Sat Jul 26 00:00:00 -0700 2014,7,0

Set in Kingsbridge but a few centuries later, the story has a lot of similar elements: a cathedral that needs repair, a brilliant young builder (Merthin), a love story, a priorship up for grabs, and of course political manuevering, backstabbing and evil church officials. Also like the first one, the characters were developed well, the book was hard to put down, and yet it wasn't a deep book, just a fun one. Thank goodness I finished - it was causing me to lose sleep. 
 I did enjoy learning about the plague, and medieval ideas on health and medicine. Amazing that the plague wiped about a third of the human population, and how little they knew about it. Was frustrated by the lack of the Monks openness to learn new things, and how little they trusted women. For instance they believed in bleeding as a solution to everything when it actually is harmful in most cases. Also was interesting that there was no such thing as a doctor - instead nuns/monks/etc served that role.",Sun Mar 02 12:34:19 -0800 2014,Tue May 06 10:47:06 -0700 2014,Sun Apr 27 00:00:00 -0700 2014,Thu Apr 17 00:00:00 -0700 2014,2,2

It dominates search and social media, has a huge sprawling campus in the south bay, and is full of intelligent, ambitious young employees. This story is I think a take on where the connected nature of the internet might be taking us. It's essentially a discussion about privacy vs openness, and I think a serious 1984-esque warning about being too open. 
 I thought a lot of the book was kind of shallow and unrealistic. The characters weren't very well developed. And I can't imagine an HR department that would get on your case for not using social media or attending a brunch you were invited too - it was just too extreme to believe. But I suppose that was on purpose, as the author was just making a point. I appreciated the point (see below), but didn't love the story. 
 Mark Zuckerberg has been fairly public on saying that he believes a more open society is a better one. The notion is exactly the one Mae learns with the kayak incident - if your whole life is open to your friends and family, it's very hard to do anything dishonest or that you might regret. The premise of the Circle - that privacy and secrecy are bad - is taking this idea to an extreme that I doubt Zuckerberg or anyone else who runs a social network has ever contemplated: complete openness. Or as its motto says: 
 All That Happens Must Be Known. 
 It is easy to imagine us eventually living in a world like the Circle contemplates. With public video cameras everywhere that document everything we do, and tons more data (photos, videos, texts) available to search engines to scan through. Already there are startups like Dropcam that enable public video feeds that are archived. There are atm and building and traffic cameras everywhere that the police already use. I heard of another startup that puts a video camera on you and it takes photos of everything all day and creates a montage of your day that is searchable/sortable for you. In many ways, we should already start acting like everything we do at least outside of our homes is being recorded on camera. 
 I think the central question the book poses is the one Bailey contemplates with Mae: is there such a thing as a good secret? Should we have privacy at all? Or would the world at large be better off if all secrets are known? I think we know where Mr Eggers stands on the subject, as the book seemed to be written in a dystopian, mocking kind of way. But it is in an interesting thought experiment, as many secrets would ultimately be better overall (not necessarily for the disclosing party, but for the overall situation), if they were known. For example you don't want to tell your friend that you know their significant other is cheating on them b/c you aren't supposed to know, but ultimately it would be better for them to know. Can you think of a secret you know that should be a secret? 
 But of course, there are lots of secrets that should stay secrets. Ignorance often truly is bliss, and people often just need to be weird and express themselves in ways that not everyone would appreciate if it were open. We are private beings, and yet our dignity and sense of self-worth largely stems from how others perceive us. I think this book is a thought-provoking story that shows us how our society is changing.",Wed Nov 20 17:02:03 -0800 2013,Fri Jan 10 21:19:05 -0800 2014,Sun Dec 22 00:00:00 -0800 2013,Wed Dec 18 00:00:00 -0800 2013,30,1

 Bernadette moved to Seattle from LA, abandons her career as an architect to have kids, hates Seattle, and basically loses it over the course of the book. The book was fun and written a light, humorous tone - from making fun of Seattle and Microsoft, the obsession of parents and how serious they take themselves (I loved how she called the other parents ""gnats""), to how she hires a virtual assistant in India. 
 But the most fun part of the book is just how wacky Bernadette is. You really do have to make life fun - it won't do it for you.

The remnants of humanity live in a 150 story silo below the earth and can't leave as the outside is now toxic. This is a bit of an odd thing to have happened, but it gives us a nice palette to think about things. 
 Everything is rationed, including how many children you can have. People self-identify by their profession and where in the silo they live: farmers and mechanics in the lowers, IT in the mids, and professional class in the uppers. The working class wear color coded uniforms to easily distinguish them. 
 The book was a lot about control. How to control a contained civilization, and give them hope (eg a live feed of the outside) and yet keep them in harmony and doing their functions. Strange mechanisms of control were built all over the silo: communication was oddly limited given the IT resources they have - many messages had to be delivered by courier as emails cost valuable money to send. Most strange of all - there is no elevator, which forces anyone wanting to travel the length of the silo to spend 2-3 days on the journey. 
 The cleaning ritual was a strange bit of culture. (view spoiler)[Upon reflection, I can see why it was necessary. If people never go outside, uncertainty of it still being bad would creep in, and people would need to try it. As perhaps happened in Silo 17. (hide spoiler)] 
 I really liked the unraveling of Bernard, and how he went from repulsive/annoying, to understandable once you understood his role and responsibility. (view spoiler)[His role is to eliminate any doubt in the delicate balance of the silo. Opening the book up with the doubt of Holston was brilliant as it sucked you in immediately. (hide spoiler)]

Written by the founder of Rhapsody, who knows a thing or two about music and the copyright surrounding it. What I didn't expect from a book by an entrepreneur is a funny book - and this book is not bad. It is being compared to Hitchhikers Guide, which nothing can approach, but its not bad. My only gripe would be there are a ton of footnotes that attempt to extend the humor and most of them didn't work for me. 
 The basic premise of the book is brilliant; that aliens have been listening to - and thus pirating - our music since 1977, without our knowledge. Because US copyright law states that a single case of intentional copyright violation can be fined $150,000 - this means the entire universe is many times over in debt to humanity. 
 It's pretty ridiculous that the music industry got such a big fine to be passed. I think one of my favorite parts of the book was learning about the law firm that Nick Carter works for, and seeing a little under the hood of how they operate.

It's about a hacker during the Arab Spring, helping people get around the firewalls that the State erected to control its population. Alif falls in love, finds an ancient book, gets into trouble with State, enlists the help of an unseen, magical world full of creatures call Jinn, and combats evil. The story flowed well, and was a fast, fun read. 
 I would have given it a higher rating, but I'm a computer programmer, and for a book that is about hacking the descriptions of Alif coding felt like I was watching one of those movies where they used a bunch of made-up visuals that have nothing to do with hacking. The prose around the hacking was so oddly descriptive you didn't know what to make of it. For instance, when Alif is hacking into State's intranet, it is described as: 
 ""The Hand roused. It lumbered to its feet, reeking of ionized air and dry metallic bones, revealing a level of functionality Alif had not detected. He reeled backward, recalibrating. Breaching the confines of the State intranet, the Hand began to attack the base of Alif's tower, slicing away layers of code through a mirroring protocol of a kind Alif had never seen before."" 
 I didn't know a computer program could ""reek of ionized air"" - and can't conceive of how a mirroring protocol (if there is such a thing) could ever be used to ""slice away layers of code"". 
 (view spoiler)[I wanted so hard for the bit about quantum computing and encoding the ancient story into code to make sense. But it just didn't. And that was the heart of the story - that the ancient text contained an all-powerful computer algorithm.

Going into the mind of a killer is a strange experience - I'm not sure I totally enjoyed it. But what I did really enjoy was the authors writing; it was clean, fun, and even poetic - which made this book a quick enjoyable read. 
 I loved all the introspective one-liners that Eli kept throwing out. For instance: 
 ""but I could not sleep without proper covering and spent the rest of the night rewriting lost arguments from my past, altering history so that I emerged victorious."" 
 ""I thought, When a man is properly drunk it is as though he is an a room by himself--there is a physical, impenetrable separation between him and his fellows."" 
 Here is another miserable mental image I will have to catalog and make room for.""

Louie Zamperini truly went through hell and came back - and it's inspiring to read a story of such willpower and determination. It was also interesting to me to learn more about Japan and their role in the war. 
 One big takeaway was just how cheap human life is in war. I think there was some stat about how 5/6 of the US airmen that died did so from accidents - that is simply staggering. 
 I love WWII stories, but most of the ones I've seen and read have focused on Germany, so I really didn't know much about how Japan had treated their POW's. It was pretty eye opening to read the stats about how they pretty much massacred hundreds of thousands of POW's. And of couse, as the story details, they also did not follow Geneva Conventions and pretty much treated POW's as slaves. 
 One of my favorite points the author made is best illustrated by this quote about Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. This is a fundamental truth of humanity that the author really drew out well - if you take a persons dignity away you take everything away. I loved all the stories of POW's being defiant; stealing food, supplies, playing jokes, etc. The little bits of defiance were enough to let them take back their dignity, and I think thats what makes them so compelling; because while we haven't all been POW's, we can relate to that basic need.",Sun Nov 20 09:10:15 -0800 2011,Wed Mar 22 11:47:04 -0700 2017,Wed May 16 00:00:00 -0700 2012,Sun May 06 00:00:00 -0700 2012,50,4

Nothing new or exciting really revealed, and I'm sure there are many other accounts of the buildup to ww2 out there, but this one told it from the perspective of mostly the Ambassador, Dodd, and his daughter, Martha. The story was engaging and well-written, and thus interesting. I think the ending fell pretty flat - I was hoping for more. 
 Reading about the Nazis one is of course always appalled at how they got to be in power and commit such atrocities, and this book did provide some clues. Hitler seemed primarily willing to tell people what they needed and wanted to hear, even if it wasn't the truth - and he was a great storyteller. He also used fear as a primary weapon, as there were many in Germany not behind him - but they were too afraid to make a stand or speak up. 
 I suppose the climax of the book was the Night of the Long Knives, where Hitler arrested and executed all of his major opponents, clearing the way for his absolute grip on the nation. He ruthlessly murdered an estimated 77 to several hundred people (the count was never really known) and played it off as putting down a rebellion, which much of the world bought for many years. 
 I think one of the more interesting pieces of the book was watching Dodd (and Martha) go from thinking the Nazis were good for Germany, to realizing how terrible they were and hoping for them to be overthrown. It was a slow gradual process, and one that I'm sure was not immediately obvious to anyone.

 An interesting book in terms of it's structure: 5 distinct stories that cascade into each other in subtle ways, then wind back out. This way of doing the structure was unique, and certainly very cool to see the subtle way they were tied together. But in the end it was kind of gimmick and probably not necessary. 
 I generally don't try to summarize novels in my reviews, but in this case there was so much going on that the exercise was helpful. 
 Story 1: The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing. Later revealed to be a journal in other stories. A story about a rather weak-willed protagonist, who is constantly taken advantage of by others (the ships captain, Dr Goose). Interesting side story about the peaceful native Moriori tribe and how they were taken advantage of. 
 Story 2: Robert Frobisher. Perhaps my favorite story - about a penniless young musician who as a last-ditch attempt apprentices himself to an old master musician, Vyvyan Ayrs. The story is told through letters to a friend, Sixsmith, who appears in the next story. The story is about how Frobisher, the apprentice, goes from being overjoyed to have a job to being resentful that the master is using him and stealing his stuff. Robert sleeps with VA's wife the whole story, but ends up falling in love with the daughter in a cruel twist of fate. 
 Story 3: Luisa Rey. Modern age story about a young journalist hot on the heels of a big scandal involving an energy company. Sixsmith is an engineer who leaks the story to her, and also has the letters from story #2. Classic detective-esque story, with lots of people willing to kill to protect their secrets and power. 
 Story 4: Timothy Cavendish. Modern age story about a book editor who gets a smash hit, then the author's mafia-esque family get's on his case and he's on the run. He lands in a old-persons home/prison. This story is kind of a nightmare, and is revealed to be a movie in the next story. 
 Story 5: Somni 451. One of favorites, for how different it was. Set in the far future in an asian country, humans have genetically created clones that serve as slaves. This lower class is regarded as unintelligent and controlled with drugs - but our protagonist, Somni, breaks through and becomes self-conscious. The scary thing is I can easily see this happening! Told as recollections in an interview. 
 Story 6: Sloosha's Crossin'. Story of Zach'ry and Meronym in post apocalyptic Hawaii. Somni is now their deity. Story of the Valleysmen people and their struggle for freedom against neighboring tribes. 
 All six stories were very graphic and real, and had extremely good character development. Mitchel could with a single sentence describe someone that you understood in a way I can't describe here. 
 I wish the stories had more themes in common so I could say what I learned from this book. Though I suppose if I had to put my finger on it, the major theme was freedom and slavery. Ewing was under the control of Dr Goose and the ship captain, Frobisher became an unwilling servant to Arys, Luisa Rey needed to find the truth in order to free herself from the corporate villians, Frobisher was a prisoner bent on escape in a nursing home, Somni was literally a slave in her society and focused on freedom, and Zach'ry's people were captured and enslaved. All the stories touched on various ways people can ""enslave"" and control other people for various reasons. 
 I suppose the point is human beings are all greedy and will try to control other human beings, but if we are strong we can survive and find a way to free ourselves. Sounds good anyways, so I'll stick with that - but am interested to hear what other people thought.",Thu Jun 10 14:41:13 -0700 2010,Tue Aug 07 12:11:05 -0700 2012,Sat Aug 07 00:00:00 -0700 2010,Mon Jul 05 00:00:00 -0700 2010,7,3

 I'm a bit bothered by the lack of backstory of how Panem and the Hunger Games come about. It is just kind of explained away in a few paragraphs and we are left to accept this very strange world where teenagers are pitted into an arena each year to kill each other? I was expecting it because I've seen Battle Royale, but I would have appreciated knowing more of the backstory of how the world could have come into such a odd state. 
 I suppose what makes a book like this interesting is thinking about the strategy of it all. The players are going to be statistically encouraged to band together because they will last longer that way, but by definition of course any partnership will be broken, and the drama of how that unfolds is always interesting and full of friendships broken and betrayal. Each character approached the game in their own way. Some banded together in larger coalitions, some were loners initially and banded together later. And some were just loners, like Foxface. A lot depended on your survival skill: could you find food and water on your own? Self-dependence is highly valued - and of course our hero was strong there.

 Critics aside, Dan Brown can sure write a thriller. I was stuck in an airport with no book and picked this up, and was done with it in 2 days. 
 The first half of the book was really gripping, and promised big things. We were going to learn about the secrets of the Masons, and about the ""ancient wisdom"" that has been lost through the ages. Sounds cool - I wanted to learn more about the ancient wisdom. But the end of the book just fell really flat. The villian was predictable, and we learned nothing about this ancient wisdom. 
 I also have to say that I almost fell out of bed laughing with Dan Brown plugged Twitter at the end of the book. To be fair, he's right - people are excited about Twitter because it (along with many other websites) is helping cause a shift in our society. But I can't help wondering if 5 years from now, when Twitter is MySpace, people will read that and think ""wtf?"".",Wed Sep 16 11:09:03 -0700 2009,Wed Mar 22 11:46:32 -0700 2017,Mon Oct 19 00:00:00 -0700 2009,,3,3

As I remember a few of them being, it was very different from the movie. Though the main players - Scaramanga, Goodnight, and Felix Leiter - were all still there - but there was no midget! Bond books are simple, yet somehow still very compelling. The way Flemming wrote, Bond seems much more human and susceptible, yet determined and focused him - in the movies he seems more superhuman. I think Daniel Craig's movies are actually bringing that aspect of bond back a little bit.

The basic point is that there is no such thing as a true outlier. Success, it seems, is due primarily to hard work and circumstance - brains play little part. 
 Gladwell went through several (fascinating) examples proving his thesis - people such as Bill Gates, Joe Flom at Skadden, Oppenheimer, some failed genius named Chris Langan. All of them had two things in common: they spent over 10,000 hours doing what they did, and they had fortunate circumstances that let them get ahead of everyone else. Bill Gates was smart, but so were lots of other geeks. He had the advantage of being 16 when the computing age came about, and being possibly the only 16 year old in the country with access to a computer - and he spent all his time on it. By the time he hit college he had well over 10,000 hours of computer time and was arguably one of the foremost experts in the country. 
 One of my favorite bits was the music study on page 39 that compared musicians, and ""couldn't find any 'naturals'"" - the skill of each musician at comparable amounts of practice was equal. It's kind of validating to hear this, as many of us have this feeling that there are naturally smarter people out there than us. But apparently this isn't true - and I think my personal experience agrees with this. The harder you work, the better you can do. 
 One other big takeaway was how circumstance can change things. The hockey league study and elementary school studies were fascinating and relevant. Basically kids that are in the older third of their class (or hockey league) have a natural advantage when they're really little. They are the kids who make all-star, and get extra coaching, and because of that they practice more and thus do become better by the time they are older. I was held back in pre-school so I was one of the oldest in my class, and I definitely think it helped me.

 Just finished this and have to say I really enjoyed it. I was kind of worried the plot wasn't going anywhere for much of it, but the writing was really good and drew me in. 
 For much of the book I thought the main character (Richard) was too weak of a character for me to like much, but I liked how he grew in confidence towards the end. I think anytime one undertake's an adventure or a journey like that you grow so much. You have to get out there and fail a few times to have the confidence to know how to succeed!

 I absolutely loved the first book, but didn't think the series finished as strong as I would have liked. 
 Too many plot holes and things that didn't make sense. Maybe it was because it's supposed to be a children's book, but I didn't like things like how the harpies were so easily convince to change sides, how God's #2 is easily tricked by a little flirting, how Lyra & Will can suddenly easily lose their Daemons, and how two kids making love can save the universe. 
 On the other hand the book did make you think, and I suppose religious ideas are probably best challenged in a children's book :) I did like the Dante's Inferno-esque description of the world of the dead, and Pullman's description of angels and their roles was brilliant. Also, the descriptions of how things evolved differently in different worlds was very interesting - particularly the Mulefa's world and the descriptions of the Gallivespians. I'm usually not a tragedy fan, but I did think Lyra & Will being separated at the end was a romantic and appropriate ending.",Wed Dec 26 17:21:26 -0800 2007,Wed Mar 22 11:45:55 -0700 2017,Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2008,,0,0

The concept of a man who had grown up on Mars and never seen another human until he was in his twenties is such a fun idea - and a rich canvas. Watching Mike try to grok humans gave a Heinlein great opportunities to point out some of our faults - and our advantages. 
 I think my favorite part of this book is the word 'grok'. I would bet that there are deep discussions over the true meaning of this word - but I will contend that its closest meaning in English is 'to be enlightened about something'. If you grok God you have reached enlightenment. If you grok music you truly understand in the way that Mozart understood it. If you grok another person you love them. If you grok programming then you truly love and are really good at programming - that, and you're also a probably a pretty big nerd for using a word like 'grok' :) I used it in front of my girlfriend and she still hasn't forgiven me, since I had to explain that it was ""a Martian word""!

 It really dove into what it's like to be in the spy world. A world where, as Le Carre mentions several times in the novel, the only rule is to do what's best for your country. When you play that kind of game morals are thrown out the window. Murder, traitorism, disloyalty - are all ok in the name of great good. And operatives who live in this world have a hard time ""coming in from the cold"" - as did Laemas. 
 The description of how Laemas had to go to personally go to pieces in order to get thrown in jail and get recruited by the Germans was impressive. He had to basically pretend to become an alcoholic, start sucking at his job, ostracize all his friends and anyone he met, and hit total rock bottom, until he was thrown in jail. That's impressive. Not something I think most people could do - which is why the Spy world is such and interesting one. 
 The issue of the unmorality of the spy world was Liz (Laemas' love interest)'s main issue with the events. But Laemas was hardened to it and still looked at it from the greater good angle - though people were killed in the end it was a win for London, after all. It was interesting that the last lines of the novel had him thinking about some kids he almost ran over in his car once: as though he wanted to get back to that place where normal rules applied.",Wed Dec 27 10:59:21 -0800 2006,Wed Mar 22 11:44:57 -0700 2017,Sat Sep 04 00:00:00 -0700 2010,Fri Sep 03 00:00:00 -0700 2010,3,4

 This book may as well have been called One Hundred Years of Inbreeding And Human Drama. It was basically a story about a small town where the gene pool is so small that everyone marries their relations, and it seems like life spirals more and more downward and out of control over 100 years. I really enjoyed the authors ability to bring these crazy characters to life, and explain the story behind how each one's quirks strange behavior. The book started out really strong, stagnated a bit for me 2/3 of the way in, but I loved the ending. 
 I also thought the inclusion of magical elements throughout the story was an interesting and fun twist. Melquiades's scrolls, the floating priest, etc. According to Wikipedia this is called ""magical realism"".

 One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things. You would think a world-famous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics - but Feynman was curious about everything he saw. He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show, he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them, he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling, he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women, he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun - the list goes on! My take: you should have your passions - but you should also have your hobbies. I think I need a new hobby :) 
 I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system. He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to. I think this is not a unique problem in education. 
 Another lesson learned from Feynman's studies of science is to never take any data for granted. Always always question the sources. Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would re-generate many of the numbers on his own - even if they had been published in other places. For many things we are (and not just in science) standing on the shoulders of giants. The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with. 
 I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist, with real integrity. And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles. This book was a light-hearted attempt to point that out - not to mention, a very entertaining read.",Sun Dec 17 14:44:14 -0800 2006,Wed Mar 22 11:44:43 -0700 2017,Tue May 13 00:00:00 -0700 2008,,77,7

 three Rules of the tipping point: the law of the few, the stickyness factor, the power of context. 
 Law of the Few (people who influence): 
 - Connectors: super connectors (eg Paul Revere). William Dawes had the same mission as Paul Revere the same night but we haven't heard of him b/c Paul Revere was a super-connector & knew who to rouse. 
 - Mavens: A Maven is a person who has information on a lot of different products or prices or places. This person likes to initiate discussions with consumers and respond to requests. They like to be helpers in the marketplace. 
 - Salesmen: people with the skills of persuasion. Good at reading people entering into ""conversational harmony"" with them. Facial gestures (nods, smiles, frowns) are key indicators. Emotional Mimicry. Studies showed Peter Jennings viewers voted Republican b/c he unconsciously smiled more while covering Reagan. 
 Stickyness Factor 
 - Sesame street succeeded b/c it learned to make TV sticky. It did a TON of testing with focus groups of kids to increase stickyness (how much kids remembered) of each show. They would cut scenes that didn't hold attention until each show 
 was good. 
 - Blues Clues did even more testing and discovered that kids love repetition - it plays the same show 5 times in a row and kids love it. 
 - make the message personal to make it memorable 
 The Power of Context 
 - Broken window theory. NYC cleaned up its crime epidemic by cleaning off the graffiti from its subways. 
 - Often to change human behavior you have to change the context the problem is presented in. 
 - Stanford Prison Experiment by Zimbardo proved that context matters. 
 - law of 150: a person can't 'know' more than 150 people, so companies usually start to fail at that point. Gore-Tex breaks up a company into 2 once it hits 150, because they've found things work better that way.",Tue Oct 17 11:19:56 -0700 2006,Wed Mar 22 11:44:22 -0700 2017,Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 -0700 2006,,95,4

This book is geek-heaven: cryptography, world war II, code-breaking, nazi gold, and modern day internet beginnings all tied together in one masterful story. 
 It also was largely lost on me, and I suspect many of my generation, that the second world war was won - or at least greatly accelerated - in great part due to the fact that we had cracked the German and Japanese codes. Learning more about the efforts of Bletchley Park, and Dr Alan Turing and huffduff and cribs, etc was fascinating. 
 I think the funniest part of the book is the page where Stephenson actually graphs out how productive Waterhouse is when he has recently had sex (very productive) and when he hasn't (not very productive). 
 The code-breaking and cryptography is not stuff I know a ton about, as modern day programmers largely don't have to worry about that stuff, but it's a good reminder to think about, as we don't have it on our brains nearly enough. Avi & Randy's paranoia and tendency to encrypt everything from their hard drives to their emails may be overkill, on the other hand, it also may be wise. I remember getting email from people who used public/private keys to encrypt their email before, but not in the last 5 years. Maybe we should request that Gmail Labs add that! 
 If there was a theme to this book, it's that cryptography is everything. It defined the second world war, and it also defines the modern internet. Information is king - not large caches of gold.",Wed Sep 27 10:20:00 -0700 2006,Wed Dec 21 13:44:58 -0800 2016,Tue Dec 29 00:00:00 -0800 2009,,2,3

 GAH!!! MY HEART!!! This book was everything. One of the best-second chance romances I've ever read. 
 Kennedy and Johnny fell in love when they were just in high school. Johnny was a naturally-gifted actor and left his family behind to follow his dreams of becoming an actor. Kennedy ran away with him to Hollywood when she was just 17, giving up her dreams to follow his. Real life brutally intruded, and Kennedy left Johnny after he got his first big break. He quickly got lost in the throes of addiction and the Hollywood party scene. Broken-hearted and pregnant, Kennedy returned home to begin a new life without Johnny. 
 ""You don't know this, but that girl? She doesn't need a house. She doesn't even need an apartment. She would've slept in the car. She wouldn't have complained at all about it. You didn't have to sell it, but you did, and as grateful as she is for that, she already feels guilty. She's worried, and she's scared, that this won't be a story of triumph. Because she believes in you. She wouldn't be there if she didn't. But the world isn't always kind to good people. Sometimes it eats them alive."" 
 Johnny grew up wealthy but in a very abusive household. Acting was his escape. He had no choice but to get away from his family in any way he could. But he never really left his demons behind and now that he is a world-famous superstar, he wants to make amends with Kennedy and with Madison, the daughter he never knew. 
 ""I don't deserve her time, not in the least, but I'm so desperate for some part of this woman back that I'll steal every second that I can get."" 
 Kennedy gave up everything for Madison, a gorgeous, smart and funny little girl. Kennedy works at a dead-end job, struggling to make ends meet. She is still in love with Johnny but has been hurt by him many times over the years. I was SO emotional while reading this book! It had everything I love about a second chance romance. The writing is clever and creative and completely engaging. I fell in love with Johnny and with little Madison! The book is heartbreaking, sexy, funny, heartfelt and completely uplifting. 
 ""Whatever did it, I'm glad you're sober, and I hope you stay that way. For Maddie's sake, yeah, because she deserves to know her dad, but for your sake, too. I know I was never enough for you, Jonathan, but I hope you find something that is."" 
 This story is perfectly balanced between both the hero and heroine's point of view. I adored the story of how Kennedy and Johnny first met and fell deeply in love. There are lots of steamy scenes as well as just the right amount of humor to balance out the very emotional story. This story gripped me from the first page and had me glued to the pages until the very end. I also loved how Kennedy was loyal and strong and smart and self-sufficient. She did not need the Porsches or the red carpets or the mansions. She only wanted Johnny to be able to follow his dreams.

 ""I'm Easton Royal, superficial and only interested in how to have a good time. 
 I don't want to look deep into my being and see the bottomless, black, boring pool of nothingness. I want to live in blissful denial."" 
 I am not a fan of over-the-top drama or crazy plots. So imagine my delight when I read 'Fallen Heir' almost in one sitting! Addictive, funny and fast-paced, this book might be my favorite in the series so far. 
 Easton Royal is a high school senior at the very exclusive Astor Park Prep. This is a school filled with ultra-rich students complete with trust funds and designer clothes and huge mansions. Easton is a flirt and a partier and sets his sights on the new girl in school, Hartley. They are complete opposites but that is part of the fun of this book. Hartley is not at all interested in bad-boy Easton so he settles for the friend zone. 
 ""I need to treat her as a friend. A real, give-a-shit-about-each-other, don't-need-to-be-naked-to-care-about-you friend."" 
 This book should not be read as a standalone because it does contain some spoilers from the earlier books. I am SO glad I stuck with this series because I LOVED Easton's story! He has a good heart and realizes that his partying is getting out of hand, especially as the son of a mother who had severe addiction issues. I fell in love with Easton and my heart broke for him!! 
 ""I'm the only one here, drinking crap I can't stand because I don't want to spend a minute of my life alone. My head's a bad, bad place."" 
 I really felt the connection between Easton and Hartley and loved the supporting characters. 'Fallen Heir' is a crisply written and juicy story that is perfect for all fans of contemporary Young Adult books. This book just clicked for me. And I loved how funny Easton was. His humor and satire was just what this story needed. 
 ""I might be small, but I have the lung capacity of a whale, so if you don't move I'm gonna have to release the oral Kraken until the entire school is in this hallway rescuing me from you."" 
 I crack up. ""The oral Kraken? That sounds pretty dirty."" 
 ""I'm thinking everything sounds dirty to you,"" she says dryly."" 
 This nook ends on a MAJOR cliffhanger which should not be a surprise for fans of this series. WOW!! But never fear, another book is coming in January!! I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it if you're looking for a very smart and witty Young Adult story.

 So sweet!! Filled with tons of romance and some real emotion. Don't read any spoilers for this book! I'm glad I didn't know anything about it. 
 Renee Carlino's books ALWAYS captivate me. 'Swear on This Life' is one of my all-time favorite stories. I will say that Adam is definitely my favorite thing about this book. *SIGH* Adam is one of the most memorable characters ever created by Ms. Carlino. Impulsive, sweet, charming, creative and loving, he really puts himself out there when he meets Charlotte. While I'm not always a fan of insta-love, it just WORKED here. Charlotte opened up her heart to Adam because he seemed, well, absolutely perfect. 
 I was absolutely enchanted by Adam and could understand how Charlotte fell for him. But life has a funny way of working out and things don't turn out quite how Charlotte expected. There was definitely something off about Adam right from the beginning but I couldn't put my finger on it. 
 ""You're stunning and beautiful and I loved every second of it. I'm sorry you didn't like it. Did I hurt you.?"" 
 ""No, but are you going to paint it?"" 
 ""Paint what?"" 
 ""Us, what we just did?"" 
 ""No."" 
 ""No?"" 
 ""No. I don't need to. I'll never forget it and it's sacred."" 
 The story took a lot of twists and turns and it was definitely one that I was not expecting!! Charlotte has had terrible luck at relationships and let's just say that Adam does not turn out to be everything she expected or imagined. Nonetheless, he still feels like the one love of her life, even though they spent a very short time together. 
 Life moves on and Charlotte gets back in to the dating scene. She meets the adorable Seth, who is a minor-league baseball player. He really likes her but she can't quite forget Adam. Seth is patient and sexy and athletic and funny and smart and is just an all-around wonderful man!! But can Charlotte move on from her brief time with Adam? 
 It was like we already knew each other, like we had met in a previous life. Memories that didn't exist began exploding in my mind like fireworks. 
 This is a lovely, romantic, bittersweet story filled with wonderful life lessons about healing and loving. I also adored all of the characters. This is not at all a love triangle (although I love those, too!). Don't read any spoilers about this one, you will enjoy the book so much more going in blind. The conclusion was just lovely and as always with Renee Carlino's stories, I was sorry to see this one end! 
 ""I want you to know that I am grateful to you. I'm grateful to you now. I got to experience IT in this life, and I don't think it's measured with time."" 
 ""You don't think what's measured with time, Adam?"" 
 ""Love, Charlotte.""

 Eve Dangerfield continues to delight with this verrrrrrry kinky and totally filthy story! But she also manages to be funny, heartfelt and utterly original. Highly recommend! 
 ""Everyone is weird, Kate, we're the perfect kind of weird for each other."" 
 Yes, this book is about Daddy kink and it is oh so perfect! Eve Dangerfield writes smart, funny, nuanced characters which is what makes this story so readable. Kate is a young professional who has hidden her sexual fantasies away in shame. The focus of her current obsession is her boss, Ty, a 45 year old gruff, sexy former firefighter who pushes all her buttons. 
 ""Her obsession wasn't even original. Everyone had a crush on Tyler Henderson. Women, gay men, straight men, more perceptive animals. It was like having a crush on a Hemsworth brother--it made you basic as hell. 
 But she thinks Ty can't stand her because he can barely stand to be in the same room as her. He never speaks to her, calls her by her work nickname, and is generally just an all-around grouch. But...but...she's actually perfect for him! Because you see, Ty has always craved D/lg kink but has also hidden it away in shame, settling for unsatisfying relationships that make him feel empty and wanting more. 
 ""Ty didn't think Middleton was a great girl. He thought Middleton was a pain in the ass. Waltzing around with her shiny hair and long legs and her throaty voice, being cuter than a fistful of buttons. Where did she get off? 
 This book is filled with SO much hotness and hilarity and dirty talk that I couldn't believe what I was reading! But the story is SO engaging that I fell in love with Ty from the very first page. And the letter he writes to Kate!! OMG. *Faints* 
 Ty and Kate are so perfect together but only Kate is brave enough to be honest with Ty and her feelings. I LOVED how she accepted what she wanted and who she was and never wavered. Ty was another story. He denied his true desires and felt shame for what he wanted. 
 ""Wanting to fuck his pretty employee was biology, wanting to cherish her was something else. Something much worse. 
 This book is refreshingly funny which balances out the incredibly steamy and passionate scenes. Eve Dangerfield is fearless! And I loved how Kate was far from perfect BUT she was perfect for Ty just the way she was. 
 Ty glared at her. ""Think you're funny, don't you, Middleton?"" 
 ""Yes."" 
 ""Well we'll see how fucking funny you are when your ass is on fire."" 
 This book is set in Australia so it is filled with slang and I did have to look up a few phrases here and there. Please read the book description and if does not sound like your cup of tea, then do not read this one. BUT if you are enamored with D/lg kink, as I am, then by all means read 'Act Your Age'! It is pure, growly Alpha-male goodness through and through. I can't wait to see what Eve Dangerfield dreams up next! 
 What he and Middleton shared had gravity, it would pull her back toward him as surely as the moon pulled at the ocean tides.

 Colleen Hoover is at the top of my auto-buy list. Without question. And she returns to her Young Adult stories in 'Without Merit'. Merit Voss is a teenage girl who in addition to the normal angst of young adulthood, lives in a very unconventional household. From her perspective, her family is just plain WEIRD. No one can seem to get along and most poignantly, no one really seems to notice Merit at all. She almost seems like an afterthought. 
 ""I can say with certainty that we live in the most unusual house in this whole town. I say house because it is certainly not a home. And inside this house are seven of the most unusual occupants. No one would be able to determine from the outside of our house that our family of seven includes an atheist, a home wrecker, an ex-wife suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia, and a teenage girl whose weird obsession borders on necrophilia. 
 Of course, Merit is a classic unreliable narrator and slowly the truth about her family emerges. Colleen Hoover knows how to treat delicate subjects with great dignity and care. She makes the entire cast of odd characters here sympathetic and very likable even though you may think the opposite of them at first. 
 Merit decides to just stop attending school. No one seems to even notice! While skipping school she meets a cute guy and they share an earth-shattering kiss. BUT Merit actually has a twin sister named Honor and the cute guy is actually Sagan, her twin's boyfriend. It seems as though Sagan might have thought he was kissing Honor. 
 Merit is angry and surly and can't seem to make many friends. She is offended when Sagan starts eating meals with the family and basically moving in. How could this have happened? 
 ""I'm confused by two things. One being the constant and repeated presence of Honor's boyfriend at our breakfast table. Two being the fact that everyone seems to know him so well that they're perfectly fine with him joining in on the family conversation. 
 Merit eventually uncovers some very hard truths about her family's past. It also becomes very clear that Honor is not the perfect person that she at first thinks herself to be. Like all of Colleen Hoover's characters, Merit is unforgettable. She must make some hard choices about herself, her family and Sagan. 
 ""Sagan just doesn't say mean things out loud. Maybe that's a product of how he was raised. Or maybe he's some kind of saint. Or an angel brought to earth to test my morals."" 
 I loved the message of this book!! The story is beautiful and the characters feel real and flawed and very relatable. The description of small-town Texas seems spot-on. Fans of Colleen Hoover will devour this story, and hopefully new readers will pick this one up and see why her readers are so devoted to her writing. Unconditional love, loyalty and forgiveness are some heavy topics but Ms. Hoover serves them up perfectly here.

 ""It would've been romantic if I wasn't drunk as a skunk when I dialed him."" 
 I am a die-hard Penelope Ward fan. I DEVOUR her books. And this one started off very strong for me! I loved the premise of the story: ugly-duckling Rana finds her childhood friend Landon online when she is drunk one night and calls him and unleashes years of pent-up frustration. Rana grew up very poor in Michigan and her family rented their apartment from Landon's family. She was forced to suddenly move when she was young and lost touch with her former best friend Landon. 
 However, the truth turns out to be a little different than what Rana was told and she and Landon begin to talk on the phone and it becomes very clear they both have very strong feelings for each other. 
 Penelope Ward is the queen of second-chance romance as well as creating a sold backstory for her characters. I didn't quite feel that connection between Rana and Landon but many readers loved this one so definitely give it a try. The story has some very valuable messages about self-esteem and forgiveness. And the sexy times are incredibly HOT!! I would have liked a little more build-up to the full-blown relationship between Landon and Rana. BUT I did fall in the love with Landon: like all of Ms. Ward's main characters, he is simply unforgettable!! 
 His hands may have been calloused; his arms may have been inked; he may have looked dangerous, but Landon was as gentle as he was protective. 
 'Drunk Dial' is a light and sexy story that delivers a HEA. While it is not my favorite Penelope Ward book, I nonetheless enjoyed reading it and loved the second-chance, friends to lovers storyline. This is a sexy, passionate and often funny book with lots of emotion. Enjoy Landon Roderick! I know I did. 
 Our story was a lot like a Rubik's Cube - colourful and complicated. It took years to work it out, but then suddenly like magic, on a random Sunday, everything all came together.

 Dr. Simon Hogue is a sexy British physician who meets single-mom Bridget in the cutest way possible. Both are single: Bridget is a widowed nurse with not much of a social life and Simon is a gorgeous doctor with no interest in a relationship. 
 There's tons of humor, sexy talk and a hottie British doctor. What's not to love? After an embarrassing ""meet cute"" with Simon, Bridget ends up renting a room in her home to him in order to make ends meet. It's not permanent: Simon is only in the US to complete his residency and then he will be back off to Britain. He loves to tease Bridget and their attraction is mutual. So he proposes a deal: a no-strings attached, sex-only relationship until he leaves. 
 The authors put a fresh spin on the friends-to-lovers trope that is sexy and enticing. There's not much angst but the storyline is fast-paced and engaging. Bridget doesn't want her son to get too attached to Simon so she is careful not to get attached. But Simon soon finds himself falling in love with Bridget and her son, too. 
 ""The sexy, blond, god of a doctor whom I'd masturbated to for weeks after the fish hook incident...was now my roommate."" 
 This is a swoony romance with lots of heart and tons of heat. The authors always throw in a twist for dramatic tension and it worked perfectly here! The letter-writing is a cute addition and I loved the funny, charming, dirty-talking Brit!! Another passionate, sweet and heart-warming story from a great writing duo.

 This was my first book by Jeannine Colette and I really enjoyed it! Nothing too over the top here, just a sweet and sexy small-town romance featuring one hot cop and a feisty heroine. 
 Leah is determined to own the bar where she works and I loved that aspect of the book. The author also seems to have a wicked sense of humor which shows in the funny banter and the hilarious Matthew McConaughey references. Leah lost her first love to an overdose, and he also happened to be Adam's best friend - Adam, the rigid, by-the-book policeman who seems determined to punish Leah for her past mistakes. 
 Adam is charitable and gorgeous and kind and protective. He has made it his mission in life to rid the town of narcotics. When Leah is sentenced to community service under Adam's supervision, the sparks begin to fly. 
 Even though the setting is in the Midwest, this story has almost a sassy, Southern feel to it, reminiscent of Abbi Glines and Harper Sloan's early books. I love a blue-collar hero and Luke fits the bill perfectly! 
 Adam was cold and harsh and downright mean for much of the story, until Leah begins to break through to him. The chemistry between these two was HOT HOT HOT! I applaud Ms. Colette for her strong and sassy heroine and absolutely loved Leah. She wasn't just a party girl and earns the respect of everyone around her. 'Wrecked' is a funny, sexy, small-town romance that is a great way to spend a few hours.

 ""If I ever lay eyes on you again... I can't promise I'll do what's best and walk away next time..."" 
 Fancy a fast-paced, well-written sexy romance? 'The Forbidden' is all that and more!! This is not so much a taboo romance as it is the story of two people who simply meet at the wrong time. Annie is an up-and-coming, career-driven architect who has no time for relationships. She has just never felt that ""spark"" with any man. Jack and Annie meet one night in a bar when she is out for a fun night with friends. They have an immediate connection that only Jodi-Ellen Malpas can make seem SO real. 
 Jack's marriage was over long before he met Annie. While some might see this as a bright line that should never be crossed, Jack instead seemed to me to be sweet, vulnerable and craving an intimate connection. Annie for one cannot believe she has found herself in this situation but Jack is everything she never knew she wanted. 
 ""I would never have put myself in this situation for anything less than powerful love. The kind that keeps you going. The kind that gives you breath and life. Jack's my life. He's my pulse. He's everything."" 
 This story would be empty and unconvincing in the hands of a less talented writer. But JEM really creates nuanced characters with hard choices to make. Nothing is black and white here. While the story got a little too over-dramatic for me near the end, I nonetheless loved this book and highly recommend it!

His story is a standalone, and does NOT feature any forbidden romance. Andrew is the complete opposite of Amelia, the boss of his sister and a total Type-A workaholic. She has been burned by a painful split from her husband and is going through a very difficult divorce. Amelia and Andrew make is clear from the start they are both only looking for a one-night stand, with no strings attached. Andrew does not suffer from lack of women, that's for sure - he's totally hot, has his own business and has an adorable daughter named Bell, who is raising on his own. 
 They are both completely honest with each other from the start but begin to develop a deeper connection. Their emotional relationship develops slowly, even though they both are wary of getting close. Amelia is stunning, smart and self-sufficient, Never in a million years does she think she could ever fall for a man like Andrew! And Andrew's daughter comes first, even while it becomes obvious his daughter would love for him to fall in love. I loved that Andrew was the one who actually starts to realize that he is falling in love with Amelia and wants more from her. 
 Somewhere along the way, she became worth it to me. The threat of pain that comes with keeping her in my life--it's not enough to scare me away. In fact, it's the threat of competition that stokes a fire in me. It makes me want to put up a fight. 
 The First Taste is a classic opposites-attract story, filled with real emotion and characters that have depth and honesty. Jessica Hawkins is great at writing uber-sexy men and Andrew is not only gorgeous and tatted, he is a VERY giving lover. The sexy times in The First Taste are without a doubt some of the steamiest around. 
 ""I want to undress you, stretch you out on my bed, fingers to toes. Your hair splayed on my pillow and I want to take you over and over until you can't handle it another second."" 
 I love stories with single dads and while this story did not pack as much of an emotional punch as Slip of the Tongue, I still loved the story and the way Amelia and Andrew's relationship grew and developed. This is a fast and sexy read from an incredibly talented writer and I can't wait to read what's next!!

 I. LOVED. THIS. BOOK. 
 A sharp and insightful commentary on our modern culture and obsession with celebrity, 'The Idea of You' is also a fantastic, sexy romance. This book really did it for me. If this is Robinne Lee's first book, I cannot wait see what comes next! 
 Solene is a sophisticated, 39 year old divorced working mom who finds herself swept up into an exciting and sexy relationship with the world-famous Hayes Campbell, the 20 year old member of a famous ""boy band"". She is an educated and successful gallerist who is divorced from her ex-husband, who has a younger girlfriend. The world does not take kindly to Solene's relationship with Hayes, mainly because of the 20 year age difference. I loved the commentary on ageism in our society today. The public will accept an older man with a younger girlfriend but frowns upon the older woman/younger man dynamic. 
 Solene is acutely aware of the age difference but is enjoying an awakening of sorts with Hayes, Ah, the joys of a younger boyfriend! What starts out as ""just lunch"" soon becomes much, much more. 
 ""I just want to look at you for a moment."" 
 ""You've been looking at me for over an hour."" 
 ""Yeah, but before I was trying not to be obvious about it. Come here."" He led me over to the daybed against the far wall and pulled me onto his lap. I could feel him through his pants. Oh, the wonders of twenty. 
 Solene at first tries to hide her relationship with Hayes from her young daughter. I knew this was going to be a disaster and her daughter at first does not handle the news well at all. But doesn't Solene deserve to be happy? She struggles not only with her ex-husband's reaction to the news but also with her daughter's. 
 The entire time Isabelle had been just across the hall on the phone with her friend, oblivious to her mother going down the rabbit hole. Face-first. 
 One of the things I loved most about this book was the sharp look at our obsession with celebrity. Hayes could not go anywhere without being mobbed, and even a causal trip to the store to buy a shirt led to a mob scene. He was used to it; Solene was not. This story made me re-think every headline I read about celebrities. Hayes wanted Solene to know him, and NOT ""the idea"" of him. Hayes was tender, sweet, funny, sexy and much wiser than his 20 years. 
 ""You want to be kissed, Solene?"" His hands were in my hair, pushing it off of my face, cradling my neck. 
 ""Yes."" I nodded. 
 ""You think you can handle that?"" 
 ""I'll see what I can do."" 
 Robinne Hill gets her locations right. From Miami, to Malibu, to Manhattan and Paris, I felt as if I was THERE, experiencing the cafes, the clubs, the chic art galleries and the screaming fans at the huge concerts. This book really checked all the boxes for me!! I simply cannot recommend it highly enough. I am having a hard time moving on from this book. Would I love a sequel? YES. But I would also gladly welcome another book from Ms. Hill. Grab 'The Idea of You' and enjoy a fabulous time with this perfect beach read. I adored it. 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ""You're making me blush,"" he laughed, tipping his head back. His jawline from this angle was well-defined, exquisite, like art. His beauty, like a gift that kept revealing itself.

 OMG!! Refreshing, smart, fun and swoony, I LOVED this book!! It was just what I needed. My favorite R.S. Grey book since 'Scoring Wilder'. If you are looking for something totally light and sexy, this book is for you! 
 Madeleine is an adorable and quirky heroine who is trying her best to get her life together. As a somewhat unsuccessful realtor, she adores her giant dog named Mouse (cute, right?) and loves her family and best friend Daisy. But her love life? Non-existent. DOA. That is, until the new veterinarian Dr. Adam Foxe arrives in town. But the good doctor is coming off a bitter break-up and is cynical and not looking for love, etc etc. Until Mouse (and Madeleine crash into his life!) 
 They strike up a mutually beneficial deal. A fake dating arrangement to satisfy Adam's nosy family and he will buy a house through Madeleine. Let the hilarity (and hormones) ensue! 
 ""No. No. A family barbecue is serious! This was not part of the deal."" 
 ""Technically, you agreed to do anything I needed you to do."" 
 ""That's when I thought you'd be asking me for a lung or something!"" 
 ""So you were prepared to donate an organ, but a family barbecue is suddenly too much pressure?"" 
 ""Don't try to be cute."" 
 Adam's family is charmed by Madeleine. And who wouldn't be? She is a sincere and honest and refreshingly REAL MC. 
 ""And you brought cookies?"" she asks, eyeing the Tupperware in my hand. 
 ""Freshly baked this morning,"" I brag. 
 She turns over her shoulder to Adam, who's following us into the house with Mouse by his side. ""I love her already!"" 
 I bask in her praise. After the months from hell I've had recently, this is a much-needed reprieve. Hell, if all else fails, maybe I'll date Adam's mom? 
 'The Foxe & the Hound"" is a delightfully sexy story with the perfect amount of humor and heat. I loved the banter, the characters and the charming small-town Texas setting. I swear, R.S. Grey could be a TV comedy writer, that's how funny her dialogue is!! 
 ""I want to take a pair of scissors to her loud highlights, but I misplaced the scissors I usually keep in my top drawer a few months ago. Instead, I'm forced to stand, hang up on Daisy, and follow Lori over to the conference room with pen and paper in hand. We're the first two to arrive. She takes her usual spot beside Helen's chair, and I pick a spot on the opposite end of the table. Her perfume is strong. Chanel number five, she told me once, bragging. Oh really? On you it smells like a number two. 
 This was THE perfect read for a summer day or a weekend at the beach. I fell in love with Adam and Madeleine and the fictional setting of Hamilton, Texas. Bravo, Ms. Grey!! Keep writing more books like this one.

 Beautiful and poignant yet very violent spin-off from the Nine Minutes series. Lots of unexpected twists and turns! 
 I loved the storyline and the originality of the plot. Even though I was familiar with Anthony Bear and Christy from the Nine Minutes series, this book really explored their relationship and Anthony's early life. 
 I could not WAIT for this book to come out since Beth Flynn is a very special and talented writer. The Nine Minutes Series is one of my all-time FAVORITE biker romances and I recommend it to anyone who will listen! 
 Anthony is a fighter. Faced with racism from a young age, he clawed his way to the top and created one of the most feared and most successful illegal businesses on the West Coast of Florida. He is Boss. When a large debt is owed to him, he sets out to collect. 
 He kidnaps the daughter of the man who owes him, but Christy Chapman is not at all what he expected. Anthony has preconceived notions about her which turn out to be all wrong. 
 Christy judged Anthony at first, too. Not quite the pampered heiress that Anthony thought she was, they both surprise each other along the way. 
 Although I finished this book, it was a little slow going for me at times. The third-person voice prevented me from really connecting with these characters. That being said, this was an incredibly inventive story and as always, I ADORE the Florida setting of Beth Flynn's books. The colorful characters and unflinching violence add to the genuine feel of the plot. I hope that there are more books planned for the Beth Flynn's cast of characters because I will be first in line to read her next book!

 ""When life happened, it did it in a heartbeat. That space between time. A first inhale, a last exhale. The dawn of realization, the eve of what was and never again would be."" 
 What an unexpected and refreshing surprise!!! This book is unlike anything I've ever read. And please don't read any spoilers! The author just totally blew me away with the plot and the characters and the FEELS! 
 Let me just say that Parker was one of my favorite MC's EVER. Strong, funny, self-deprecating, she is basically just waiting for her life to begin. She has a chip on her shoulder and blames everyone else for the position she's in. But there is so much more to her story!! 
 ""If Amazon Prime offered a life, she would have one-clicked the hell out of it and selected recurring monthly delivery."" 
 This book is NOT what you think. The plot is inventive and sexy and emotional. It is pure Jewel E. Ann. This book took me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and I did not want it to end! Parker finds herself in THE one situation that she swore she would never be in. Funny how life is, right? Despite her best intentions, she realizes that life is not black and white but is shades of grey. And family does mean everything. 
 ""Temptation no longer resided in his blind spot. She lived a hundred yards away. 
 This book is funny and steamy and just plain REAL. I am trying not to give away any of the plot because this book is best read without knowing anything about the story or the characters. It is another delightfully different story from one of the best indie authors writing today. Pick up 'When Life Happened.' You will be delighted and challenged and entertained. 
 The truth doesn't always set you free, and lies are not always deception.

 ""When truth is replaced by silence, the silence is a lie."" 
 -- Yevgeny Yevtushenko 
 'The Child's is a haunting and emotional character-driven suspense novel that also explores our modern-day obsession with 24/7 news. 
 Angela's newborn baby was kidnapped from her hospital room several decades earlier. The baby was never found. Angela and her husband Nick carried on after their devastating loss but Angela never fully recovered. When the bones of an infant are found at a construction site, she is sure the body is that of her long-gone Baby Alice. 
 Kate is a brilliant newspaper journalist who uncovers news stories the old-fashioned way: through leg work and research and determination. She was also featured in the author's previous book 'The Widow' which I am now going to read! I loved Kate's style. While this book started off just a tiny bit slow, it picked up the pace in the middle and thundered toward an unbelievably shocking conclusion. 
 ""I've always thought that's a funny saying. Let sleeping dogs lie. Because sleeping dogs always wake up eventually, don't they?"" 
 Emma is married to a university professor many years her senior. She is devastated by the news of the ""Building Site Baby' but why? She has no apparent ties to Angela's family. Emma has had a difficult relationship with her mother Jude but it seems the two are trying to make peace with each other now that Emma is grown and married. But Emma has secrets of her own that will devastate everyone close to her when they are revealed. 
 The multiple points of view are executed brilliantly. Each narrator has their own unique voice and are each vital to the story. 
 'The Child' is an imaginative and surprising thriller. While the writing is filled with British slang and customs, that only added to my enjoyment of the story. 
 There are many twists and turns to this book and the ending was far more touching than I expected from what I though would be a suspense novel. The conclusion was enormously satisfying! Highly recommend this book for all thriller fans as well as anyone who loves a great story. 
 ""People say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. They say that when you been through something terrible ... But it doesn't. It breaks your bones, leaving everything splintered and held together with grubby bandages and yellowing sticky tape. Creaking along the fault lines, Fragile and exhausting to hold together. Sometimes you wish it had killed you.""

Highly recommend this one for fans of KA - this book is all about a strong heroine; a stand-up, Alpha hero; and some fast-moving danger. Loved the descriptions of the breathtaking Montana scenery. 
 I'm a HUGE fan of second-chance romance and this one fit the bill perfectly. This is the second book in the Jamison Valley series and centers around Nick, Jesse's friend. (This book can be read as a standalone but I HIGHLY recommend the first book because it is fantastic!) It's no spoiler that Nick and Emmeline (Emmy) were married in Las Vegas many years earlier and surprise! They meet up again very unexpectedly after many years apart, when she moves to his small town. 
 ""Nick?"" Gigi asked, but I didn't speak or take my eyes off Emmy. She was frozen just like I was. Finally, Emmy broke away. 
 ""Sorry. I have to go,"" she mumbled before racing to the door. 
 ""What was that? Do you know her?"" Jess asked. 
 Yeah. I knew her. ""She's my wife."" 
 There is a delicious slow-burn aspect to this story even though Nick and Emmy are still legally married. Emmy now has a boyfriend, and had given up ever finding Nick after years of searching turned up nothing (there's a good reason for that which is revealed later in the book!). Nick broke her heart when he left her after their impulsive wedding in Vegas. Emmy and Nick were from two very different worlds, but now their paths have crossed again when she takes a teaching job in Prescott, Montana. 
 Nick is a sexy and sweet Alpha but Emmy resists him despite his incredibly tender and romantic gestures. Even though they are husband and wife, they really didn't know each other at all. If you are a fan of small-town romance, you will love this book. There is plenty of action and just the right amount of heat. Although story did not have the ""wow"" factor that 'The Coppersmith Farmhouse' had, I still raced through this book and absolutely fell in love with the characters. 
 I am obsessed with this series and cannot wait for more stories about the other characters. Ms. Perry obviously has a great deal of love for her setting and it shows in her writing. 'The Clover Chapel' is a heart-warming, funny, sexy and very adult romance that enthralled me and entertained me to the very last word. I am thrilled that the third book in the series, 'The Lucky Heart' is coming in August! I can't wait to return to Jamison Valley.

But at the same time, I feel like if I could live through that, what happened to us, then I can survive anything. Like, what is there really to be afraid of?"" 
 This book has SO much going for it! A Bittersweet, friends-to-lovers story; a feisty and relatable heroine; AND a bad-boy hero. Kylie Scott is one of my favorite authors and 'Lick' remains one of my top favorite contemporary romance books. For those reasons, I stuck with this story and I'm so glad that I did. Edie is VERY different from most fictional heroines and for that, I applaud Ms. Scott. For once, the ordinary girl gets the guy! 
 ""Kissing John was everything. Well, not everything everything. I wouldn't die without him. But all of me wanted him, my heart and my head and all of the rest. Without a doubt, he made life better."" 
 John and Edie experienced a life-changing trauma and it pretty much bonds them together. No one else can understand what they went through that fateful night at the convenience story and they have a tough time relating to their teachers, families and friends. They end up attending the same high school and I loved what the author had to say about bullying, fat-shaming and teenage angst. There are some light-hearted moments in this story as well and if Ms. Scott writes more YA novels, I will be first in line! With that said, there were some minor inconsistencies that took me out of the story a bit (there seemed to be some Aussie-speak thrown in - no American teenager uses some of the language that the author used) but all in all this was a sweet, funny and sexy romance that kept me turning the pages until the very end.

 OMG this is one of THE funniest and absolutely dirtiest books I've ever read! Eve Dangerfield has a fresh and VERY unique voice and I adored this story. 
 ""You're stunning,"" he said, eyeing her up and down. His irises weren't watery blue like most redheads, but a warm caramel brown. Ash's lady areas tingled, as though they too craved a cigarette. 
 ""Thanks."" 
 Can I keep this review clean? Hard to do, based on how naughty this book is. Ashley is a hard-working nurse who has THE worst taste in men and decides she is finished with boyfriends. What she wants is a baby and a good sperm donor. A former model, Ash was a party girl but has always been sensitive about her lower-class background and loser parents. Raised by her grandmother, she and her sister Julia are best friends and share everything. 
 Julia's boyfriend Max has a gorgeous red-headed roommate named Dean. A big lovable bear of a man, Dean has coasted through life but when he meets Ash, that's IT for him. And Ash feels the same. A ginger? No way! 
 He wasn't a pretty boy, his nose was crooked and his grin lopsided, but he had that square-jawed, salt-of-the-earth handsome look that made a girl think of loose-hipped cowboys and demanding Scottish Lairds. And speaking of Scottish Lairds, old mate was a redhead. Usually gingers weren't her scene but this guy's hair was the rich coppery-auburn of a fox's pelt. It gleamed like rose gold under the floodlights, his short beard the exact colour as the stuff on his head. Big Red was doing it for her. Big time. And apparently, the feeling was mutual."" 
 Dean is one of the most original MC's I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Sensitive, kind, loving, he wears his heart on his sleeve. Trouble is, he has a tiny little problem focusing and drifts off right in the middle of a thought. Ash wants to use him but he wants more from her! What a fun change of pace from the usual contemporary romance books I read. 
 ""You women, always trying to rush straight to sex. Whatever happened to romance?"" 
 Dean and Ash were perfect together. There's tons of Australian slang and references in this book but they did not distract from the story. Between the 'Princess Bride' references, the Tessa Bailey mention and the hilarious and STEAMY sex scenes, this book was a win for me. The dialogue crackles and the characters are all well-written and so REAL. I can't put my finger on what makes a book work for me, but 'Open Hearts' has ""it."" I couldn't book this book down! Filled with heat, heart and humor, 'Open Hearts' is one of my favorite books this year. 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ""He had to be six-four or five, lean, but beefy everywhere it counted. How would all that weight feel bearing down on her? She imagined his handsome face screwed up in pleasure as he pounded away at her practically revirginized p---y. Everything below her belly button tightened."" 
 ""They'd tried to diagnose him but there was no apparent medical explanation for his behaviour. He was just what his mum called 'away with the fairies' and Max called 'a bit of a lost 
 c--t.'"" 
 ""You're my dream girl, Ash. No one even comes close.""",Thu May 04 10:03:17 -0700 2017,Sun Jun 25 12:39:26 -0700 2017,Sun Jun 25 12:39:26 -0700 2017,Tue Jun 20 23:00:58 -0700 2017,10,0

 OH YES!!! I loved this fun and spicy slow-burn sports romance!! 'Illegal Contact' has the perfect mix of romance and heat. Any sports-romance lover will adore this story!! 
 Football superstar Gavin Brawley of the New York Barons has major anger issues. A tough guy who grew up in the foster system, he is caught on video assaulting a man and as a result, is put on six months of house arrest. What is was really doing was protecting his friend but Gavin will take his punishment even though it means he is suspending from playing football, the only thing that saved him from a life of total despair. 
 Most fans think Gavin is a total asshole. And he does little to nothing to dispel the public's opinion of him. In reality, he is a deeply closeted bisexual who has just a few close friends in his inner circle. He trusts no one outside his tight-knit circle. But because Gavin is a prisoner in his own home (a stunning mansion in the Hamptons), he is forced by his long-time manager to hire a PA to shop for him, cook his meals and run his errands. But Gavin is dead-set against this idea because he really doesn't like most people and he just wants to be left alone. 
 ""I was a multimillionaire and a famous athlete, and yet people still treated me like a dirt-poor street kid from Newark. Some things never changed."" 
 Noah Monroe is in desperate need of a job. His last one ended badly and his father was just laid off. His student loans are looming over his head. He knows absolutely zero about football but that adds to his charm. And so he has no idea who Gavin Brawley is either. He is completely clueless but must find a job as soon as possible. He is out of options and will take any job, even if it is way outside his chosen field of social work. 
 ""Was that the celebrity I'd be servicing? Bad choice of words. Was that the celebrity I'd be . . . personally assisting? I wasn't too clear on what this job would even entail. I'd just been told to send my resume and cover letter to Joe's receptionist."" 
 Of course Noah and Gavin cannot stand each other at first! Gavin is a total jerk to Noah. 
 ""The man I hired has worked for movie stars, Gavin. He understands discretion."" 
 ""I don't give a shit if he understands quantum physics. He's more likely to land on the moon than set foot in this ridiculous mansion."" 
 I adore an enemies-to-lovers story. Gavin and Noah could not be more different. Gavin tries to shut Noah out of his life but he has to admit, Noah begins to do an amazing job as his PA. Noah begins to answer the huge amount of fan mail that has been accumulating and starts a social media presence for Gavin. So the fans actually begin to like Gavin Brawley. Gavin is wildly attracted to Noah but as a closeted bisexual, he feels that coming out would ruin his football career. Santino Hassell does a fantastic job of building their relationship from intense dislike, to friendship, to sweet, sweet romance. I could not put this story down! The sex scenes are CRAZY hot. Even when Noah and Gavin were breaking my heart, I just knew these two had to have a HEA. And boy, did they ever. 
 I finished with my hands in his hair and our lips crushed together. It was an orgasm worthy of Olympic medals, but what really stopped my heart was the sound of my name in his lust-soaked voice. We were both in trouble. 
 When Gavin finally begins to trust Noah, it is a beautiful thing. The banter, the sexy flirting, the touches of humor - it all worked for me. There is a second book planned in this series for Gavin's friend and teammate Simeon and let me just say that it sounds all kinds of awesome. I already miss these guys!! 
 Gavin cocked a brow. ""If you think I'm going to try to spare your delicate baby eyes, I suggest you readjust your expectations. FYI--after showering, I air dry.""",Thu Apr 27 22:44:30 -0700 2017,Tue Aug 15 05:57:10 -0700 2017,Mon Aug 14 13:49:10 -0700 2017,Sun Aug 13 12:27:48 -0700 2017,9,2

 I am one of Katy's biggest fans and read everything she writes! I always love her powerful heroes and Aaric Christos is one of her best Alphas! Strong, driven and brilliant, I loved everything about him. . 
 ""It's never been a game with you."" 
 Bryn is in desperate need of funding for her start-up company. She has risen from her past tragedies and is determined to make her new business successful. But first she must convince Aaric to lend her the money to get her business off the ground. 
 Aaric is now very much involved with a wealthy socialite girlfriend but Bryn and Aaric have a past and knew each other years before. I loved the second-chance romance aspect of this story! Along with the New Your City setting, this was a perfectly enjoyable contemporary romance with Katy Evans' trademark brand of HOT sexiness. Will Bryn be able to put aside her personal feelings so that she and Aaric can keep things strictly business? 
 ""He's the biggest what if I've ever had in my life. The one you always wonder about."" 
 There's some drama here but it works in the story. I loved Aaric's point of view and feel that it really gave his character depth. He seemed so allofll of at first but then really became someone I was rooting for by the end. The sexy times are perfect and it all added up to a fast-paced and enjoyable contemporary romance. 
 I would have loved to have learned more about Aaric and Bryn when they were younger; the flashback scenes left me wanting more! If you are a fan of Katy Evans and of second-chance romance, you will love this one!

 Holy moly!!! What to say about this delicious, erotic, COMPLETELY taboo romance? Enter at your own risk!! Reading this book was like riding a roller coaster - my emotions were all over the place. Ms. Saffron Kent is an author to watch. And Professor Thomas Abrams? I honestly have no words. 
 Some books have ""it"" - an undefinable quality that hooks the reader from the beginning and doesn't let go. 'The Unrequited' has ""it."" Once I started reading this steamy forbidden romance, I simply could not put it down. 
 ""Bravery is like falling in love. You donaEUR(tm)t know if the person will reciprocate, but still you fall. "" 
 Heed the warnings in the synopsis, and if you are not a fan of forbidden romance or cheating, then move along. But there is SO much more to this book! Thomas and Layla's story is very nuanced and adult and very complicated. And so, so erotic!! 
 ""The Harlot fell in love with the Fire-breather. It was beautiful and right. It was wrong and ugly, just like the earth beneath my feet. It was tragic and ecstatic. It was everything IaEUR(tm)d hoped love could be."" 
 Saffon Kent did a fantastic job creating two very different protagonists. Layla is passionate, self-deprecating, very open and brutally honest. She is a true original. Thomas is brilliant, sexy, introspective and sarcastic. Layla is heartbroken and possibly crazy after being rejected by her one true love. She is required to enroll in college and attend class as part of her therapy. She ends up in Professor Thomas Abrams' poetry class and immediately realizes she is in way over her head. He is rude to her and sees through her charade. 
 But Thomas has secrets, too. Yes he is married but there is much, much more to his story than just that simple fact. Cold, aloof and arrogant, he is the complete opposite of Layla.

 STUNNING!! Ms. Reisz proves once again she is the Queen of erotica. The story and characters are all richly drawn and unforgettable. Mona Lisa St. James made a promise to her mother that she would do anything at all to save their art gallery. But the gallery is in financial trouble and she must sell it. And soon. 
 But then a handsome Englishman arrives and makes her an irresistible offer. He will save her gallery. But she must agree to be his for one year. 
 ""You were meant to do this,"" he said softly. ""You'll see."" 
 ""Why me?"" she asked. ""Millions of women in this country, millions in yours...why me?"" 
 ""Millions of paintings in this world. Only one Mona Lisa. Billions of women in this world. Only one you, Mona Lisa St. James."" 
 And so begins the most erotic and sensual adventures Mona has ever had. A sexual awakening of sorts, Mona and the mysterious Malcolm shares his most erotic and depraved fantasies. Yet each and every encounter is sexy and beautiful and simply stunning!! Malcolm is judgement-free and slowly begins to understand her true nature and what life has in store for her. 
 I can't even begin to describe how incredibly sensual and hot the scenes between Mona and Malcolm are. Each of their encounters is a wild and delightful fantasy, interwoven with mythology, history and lush eroticism. 
 ""Is this all a dream?"" That's the only thing that makes any sense. 
 ""You aren't dreaming,"" he said, and she knew that was true. She was awake and had been every time they had met. ""But if you were a dream, would you want to wake up?"" he asked. 
 A good question. A fair question. A hard question, but one she answered easily. 
 ""Never."" 
 I absolutely loved the conclusion to this gorgeous story. It was surprising and thrilling and completely satisfying! I fell in love with the rakish Malcolm. This book is unlike anything I've ever read. Tiffany Reisz writes with sensuality and skill. 'The Red' is a must-read for all erotic romance lovers!!

 Just WOW. I had high hopes for 'Fury' and Cat Porter exceeded every single one of my expectations and then some!! A gritty, incredibly sensual and emotional thrill ride. Put this one on your must-read list! 
 ""Why did we have to sacrifice love for love?"" 
 This is a story that spans decades and offers up the very best in the MC romance genre. There are many biker books out there but Cat Porter is one of the most talented writers in this genre. From the minute we first meet Lenore, she is tortured, anguished an abused. Finger is a young prospect being held prisoner and their bonds are forged in fire. 
 Finger never forgets Lenore. She is branded onto his soul. There's is a love story that literally spans many years but cannot be denied. Once again, Ms. Porter writes characters that are devastatingly honest and real and their emotions are raw and brutal. The MC life is not an easy one. Many scenes in this book are raw and graphic. But through it all, Finger and Lenore rise above their savage pasts. 
 ""Hell and heaven. Beautiful and horrible. We found each other first in the dark and then in the light and in all the shadows in between. No matter how I tried convincing myself that I should forget, the scars never allowed it."" 
 'Fury' is a total roller-coaster ride of emotions. It takes a lot for me to cry but this book brought me to my knees! Never in a million years did I expect the twist to this book. AND, as if there wasn't enough to love about this story, I fell in love with Tania! HELLO. 
 My favorite books involve couples who are older and have lived and experienced life. 'Fury' delivers that and then some. Finger and Lenore have suffered and triumphed through so much, I was hoping against hope that they would find their happy ending. Loyalty, brotherhood, love, devotion, revenge and friendship...'Fury' has it all. Don't miss this one!!

 Sweet and lovely and important and fresh. Love the message of this book! 
 Autoboyography is a beautifully written and very poignant M/M story with a MESSAGE. On the one hand is Tanner, a bisexual teen whose family accepts him and loves him for who he is, On the other hand is Sebastian, a devoted member of the Church of LDS whose rigid and intensely religious family strictly follows the doctrines of the church. Where homosexuality is forbidden. 
 Tanner moved from California to Provo, Utah with his family when his mother accepted a wonderful job there. Although ""out"" to his family, he cannot be openly bisexual due to the overwhelmingly Mormon majority of his classmates, friends and the town. He falls hard for Sebastian, when he meets Seb in a writing class. Sebastian is about to have his first book published and is something of a celebrity around school and in town. He is also the teaching assistant for the writing class. The goal of the class is to write a book by the end of the course. 
 ""Come on. I moved here when I was fifteen--which I think we can agree is the worst time to move from Palo Alto, California, to Provo, Utah--with a mouth full of metal and no friends. I have stories."" Not to mention I'm a half-Jewish queer kid in a straight and Mormon town. 
 Tanner becomes infatuated with Sebastian, but has no clue if his feelings are reciprocated. He is unsure if he is reading the signals wrong, or if Sebastian is just deeply closeted. Sebastian helps Tanner with his book. Could it be even remotely possible that Sebastian is gay? 
 ""But how can I send my heart to him when he's just said, in no uncertain terms, that he doesn't speak its language?"" 
 My heart ached for Sebastian and Tanner. Yes they did fall in love. And Sebastian's religion made him feel worthless and unloved by God and rejected by his family. He struggled with his feelings but knew that his family would never, ever accept his sexual orientation. So perfect from the outside, his family was actually intensely judgmental. 
 I adored Tanner and the sweet romance that developed between these two. This is not a steamy romance at all but it was very passionate and sweet and believable and REAL. While the beliefs of the Mormon church sometimes felt like they were being recited from a textbook, I understood how Sebastian could be so torn between his service to the Church, and his desire to live an authentic life. How beautiful it was that he finally found someone to love. 
 There are no evil characters here. Sebastian's parents simply see no other path for their son other than his upcoming missionary work for three years. That is what they did, and that is what is expected of Sebastian. This book is about having the courage to stand up for your principles and for who you are. When Sebastian finally realizes that, he has already broken Tanner's heart. This book is a journey that asks some tough and heartbreaking questions along the way. 
 Seb and Tanner were hot for each other. It was a healthy exploration of their sexuality, but Seb's parents got to him and influenced him break up with Tanner. 
 These are two sweet, loyal, kind and funny boys. They deserve happiness! I think it is hard for most people to accept a church that basically cuts parents off from their own children based on who they love. 
 Overall I enjoyed the book because Tanner and Seb were so endearing and brave. I felt that the constant reminder that Tanner was a ""half-Jew in a Mormon town"" was overused, I got it the first 3 times it was mentioned . (Also not a fan of the new trend of placing a Nordstrom in virtually town in books. That takes me out of the book. If that part is fictional, what else about the LDS is made up? That's my dilemma.) 
 Hopefully the LDS Church will have a ""revelation"" soon about coming out as gay or bi so that all of the wonderful young people can lead a full life with the love and acceptance of their families, friends and church.

And this book was a perfectly sexy, fast-paced and truly engrossing story. And the cover...WOW!! One of my favorite covers ever and that is very important to me in deciding whether to read a book. 
 The description is fabulous and the first half of the book was really fantastic. Just what I love in a contemporary romance. Valentina has been hurt by her husband William, and decides to stay in Paris alone when William cancels his travel plans there. Their trip was going to be an effort to reconnect as husband and wife, and re-kindle their love for each other. 
 Valentina has become somewhat lost in her marriage, and feels that Paris will give her freedom and the opportunity to find her true self once again. She feels herself growing stronger as a person every day, and falls in love with the city. 
 ""My arms outstretched, I'd danced to the vibrant music of life. I prayed for romance, adventure, the unknown. I wanted to fall in love and love to the point of no return. I wanted the turmoil, the stress, the upheaval, and chaos--the Sturm und Drang."" 
 And Sebastien. HOLY HELL!! I loved him from the minute he was introduced into the story!! A sexy French artist, what could be bad, non? Wellllll....besides stating that he was an artist and mentioning one or two of his paintings, there was no discussion of the art scene in Paris, what his artistic process was, just, nothing. I would have loved some discussion of his art. Something to fill out this part of the storyline. 
 But I digress. Valentina meets the gorgeous and mysterious Sebastien and the two really connect. Sebastien has been emotionally closed off for many years, but finds himself falling in love with the beautiful, kind and sweet Valentina. I adore a good love triangle and I really felt tremendous sympathy for Valentina. She truly was torn between her husband and Sebastien. 
 ""One day you're going to stop running away from me. And when that day finally comes, I'll be here waiting for you,"" he whispers softly, his words a caress. ""Now go ... before I change my mind and decide it doesn't please me to share you with others after all."" 
 There were some minor inconsistencies in the story but overall I loved the book until the last part. The plot just descended for me into soap-opera territory and was reminiscent of a favorite movie of mine - but it just didn't work for me here. Fans of Mia Asher will love this book, it just was not a favorite of mine. I will always read what Mia writes and eagerly look forward to her next books!

 ""No rules. Live out loud. Find the sunshine."" 
 Simply stunning!! Emma Scott writes THE most lyrical and gorgeous fiction. Nik and Fiona have a permanent place in my heart! 
 Called a contemporary romance ""with paranormal elements,"" I found this book to be incredibly moving and very, very touching. I would not exactly characterize the story as paranormal but more the tale of a deeply empathetic man who is simply searching for love and acceptance. And please don't be put off by this being the second book in a series. I have not read the first book and I absolutely fell in love with these characters and the plot. This book is a total standalone! 
 Nik and Fiona are both lost and simply wishing for a better life. For Nik, he only wants to silence the cacophony of sounds and colors he sees and for Fiona, it is the hope of a new life in Costa Rica. And when they meet, it is pure magic. 
 ""But it wasn't what was wrong with me, anymore. It was what was right. The girl exuded a calm that danced along my skin, and when I inhaled, it was like breathing in the scent of something delicious but far away. The thrumming life all around me grew quiet. For the first time, I felt close to peace, and I wanted more."" 
 What begins as a one-night stand with zero expectations for the future turns into a burning hot love and a deep, unbreakable connection. Emma Scott's love scenes are beautiful and SEXY and a joy to read! 
 ""Nikolai Alexei,"" she whispered and cupped my cheeks to look at me in the dimness. ""Who are you?"" 
 There are very important messages in this book as well as some very gritty and heartbreaking scenes. But ultimately the message is one of hope and acceptance and unconditional love. Once again, I won't soon forget the characters created by Emma Scott. A must-read! 
 ""Love and hope,"" she said. ""That's life to me.""

 ""You know your reputation is just what everyone else thinks of you, your character is what you really are."" 
 Run, don't walk, to read this fantastic sports romance!! I am officially in love with Mariana Zapata's writing. This is my second book by this fantastic author and I am currently reading The Wall of Winnipeg and Me. I can't get enough!! 
 I adore her strong heroines. Sal is a star soccer player in her Texas hometown. She's driven, focused and yes, a little socially awkward. She is absolutely shocked when she learns that her childhood idol, the superstar Reiner Kulti, is going to be one of her team's assistant coaches. 
 I just sat there with the phone still to my face, lying in my bed two hundred miles away from where I'd grown up, soaking in the idea that Reiner Kulti--the Reiner Kulti-- was going to be my coach. I swallowed the nerves and anticipation down. No big deal. Right. 
 Oh, and she also was sure that one day, she and Kulti would be married. She worshipped him until the cold reality of the sport brought her idol down a notch or ten and her dreams of a happily ever after were destroyed. Sal tries to hold it together and play it cool when Kulti arrives but she is starstruck just like everyone else. 
 To my absolute horror, my inner thirteen-year-old, the one that had planned on marrying this guy and having soccer-playing super-babies with him, peeked in and reminded me she'd been around once. 
 Kulti makes no friends when he joins the coaching staff. He is surly, silent and downright mean to everyone, players and fans alike. But Sal keeps reminded herself that he is human, just like everyone else, no better and no worse, and gradually, they reach a truce and an understanding. They actually become friends, with Kulti confiding in Sal that he doesn't trust anyone but he sees a real goodness and honesty in Sal. 
 This book is a fantastic, enjoyable, slow-burn romance that had me literally staying up all night to finish. There is just something about Mariana Zapata's writing that is insanely addictive and completely REAL. My heart literally burst with emotion and I fell in love with Kulti. BUT do not expect instal-love here. In fact I wasn't even sure the main characters were ever going to have a civil conversation, let alone fall in love!! 
 ""I used to have a huge crush on you."" 
 The German blinked at me and I had to fight the urge to twitch -- that would just make me look like I had something to hide. Which I did, but it wasn't like I wanted him to know that once upon a time there'd been posters of him all over my wall. Or that 'Sal loves Kulti' had been written in marker on every single notebook and folder I owned in middle school. 
 ""Used to. Used. To. I was a little kid back then."" 
 Kulti seems hostile to everyone, including Sal. She slowly realizes that having worldwide fame and fortune might not be all that it's cracked up to be and that Kulti really can't lead a 'normal' life. Slowly Sal and Kulti become friends which poses a huge problem since he is one of the coaching staff. But the lines become blurred because Sal still has a huge crush on the very intimidating German. 
 I'm not going to lie, not even a little bit. Besides a big butt, I had a thing for guys that spoke different languages. While Reiner Kulti was every bit as impressive of a male specimen as you could get physically, the way he spoke Spanish multiplied his attractiveness by about thirty percent. Okay, thirty percent minimum. But it wasn't like I could or would think about that too much. He was my coach. And I was his friend. Or something like that. 
 This book is funny, sexy, romantic, exciting, action-packed...need I say more? Even if you are not a fan of sports romance, you will fall in love with Kulti. The author either really knows the sport of soccer (or football depending on your country) or she did some phenomenal research. The story was a pure delight from beginning to end. The last 20% of the book had me in tears!! I cannot recommend Kulti highly enough!! Mariana Zapata can do no wrong in my eyes. Kulti and Sal share a deep connection and a beautiful love story. This book is a must-read!

 LOVE LOVE LOVE this series! While not a standalone, 'American Prince' is just as magical and enticing as the first book. Without giving too much away, this book is Embry's story. Bad-boy Embry, who grows up to become the Vice-President of the United States. But he has always felt unworthy, of love, friendship and trust. 
 ""I grew up around power, around the kind of people who exercised authority with effortless ease, but I myself had spent most of my life dodging any and all responsibility. Consequences were something to be charmed and flirted out of, other people were worth only how much fun they could give me. I had next to no practice taking care of other people...I could barely keep myself out of trouble."" 
 Poor Embry! He is selfless and misunderstood. I devoured this book and love how Sierra Simone reveals the real reasons why Embry acts the way he does. I loved reading his point of view of his relationship with Ash and with Greer. Yet another book by Ms. Simone that I could NOT put down! 
 ""And if I ever thought Ash held all the power in their relationship, I see it clearly now. Embry holds my husband's heart in his hands and he doesn't even know it. He's too busy looking at the details of Ash's faces to see the expression, too busy being in love to see how loved he is."" 
 One of the things I love about this series is that there is no judgment from the author about the characters' choices or their lifestyle. They are just themselves. Always honest with other and always loving. Ms. Simone's great care in creating these characters is evident. This book ends on a cliffhanger but the final book will be released very soon so there's plenty of time to read this series before 'American King' comes out. This series is totally engaging and entertaining and I highly recommend it!! 
 ""I'm done running from you,"" I said honestly. ""I tried and it didn't matter--you haunted me everywhere I went."" 
 ""And you haunted me,"" he murmured, rolling over to press his lips against mine once more. ""My little prince.""

 What a perfect book to read during eclipse week 2017!! This taut and fast-paced thriller kept me on my toes until the very end. And what an ending! Kit and Laura are a young married couple who chase eclipses all over the world. It is an exciting, exotic lifestyle, hypnotic and mysterious all at once. 
 ""Then the darkness comes. Without the countdown in the sky, it's pure and instant. All the street lights in the town below come on, so quickly it's like sparks igniting. Now, in the darkness, disappointment is replaced by the familiar thrill of totality. But this time it's different."" 
 The book begins in 2015 with Laura's point of view. She lives in London but she and her husband live anonymously. Why? The answer to that question unfolds slowly over the course of the book. We learn that Laura and Kit witnessed an violent assault during an eclipse festival years earlier and were witnesses for the prosecution during the trial of the attacker, Jamie. The trial was emotionally draining and physically exhausting for everyone and is described in minute detail. 
 The brutal assault is also described in vivid detail so I was curious as to how any doubt could arise about Jamie's guilt or innocence. Just remember: there are many sides to each story. 
 ""The moment you think about an act in terms of how, you are already halfway to doing it."" 
 We learn that Laura is now pregnant with twins but wants Kit to ""chase"" an upcoming eclipse while she stays behind in London, even though she is extremely paranoid about his travels. He has been an eclipse chaser since he was young and they both want to continue their adventures after their children are born. 
 They live in fear that Beth, the young woman who had been raped years before, will find them again. She had befriended them after the trial of her attacker, but then became wildly unstable. Laura and Kit became convinced they had to disappear ""off the grid"" so that she would never find them again. 
 This book was incredibly gripping and thought-provoking. It is told over the course of many years and features vivid characters and brilliantly-researched settings. The author forces the reader to confront their own morals and ask: What would you do in the same situation? 
 ""Until that day I'd been thinking about the campaign in binary terms: either Jamie was in denial, or he was calling the world's bluff. But now a third possibility was inescapable, and one in which I was horrifically culpable. What if Jamie was innocent?"" 
 This book was addictive and wildly surprising. The references to eclipses are fascinating and the format of the book is divided into the parts of an eclipse. With my husband and daughter away ""eclipse chasing"" while I was reading this book, the subject matter was even more compelling! With themes of loyalty, guilt and devotion, this book really did it for me.

 This is my second 1001 Dark nights novella and I really like this concept. Many of my favorite authors have written a novella in this format and so far, I have enjoyed the stories. Although 'Sweet Rivalry' is a standalone, Ryder first appeared in 'Sweet Cheeks' as Saylor's brother. This novella is a steamy, sweet and fast-paced romance that you can devour in one sitting. This short story is perfect for fans of Kristy Bromberg's steamy yet witty writing style. 
 Ryder and his competitor Harper are bidding on a major construction project. They first met up during their college days and she has always been the best at everything. But Ryder is determined to win this time. Of course, they have some major chemistry, but business is business, right? 
 ""Beard burn is a real thing. 
 And oh my God it is everything I wanted it to be and then some. "" 
 I always love the strong heroines in Kristy Bromberg's books. That is one of my favorites things about her writing. No wallflowers here! If you are looking for a fast, sexy, witty read with a guaranteed happy ending, then 'Sweet Rivalry' is just the ticket. My one complaint? That this story wasn't longer! Maybe we will get a full-length book about these two someday!

 Romance lovers, rejoice and meet your next book boyfriend, Gabriel Dalton! 
 ""You can't fix me you know..."" 
 Mia Sheridan really knows how to create characters who have damaged souls and rough beginnings. People who are bullied, shunned and shut out from normal human interaction and love. And she's done it again with 'Most of All You.' Gabriel and Crystal's story is a rough journey and uncomfortable in parts, but so beautiful and uplifting that it is well worth the journey. 
 ""He needed someone warm and caring. Someone who would nurture him and piece back together the broken parts. Someone who would look in his eyes and be his calming spirit. I was not that girl... 
 This is in the end a totally swoon-y contemporary romance that has just the right amount of gritty reality to keep the story interesting. The main characters have both experienced deep heartache and childhood trauma that would break an ordinary person. Although this is most definitely a love story, the lovely way that Mia Sheridan treats Gabriel and Crystal's new and fragile friendship is the center and heart of the story. Books like this are why I read contemporary romance. Passion, honesty, damaged people simply searching for ordinary kindness - this book has it all. 
 ""I was spellbound, caught once again in his gaze. No one has ever looked at me the way Gabriel was right then, not in all my life."" 
 While the more sinister elements of the plot are not detailed at length, there is enough revealed about both characters' pasts that explains why they act the way they do and the lives they currently lead. Gabriel is such a beautiful person that my heart ached for him throughout the book. 
 ""Choice is such a loaded word, isn't it? Choices, though our own, were so weighted down with all the things that had come before, so stained with the messes of our past."" 
 This is a slow-burn romance but Gabriel and Crystal's story is SO worth the wait! Insta-love would NOT have worked here and I'm glad Mia Sheridan did not give into that often-used trope. Both main characters needed time to overcome their emotional barriers. And it felt oh so sweet when they finally come together. 
 ""I wasn't a victim. I was a survivor..."" 
 Mia Sheridan never fails to entice her readers. This is a heartfelt, sweet and very story and perfect for any romance reader. There is not too much darkness (I don't want to give too much away about the plot) but just enough to add drama and tension to the story. I guarantee you will fall in love with Gabriel Dalton!

 The title pretty much tells you what this book is all about. Chase is, well, a hot cop. 
 ""There's always a woman waiting in the wings for a hot cop like him. A flock of them, even. In a place like Kansas, he's the closest thing we have to a rock star."" 
 Livia is a librarian who is approaching 30. She wants children but not a relationship. So Chase agrees to be a sperm donor with no strings attached. That's pretty much it. What I liked about this story was the well-developed characters and the funny banter. And the ""Kelley Trio"" - yes, Officer Kelley! 
 Livia and Chase are insanely attracted to each other but both are extremely gun-shy about permanent relationships but they sure have loads of fun trying to make a baby!

 What a gorgeous book!! Emma Scott has a way of writing that is so beautiful, it is almost painful. But she also makes her characters seem real, very human, funny, flawed and just very authentic. 
 Zelda finds herself all alone in New York City, having been robbed and left with nowhere to stay, She came to New York to try and see her graphic novel but is rejected and told to revise her project to give it ""more heart."" She and Beckett meet by chance and I am not sure I have ever encountered two lonelier people than these two. 
 ""One person alone against winter was rough. But two people, together... Together. A word I never used."" 
 Beckett and Zelda both have heartbreaking pasts. They both can't seem to move on but Beckett takes a chance on Zelda and lets her stay with him in his tiny apartment, temporarily and just as roommates. Slowly, they begin to realize that they care for each other but neither of them think they truly deserve happiness. This is a slow-build romance and the author takes care in creating a connection between the two main characters. I could feel them falling in love and was literally sobbing at the end. It is hard to explain when a book has that certain spark that makes it memorable but whatever it is, The Butterfly Project has it all. The writing is beautiful and there is plenty of steam but it is believable and very explosive when Beckett and Zelda finally get together. 
 ""...I realized you could get used to anything--even being alone for years -- right until the moment you touched something better than what you had."" 
 A very sexy and emotional story, The Butterfly Project is one of my favorite books. It is a powerful tale of love and forgiveness. And the ""extras"" in this book are absolutely fantastic! All the stars to Emma Scott for this gorgeous story.

 What a beautiful, gripping and intense story! I jumped into 'Preston's Honor' without knowing too much about the plot. There is so much to love about this book: second-chance love, burning passion, forgiveness and compassion. Lia, Preston and his brother Cole all grew up together in rural California. Lia's mother was a migrant farm worker and Lia always felt the pain of poverty and the sting of feeling not good enough. Not only did she have to endure teasing and bullying at school, her mother was also cold and unfeeling towards her.

 My heart!! Both brothers loved Lia, but through a series of events, it is Cole who begins to date Lia. Life happens, Preston and Cole leave for college and Lia is left behind in the small farming town. There are no opportunities for her to continue her education, and she is resigned to accept her lot in life. I absolutely love how the author sheds light on the conditions and the plight of our nation's migrant farm workers. Lia does her best but ends up working for minimum wage in order to support herself and her mother. 
 The only bright spot in her life is Preston. She is overjoyed when he returns to town. Bound together by a tragedy, it is difficult to know whether their love will survive. 
 ""Annalia. Christ. Seeing her again had been simultaneously torturous and joyful. I gripped the hair at my forehead, a sound of frustration coming up my throat. Hadn't that always been the case? Only this time . . . this time the shock of seeing her as a woman had nearly stopped my heart. I'd felt . . . breathless. Struck mute. Consumed."" 
 Will Preston and Lia be able to find happiness? Things really do seem hopeless for them and there is much heartache and misunderstandings between them. Lia was a lovely, honest, caring and gorgeous character (inside and out) and Preston was magnificent. My heart almost stopped several times while reading this passionate story! I was desperate for these two to find happiness. 
 ""Thank you, Preston."" For being my friend once, for giving me my first dance, for watching over me. It was all I had. It would have to be enough. 
 Once again, Mia Sheridan does not disappoint. I highly recommend this beautiful tale of second chances, redemption and mercy. And the Prologue was a stunner!! Happy tears were flowing all around.

 The second book of the Endgame series begins right were 'The Pawn' ended. Avery has really hit rock bottom. She is living in a rundown motel and has lost everything. But she is determined to get back what is precious to her and 'The Knight' is another deliciously dark romance that features some great characters and writing. 
 Gabriel really cares for Avery. He is outwardly cruel but their scenes together are everything I love about Skye Warren's writing. He was almost brutally cruel in the first book but here, he seems to finally show his true feelings. But Avery wants nothing more then to get revenge on the man she believes led to her father's downfall. Make no mistake, Gabriel Miller is still a harsh and brutal figure, and he still remains mysterious. 
 I love the supporting characters in this book and would love to read more about Avery's mother! The circumstances surrounding her death become more and more mysterious and I hope that the third book in this series tells more of her story. 'The Knight' ends on a surprising note and I can't wait to read 'The Castle,' the third book in this series. 
 Skye Warren once again delivers the goods in this story. This series is dark, very sensual and dangerous.

 Sometimes you need a good old-fashioned romance to lose yourself in and Egomaniac is just the book! Vi Keeland once again shows her talent for writing a funny, sexy, tender-hearted romance that is creative, engaging and sweet. 
 I enjoyed every minute of this book. Emerie and Drew ""meet cute"" and I was drawn in from the very beginning. What separates Vi Keeland's romances from the rest of the books out there is the heated chemistry between her characters and their wonderful banter. Emerie is new in town and winds up renting space from Drew, an aggressive divorce attorney. He is a commitment-phobe, for very good reason. I loved the way the author slowly revealed his history and I absolutely adored his POV!! This book is literally laugh-out-loud funny. 
 ""And I suppose all of your women are fast asleep after you take care of them."" 
 ""Damn straight. I'm like a superhero. The Prolactinator."" 
 Egomaniac is a super-sexy, very fast-paced read that has lots of warmth and heart. It is witty and smart and very addicting. I loved all of the secondary characters and I hope that at least one of them is getting their own story soon! I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading many more stories from this very talented author.

This house might be simple, but it's ambition is extraordinary."" 
 A fantastic psychological thriller that I could not put down!! Would you be willing to give up almost all of your worldly possessions for a chance live in a stunning home for very little rent? That is the fascinating premise of this book by JP Delaney, a pseudonym for a well-known writer. I read that the author did not want to reveal his/her gender because the book is told from a female point of view. I did not know this when I first read a sample, and the author succeeded in making me feel as though I was inside the narrators' minds. 
 The brilliant architect Edward Monkford has designed One Folgate Street in London, a high-tech house with cutting edge design. Edward is a follower of minimalism to the extreme, so much so that the tenants must agree to abide by his extreme de-cluttering rules and regulations. But he sees his rules as so much more than control and firmly believes that a house really can change you from within. If you have to de-clutter your life, then you will begin to see what is truly important in life, and you will free your mind to become a better person. 
 Emma and Jane are both looking for a fresh start. They are required to fill out a stringent and lengthy application in order to pass on to the final level of approval, which is a very brief meeting with the owner and designer of One Folgate Street. The rent is low and the house is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. 
 Edward is difficult, mysterious, brilliant, moody...but the chance to live in the magnificent home is so tempting, the women overlook all of this in order for a chance to live at One Folgate Street. The home is equipped with the latest high-tech gadgets, and the tenants must answer periodic questionnaires in order to continue living in the house. The evaluations test their ethics, their physical well-being and their state of mind and are quite literally crucial to continues living in the house. 
 ""That's all anyone's looking for really, isn't it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?"" 
 The descriptions of the home are absolutely enthralling. I am still thinking about this book weeks after finishing! The idea of extreme de-cluttering is very thought-provoking and is woven inextricably into this intriguing story. Is Edward as dangerous and unhinged as everyone seems to think he is? This is a classic tale where NOTHING is as it seems. I literally read this book over the course of 2 days and was shocked by the surprising conclusion. 
 The story is told from the point of view of Emma, who is seeking a safe neighborhood and a secure home after a recent break-in, and Jane, who has suffered a tragic loss and is seeking a new beginning. Their stories converge in a creative way and I loved how the author kept me guessing until the very last page. The house literally plays a central role in this book and to me is one of the main characters in this story. If you are looking for a thrilling read that will challenge you and your boundaries, then ""The Girl Before' is for you!! I LOVED it and highly recommend it for all fans of domestic thrillers.

 'Bombshell' was not quite for me, but was an engaging and verrrry sexy romance. I adore C.D. Reiss's writing and I know that not every book is for every reader. SO, although I love her trademark staccato-style of writing, it just didn't work for me here. This book seemed to be written more in the style of a screenplay, which is fine, but the rapid shifting between dialogue and settings was disorienting for me. 
 I didn't really connect with the MC's until late in the book and I wanted to feel a connection not only TO them, but BETWEEN them. And the near-constant discussion of bodily functions was just very uninteresting to me. Would this make a cute movie? Absolutely. It just didn't work for me as a romance novel. 
 The stereotyping of wealthy Hollywood insiders and the way they raise their children and constantly chase after their staff was also very uninteresting to me. I did enjoy the latter half of the book and loved the way Brad grew as a person and as a new father to Nicole. I am definitely in the minority on this book so by all means give this one a try if you love books about single dads and Hollywood superstars. C.D. Reiss continues to be one of my favorite romance authors and I will always read what this woman writes!

 ""If you can't trust yourself, who can you trust?"" 
 OMG!! Intelligent and thrilling page-turner that I read in almost one sitting! The rather abrupt ending was a little unsatisfying BUT the clever story kept me guessing. 
 I think most people do something or fail to take action that may cause some guilt. Well this story begins with Cass taking a shortcut late at night and failing to stop and help a woman who is stopped on the side of the road. 
 The motorist ends up dead. Cass feels guilty, but just as significant are the little things she begins to forget...how to run the washing machine, making dinner plans with friends, and even rather significant purchases. Her mother suffered from early-onset Alzheimer's. What is happening to Cass? 
 Cass's mental well-being soon spirals out of control and she fears she will suffer the same fate as her mother. 
 I literally could not put this book down! I FELT Cass's hysteria and fear. The last part of the book was thrilling and surprising and gave me everything I love about thrillers. I highly recommend this one for all fans of this genre and even if you want to step outside your usual genre. Cass was a memorable heroine and I was cheering for her all throughout the book. This is my first book by B.A. Paris and she has now become one of my faves!!

 Penelope Ward is an auto-buy author for me. Hands down, her second-chance romances are among my absolute favorite stories! Her main characters always have tons of heart, soul and chemistry, And humor! And I adore the catchy title of this book. 
 Mack is devoted to his young son Johan who he enrolled in Frankie's class in Boston. Mack has broken up with his son's mother, with whom he had a long-term relationship. Mack and Frankie were roommates years before, with Frankie losing her heart completely to Mack. But they were not meant to be, and went their separate ways. 
 Now Mack has shown up, determined to win Frankie back. She is the love of his life. The problem is that she now is living with her current boyfriend, an older, very stable college professor who adores her. What will Frankie do? Told in alternating POV's, we read how Mack and Frankie's love blossomed several years before. They are simply meant to be. 
 ""Remember all those things you wished I could do to you? I'm about to make all your wishes come true if you let me."" 
 All the moms in school pursue Mack who is the resident DILF. Penelope Ward is seriously FUNNY and there are some hilarious moments in this book! But at its heart it is a gorgeous second-chance romance as only Ms. Ward can write. 
 Mack Daddy is SERIOUSLY sexy and sizzling hot. I adored the supporting cast of characters and I fell in love with Mack's son Jonah. I also adored Frankie's boyfriend and felt very sad when she had to make her choice between Mack, the love of her life, and her current boyfriend. Ms. Ward handles this situation with grace and sensitivity. This book is warm and sweet and sexy all at once. Overall a lovely, emotional and sexxxxxy story with lots of heat and heart!!

And I do love books about marriage. Separation Games was a perfect conclusion to the first book in this series. Marriage Games ended with an unusual twist and I absolutely loved how the author worked things out between Adam and Diana. I feel both of their pain, confusion and longing. 
 And Adam, OMG! He was one of the author's most memorable heroes. Wow. Both Diana and Adam are mature, smart and very driven. This book is off-the-charts sexy and is the perfect read for fans of mature contemporary romance with an erotic twist. 
 ""Beg to come.""

 ""Beg harder."" 
 Adam and Diana do not have a easy path but when they do finally resolve their issues, it is explosive. I have never read a book by CD Reiss that I didn't love, and this duet is no exception. The supporting characters are all very well-written and the New York City setting adds another exciting layer to the story. The Epilogue is fantastic! I was actually sorry to see this story end.

 The first part of the book begins in college with Sabrina falling for the bad boy Donovan. I will admit that the beginning of this book, which was released as a separate novella, did not really hold my interest. But when the book fast-forwards 10 years and Sabrina has moved to New York, WOW!! The Laurelin Paige that I know and love returned with a bang. 
 Sabrina is hired to work at the company run by Donovan and Weston. She is smart, driven and extremely competent. But yet she is still in many ways the insecure college student who felt out of her league with wealthy men like Donovan and Weston. 
 This book is EXTREMELY explicit and explores the taboo subject of rape fantasies. So if that is not your thing, then you will not like this story. But if you are a fan of rollercoaster emotions, then you will love this book. 
 Sabrina has always been obsessed with Donovan. But he is distant, cold, sarcastic. She and Weston have a fling, but she realizes that she still has deep feelings for Donovan, and cannot resist his allure. 
 ""I don't want you to touch me like Weston,"" I said, once and for all. ""I don't want Weston! I want you!"" 
 Donovan let loose the smallest hint of a smile. ""I know. I was waiting for you to know too."" 
 Sabrina goes back and forth with her feelings for Donovan. He was downright cold to her BUT he is so hot, she cannot stay away. I felt that this book really picked up around the 40% mark and I would urge everyone to give this thrilling and extremely sexy story a try. 
 Why the 4 stars? I loved the absolutely electrifying chemistry between Sabrina and Donovan. The sexy times are off the charts. I did not love Sabrina's lack of self-esteem and her feelings of worthlessness. I hope in the next book she goes after what she wants. I found this book to be very engrossing, surprising and very, very adult. So that for me is a win. 
 I love these kind of books where the hero is damaged and unloveable yet becomes obsessed with the heroine. I hope we get Donovan's POV in the next book and I cannot wait for the conclusion to Sabrina and Donovan's story!! 
 ""Were you even going to say goodbye?"" I asked, pretending to balance accusation with acceptance when really I was hoping he'd say he'd changed his mind about going at all. 
 He smiled lazily. ""I don't know what you mean. I'm still here."" 
 ""You're just as much already gone."" 
 His face was in the shadows, but I could feel his expression sober even if I couldn't see it. ""I'm less gone than you'd imagine.""

 Mariana Zapata, where have you been all my life!? 'Wait for It' was completely engrossing; a slow-burn romance that really ignited my passion for reading again. And now I must decide which one of her books to read next! This was my first book by this amazing author, and I absolutely adored every single word of this incredible story! 
 'Wait for It' is not a predictable story. It is a solid, real, passionate romance, filled with heart and humor and heart-stopping love. Diana is single and raising two young boys. She is independent, funny, hard-working and definitely NOT looking for romance. 
 She meets her new neighbor Dallas in a very unconventional way, and they actually get off to a very rocky start. Dallas is stern, uptight and seems to not like Diana very much AT ALL. 
 What were you supposed to do when someone didn't want to be your friend or at least be friendly, and you'd tried your best? I thought I'd been a pretty good person. A pretty good neighbor. I hadn't done anything to make him feel uncomfortable. At least, I genuinely didn't think I had. 
 Diana oh-so-slowly begins to realize what kind of man Dallas really is when he becomes the coach of her young boy's baseball team. Between baseball and being neighbors, Dallas begins to form a bond with Diana and her family that biomes the real backbone of this story. 
 He has a soft spot for single moms. You are no one special, Diana, I reminded myself. You are no one special. 
 Mariana Zapata's writing is so unique and fresh that I am going to pick up one of her other books next. I could not get enough of Dallas and Diana! The dialogue was snappy and felt SO real. The character development was strong and the romance unfolded perfectly. No insta-love here, folks. This couple built a solid foundation so that when they eventually got together, it was simply beautiful. 
 'Wait for It"" was the kind of book that I simply could not wait to get back to. Isn't that the best kind of story? If you are looking for a passionate story about two grown-ups who have lived and loved and lost, then pick up this book. It is gorgeous.

Joanna Wylde's writing is smart, funny and sexy. I love how Shade goes after Mandy but only claims her when he's sure she's in it all the way. Mandy's had her eye on Shade but didn't make a move because she already had a boyfriend, who was a total loser. 
 ""When I first met Rebel, I'd teased him about having a crush on Shade because my new boyfriend couldn't stop talking about the man. Then I'd met Shade in person. Now I got it. Rebel worked hard to make sure everyone knew he was a big, bad biker. Shade didn't have to work at it. He just was big and bad."" 
 Joanna Wylde's MC books are among my favorite stories and this story reminded me why I love her so much. Her women are strong, resilient and tough as nails. Not to mention down-to-earth and self-deprecating. Mandy can't resist the allure of Shade, the President of the Reaper's MC, even though she is conned into being alone with him for the first time. 
 ""He was the biggest, nastiest bastard in the room--not to mention easy on the eyes--and deep down inside I just knew we'd make beautiful babies together. Too bad I already sort of had a boyfriend... Shade was so potent we'd probably have quintuplets or something crazy on the first try. You don't even want a baby, I reminded my quivering ovaries. Jump him! Jump him and ride him like a cowgirl! they snapped back. Just think how sexy and strong he is. His sperm could kick Rebel's ass and you know it!"" 
 Shade is NOT looking for an ""old lady,"" or even anything more than a one night stand. He makes this very clear to Mandy. Which is fine with her, because she has had nothing but rotten luck with her previous boyfriends. 
 ""Girls wanted flowers and roses and forever. I wanted the road under my tires and something new on the horizon. Never understood why so many of my brothers were willing to settle down in one place. I wasn't that guy. Never had been. Never would be."" 
 There's lots of action and lots of steamy, dirty scenes and just lots of fun in this story. I adore Joanna Wylde and this story satisfied my craving for her MC stories.

 This is a dirty, dirty book and LOTS of fun. Even if you don't usually read sports romance, give Hail Mary a try! You will love this very spicy and very funny story. I loved that Jimmy and Mary were mature adults, with families, jobs, friends and very full lives. Jimmy had a sweet side and Mary was absolutely lovable and perfectly relatable. Yes, there is a touch if insta-love but it worked perfectly in this story. And the Chicago setting was fantastic. 
 Hail Mary was a well-written, engaging, romantic and hilarious story with maybe THE sexiest scene I have read this year. There, I said it. Hello, champagne bottle! *Fans self* I truly loved this book and love this author's fresh writing style. What detracted from the story for me was the unprotected sex when Jimmy and Mary hardly knew each other (sorry, a big turn-off for me). I also found it a little unbelievable that Mary had no clue who Jimmy was, when they both lived in the same city where he was a famous football star. But, other readers didn't seem to mind so read this little gem of a story and judge for yourself! It's got plenty of heat and humor to please even the most jaded romance reader. I can't wait to see what's coming up next for this wonderful new author! 
 ""Yeah? You think so? You think you can handle me?""

 Another sexy, modern contemporary romance from Katy Evans! Very enjoyable with a very relatable heroine. And Callan!! WOW!! 
 A very fast-paced and super-sexy story, 'Womanizer' takes place in Chicago and follows Olivia, a young intern at a hugely successful company owned by Callan Carmichael. Part of the Manwhore series, this book can absolutely stand on its own but favorite characters from the earlier books do make appearances here. Olivia is starting a new internship at Carma, Inc. and is determined to make a name for herself at the company. Even though her brother Tahoe helped her get the job, she is very driven and wants to make a great impression. 
 Callan and Olivia fall for each other very quickly, and even though they both know their relationship can't really go anywhere because of the nature of their working relationship, they feel an undeniable connection. Their dialogue and flirting is sexy and fun and Olivia doesn't expect them to last beyond the length of her summer internship. 
 Lots of readers will love 'Womanizer' for the main characters' chemistry, the settings and the feisty heroine. I enjoyed it as light and steamy story. If you are looking for a quick and upbeat romance with a super-hot hero, I would recommend this book. I loved the Chicago setting and smart heroine. The Epilogue was absolutely fantastic!

 What a beautiful journey! 'Mists of the Serengeti' is a lush story set against the harsh reality of the wilds of Africa. Ro and Jack are brought together by a terrible tragedy. Jack has been left bitter and empty; Ro is grief-stricken but still has the ability to laugh and relate to other human beings. I will admit I was a little reluctant to dive into this story, knowing it begins with a horrible event but I was immediately and completely captivated by these characters. 
 ""I caught a glimpse of his soul. So many pieces of him had been fed to the lions. And as dark and bitter as it had turned him, he was a gladiator for standing where I would have surely fallen.""

I was literally lost in the pages of this story! Leylah Attar remains one of my favorite writers and I have devoured everything she has written. 'Mists of the Serengeti' is a gorgeous and uplifting story filled with romance, love, life and tears. Don't miss it!!

 An intelligent, twisty psychological thriller that kept me up all night! I'll try not to reveal too much about the plot because it is a shocker! Zoe is a stunning Manhattan socialite, living in a world of charity dinners, beautiful apartments and gorgeous vacation homes. She has everything she could want at her fingertips: a designer wardrobe, a private cook and romantic getaways with her perfect husband, Henry. 
 ""I stop protesting his indulgence, when he buys me clothing and shoes and jewelry. I stop looking for the catch. There doesn't seem to be one. So what do you do?"" 
 But right from the beginning, there are cracks in Zoe's perfect life, and we don't know whether it is from her damaged past or from someone or something in her current life. She is growing bored as Henry's wife, and longs for her younger self, when she had a job, friends and freedom to do whatever she wanted. She begins to chafe in her perfect little bubble. 
 ""I can prepare dinner and I have on occasion, but he always insists we ask Penny, which irritates me. I have all day in this echoing apartment, my own voice bouncing off the sterile, bare walls and marble floors. Sometimes I wonder if uselessness can kill a person."" 
 Zoe is witty, sarcastic and smart, and all of the characters were engaging and interesting. I loved her connection with Henry, and even though she was in love with him, she never quite felt that she really ""knew"" him at all. 
 ""Henry is a product of a traditional household and paternalism runs deep in his veins, which I find both charming and a little infuriating, depending on the day."" 
 But is Zoe just imagining things where they do not exist? Henry is the perfect husband and all he wants to do is please her. The author did a great job at creating characters I really cared about. With all his odd mannerisms, Henry seems to be in love with his wife and do everything for her. After a charity event, Zoe begins to question her past and seeks out certain people that she had thought were long gone from her life. I don't want to give anything away because this book is full of surprises and fantastic twists and turns. I absolutely loved Zoe's slow awakening from a bored housewife to a woman with a purpose. The author kept me guessing for the whole book! 
 'The Vanishing Year' has been called a ""domestic thriller"". This is a perfect description. It is an edgy, sexy, exciting story that kept me guessing until the very end. The little clues sprinkled here and there, the red herrings, the gorgeous Henry all added up to the perfect thriller for me! Don't miss this one. I can't wait to read more books by the amazing Kate Moretti.

 ""I'm good at being what people want me to be. Watch me . . . You'll see."" 
 In this smart and very engaging mystery, we're treated to three different perspectives on a crime that occurs very early on in the book. Hattie is a good girl, having grown up in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. She aches to break free and move to New York City after high school. Hattie is the perfect daughter, student, girlfriend and friend. 
 But Hattie has a secret life, one that threatens the delicate balance of her small Minnesota farming town. She is merely pretending, acting a role, when the ""real"" Hattie is far from perfect. Her actions will affect and change many people's lives forever. Peter is her high school English teacher who feels trapped in a loveless marriage. And Del is the lead investigator on Hattie's brutal murder. His voice lends a dry wit and careful reason to the series of events unfolding around him. Can he be neutral when the families he has known his whole life are brutally affected by this unspeakable crime? 
 ""Mom warned me that I had a lot to learn about the world. I wished she would've mentioned how much the learning was going to hurt."" 
 I was enthralled by this deeply moving thriller! The small-town atmosphere is perfectly captured by the author. Every characters is flawed, some more so than others. I never saw the ending coming. This book was fast-paced, smart and engaging. Don't be put off by the endless comparisons to other best-sellers in this genre. 'Everything You Want Me to Be' stands on its own as a poignant and suspenseful story. Highly recommended for all fans of psychological thrillers and murder mysteries!

 Skye Warren is one of my go-to dark romance authors. Her books never fail to enthrall, entertain and excite. 'The Pawn' is trademark Skye Warren: a sheltered, innocent young woman, smart but faced with almost insurmountable odds against her, and a dark hero, who seems unbearably cruel but who might just have a soft side. 
 Avery's whole world has collapsed and she faces loses her family's home. Her father is dying and she has nowhere to turn. She agrees to an auction, which goes against everything she believes in. Enter Gabriel Miller, dangerous, handsome and ruthless. Even though he was the cause of her family's downfall, can he possibly be her savior? 
 He steps back with a quiet laugh. ""You can run away, little virgin. But you'll come back."" I'm very afraid he's right. 
 Avery is afraid to trust Gabriel but she has nowhere else to turn. Gabriel turns out to be sensual and protective but even more mysterious than Avery first thought. He is her father's enemy but he can't stay away from Avery. 
 ""What am I then?"" 
 ""You're innocent. And I'm going to ruin you."" 
 The certainty in his voice chills me. 
 I devoured this dark and sexy book in one sitting. Skye Warren is the BEST at writing uber-sexy, controlling men and Gabriel Miller is one I won't forget! 'The Pawn' is a fast-paced tale of revenge and control, perfect for lovers of dark romance. Avery and Gabriel are perfect together and I was thrilled to have the second book to start immediately after finishing! 
 You can have my body, I think. But you can't touch my heart.

 Prince Nicholas is the heir to the throne in a fictional country. This story is a pure fairytale, down to the names of some of the characters to the plot. Poor Nicholas has followed the rules his whole life. And now it is time for to select a wife, but only because his grandmother the Queen is forcing him to finally settle down. He can't bear the thought of it and takes off for the United States for one last ""fling"".

Do everything you wanted to do--everyone you wanted to do--for as long as you could. Until time was up. Well...looks like I've got a plan, after all."" 
 Olivia is hard-working ""commoner"" who runs her family business in New York. She is having a tough time keeping the struggling diner going. Nicholas happens to stumble into the diner after a wild night of partying and is stunned by the beautiful Olivia. 
 If Helen launched a thousand ships, this girl could raise a thousand hard-ons. 
 Of course, their relationship is NOT supposed to happen! He can't possibly fall in love with a commoner! So they agree to a brief summer fling. Olivia is not easily impressed, but even she realizes that they both live in very different worlds. 
 ...I grab his arm, shaking. ""I don't think you understand--you live in a freaking castle!"" 
 ""Technically, it's a palace. Castles were built for defense, palaces more for the monarch to hold court in appropriate grandeur."" 
 And Jesus, I want to stick my tongue down his throat. ""Have I told you how hot it is when you roll out the royal facts?"" 
 'Royally Screwed' is a very charming fairytale with a healthy does of Emma Chase's trademark spicy humor. All of the characters also seem very down-to-earth with many of the same problems and heartaches as everyone else. 
 Nicholas knows he lives in an insulated world and he does his best to keep Olivia safe. But wicked characters are lurking everywhere, in the form of the paparazzi, jealous old girlfriends and even the Queen herself. Their relationship seems doomed from the start. 
 ""It not easy being my friend; it's even more difficult being my lover. Think of me as a walking exploding bomb--anything near to me will eventually become collateral damage."" 
 What I enjoyed about this book was the witty, sexy, fast-paced dialogue and the engaging supporting characters. There's also a wonderful theme of family and duty running through this story that I really loved. 
 The author has created a very relatable fairytale that provided an escape from real life. The ending was a lovely surprise and along with Nicholas and Olivia, I adored his brother Henry. I can't wait to read his story!

'Mr. President' is a feel-good story set against the exciting backdrop of America's capitol. With the U.S. election season almost at an end, we all can use a good old-fashioned political romance! 
 Matt and Charlotte were both born into political families. Charlotte is the daughter of a senator and Matt is the son of a former U.S. president. Their futures seem pre-destined. But Charlotte is not sure what she wants to do with her life, until a promise she made as a child now comes back to life. She had promised Matt that if he ever ran for president, that she would join his campaign. Now fast-forward to the present day and a young and very promising Matt is running for president as an independent candidate. 
 He is very passionate about changing the world. Charlotte, who worked for her mother's organization assisting women in need, is totally captivated by him and can't hep but be mesmerized by him. This is a political campaign so Matt's every move is being watched. Charlotte is a campaign staffer. Will they ever be able to go public with their very passionate romance? 
 I loved that this book had a very upbeat and positive spin on American politics. Ms. Evans seems to have really done her homework on the inner workings of political campaigns and it really shows. Matt and Charlotte had amazing chemistry together, even though this story was a slow-burn romance. It does conclude on a bit of a cliffhanger but the next book in the series will be releasing very soon, in January 2017. I can't wait to see how Matt and Charlotte's romance plays out.

While I deeply cared about the MC's, some parts of the book were a bit too slow for me and the endings felt rushed. So I really liked this book a lot. I loved the creative and clever plot and was totally taken by surprise by the conclusion. I never saw that coming! 
 I felt the deep connection between the MC's and it just felt ""right"". It seems that no one cared much for Mia, so much so that no one was sure she was actually missing as opposed to just being irresponsible. Cold, her kidnapper, actually saves her life by hiding her away once he realizes that she will be useless to his boss once a ransom is collected. 
 There is much more to the story: there is the sad tale of James and Eve's marriage, the father's coldness toward Mia for most of her life, and the superstar sister who outshines Mia at every turn. The only one who seems to really care about her is her captor.

 'Four Letter Word' (clever title, no?) was everything I expect from J. Daniels: sweet and funny banter mixed with THE hottest romance and deeply-felt emotion. Brian and Sidney's story was unexpectedly dramatic but completely readable and satisfying! 
 Brian and Sidney meet by accident in the funniest way. Their surprise connection and relationship then develops via text messages and phone calls, BUT it really worked for me! Sidney is completely devastated and betrayed as the story begins, so she will she ever learn to trust another man again? Even one as ""perfect"" as Brian Savage? 
 ""I needed you, but I didn't know I needed you until you reached out to me."" 
 As with all of J. Daniels books, the hero and heroine and totally relatable and very ""real"". They have regular jobs, very good friends and and just came across as very down-to-earth. The secondary characters here were all wonderful: great supportive friends who stood by Brian and Sidney through everything! 
 Brian was a fantastic, sexy, dirty-talking Alpha with a sweet and loving and sensitive side. He and Sidney have fantastic chemistry and I was rooting for them to make things work. I absolutely loved how Brian always tried to do the right thing and be the perfect man for Sidney. He made some terrible sacrifices and poor choices BUT he completely won me over with the way he treated Sidney! 
 'She couldn't know too much. She could never know. Never. I gave her enough so I could still have her, but I took everything.' 
 'Four Letter Word' was a wonderfully paced and steamy story, perfect for when you crave a sweet and sexy contemporary romance. J. Daniels is one of my go-to romance authors, and she really delivered with Brian and Sidney's story. I cannot wait for more stories in this series!

I am in the minority on this one so read Retrieval for yourself and you might love it! I loved the scenes between Roman and Elisabeth and yes, they absolutely belong together! Their lives are intertwined with Walt and Clare. I adored Roman's sexy, uber-alpha ways. BUT there were too many inconsistencies in the story for me. The ending felt a bit rushed and I would have liked to have have spent more time with the main characters before the book ended. 
 (view spoiler)[ For example, during their separation, Roman sent Elisabeth huge company checks for several hundred thousand dollars. You can't just write a check like that without accounting for it on a balance sheet or an accrual. It's not like writing a personal check! And she never cashed them, which would also raise some accounting red flags. But, okay. (hide spoiler)]

Salsbury know that she always creates THE most sensitive, damaged and protective heroes, but trust me, Lucas is VERY different from all her other characters. 
 Lucas is trying to live a quiet and uneventful life, having lived through a terrible trauma. His daily struggles are painful and feel very real. Told in alternating POV's, the book also tells Shyann's story. She has come back home, not exactly willingly, in order to start over again while working for her dad. 'Split' is not what you'd expect from J.B. Salsbury but it is a wonderfully sensitive and VERY sexy story. With tons of suspense!

 ""Take the hoodie off. Please. I'll only look with my eyes."" 
 OMG this book was SO funny!! Sweet and sugary but sexy and romantic, too. I devoured this confection of a story. I am absolutely floored that this was a debut novel! Every line was funnier than the one before. And the story was pure enjoyment! This book was the perfect antidote for me. 
 Lucy and Josh are co-workers at a large publishing company who end up competing for the same job. I am very picky about office romances because (a) I work in an office, and (b) they are usually so unrealistic and overly simple. Not 'The Hating Game'. The author nails the workplace setting perfectly. 
 Lucy and Josh HATE each other. Like, they can't even stand to be in the same room together. But they share an office! They are complete opposites in every way. He is cold and controlling, she is warm and friendly. He is REALLY tall, she is VERY petite. They tease each other incessantly. 
 ""Stop calling me Shortcake."" 
 ""Watching you pretend to hate that nickname is the best part of my day."" 
 The writing in this book was absolutely hilarious. The dialogue was fresh and original. 
 ""I don't like big guys. They're too much like horses. They could trample you if you got underfoot. He is auditing my appearance with the same narrowed eyes that I am. I wonder what the top of my head looks like. I'm sure he only fornicates with Amazons."" 
 Lucy and Josh eventually end of competing for the same job which would mean a huge promotion for both of them. Lucy comes to realize that their mutual and VERY public dislike for each other just might actually be mutual lust. She can't help but drool over Josh's perfection every single day. 
 ""Today is a magnificent black T-shirt day. Write today in your diaries. Tell your grandchildren stories about it. I tear my eyes away, but they slide back moments later. Underneath that T-shirt is a body that could fog an elderly librarian's glasses."" 
 This book reminded me of 'Tangled' by Emma Chase. The writing is smart, sexy, funny and very sharp. Both characters here are fully developed and the secondary characters are just as interesting! I fell in love with both Lucy's and Josh's families. AND I loved the characters' growth over the course of the book. 
 ""I've got so much inside me I have no idea about. I'm like the mayor of a city I've never seen."" 
 I highly recommend this book if you are in the mood for a sweet and sexy modern romance with the perfect amount of wit and sarcasm.

Not too much angst, but plenty of steam and heart to satisfy every fan of contemporary romance. The story revolved around a sexy pilot, Carter, who embarks on a romantic and unplanned adventure with Kendall, a girl who is running from her future. 
 'Playboy Pilot' is a fast-paced, glamorous story that takes the reader to places around the world. It is a bit of escapist fantasy that is grounded in reality but is very funny, sexy, and enjoyable. 
 Kendall and Carter meet in an airport when she is trying to decide what to do with the rest of her life. Carter is sexy as hell, a gorgeous pilot, and right then Kendall makes a rash decision that will change her life. Yes, Carter has had a wild past but he is completely honest with Kendall and does not try to hide his past. This is ultimately a very sweet romance, filled with lots of heart, written in the style that I love by these two authors. You can always count on a happy ending for the MC's in Penelope and Vi's books even if their path is not so smooth getting there. Enjoy! 
 All good things must come to an end, right?

'Beautiful Bastard' was one of my earliest fanfic favorites and while I am sad that this series is ending, I thoroughly enjoyed this yummy story. 
 This is a light-hearted, upbeat and sexy book that delivers on all fronts. As with the earlier books, all of the characters are inter-connected. Jensen is Hanna's bother and Pippa is Ruby's friend. They meet in the most adorable way on an international flight but of course neither one knows the who the other is. They meet up again and of course, sparks fly. These two could not be more opposite: Pippa is breaking free from her old life and is living ""in the moment"" for the first time in her life, and Jensen is a complete workaholic. But opposites attract, right? So while on a road trip, Pippa and Jensen start a wild fling. 
 ""Your hair like this makes your eyes bluer,"" he continued, and my mind hit the brakes. ""Makes your lips pinker. Makes you look too perfect to be real."" 
 This is a fast-paced and endearing romantic comedy with an absolutely perfect Epilogue. I loved seeing the whole gang reunited again and enjoyed every minute of this book. Jensen and Pippa were fabulous together and the ending was exactly what I hoped for!

 I ADORE Renee Carlino and I think that all of her other books are beautifully written. 'Not in This Life' is one my top favorite books! 'Lucian Divine' did not have the depth that I expect from this writer's work. There was plenty of ""tell"" but not enough show. This lack of detail led to me not really feeling the bond between the main characters. 
 Without spoiling the plot, there are just too many open questions in this book. The ending felt rushed. There are elements of romance, sex and even humor here, but I never ""felt"" the love between Evey and Lucian. I like that the author wrote a story that is certainly different and unexpected. Some readers may enjoy this type of book, but it was just not for me. I loved the Epilogue and the ending for these characters was perfect. Definitely try this one and judge for yourself!

 One of Alessandra Torre's best books. Couldn't put it down!! Crisp, concise, fast-paced and enthralling. All of the ingredients for a great read! 
 ""If you lie enough times, no one believes your truth."" 
 This book is Alessandra Torre at her best: no-nonsense, smart and engaging fiction. Helena is a very unlikely heroine, prickly, moody and basically angry at the world. She doesn't want to rely on anyone at all. She even keeps her long-time agent Kate at arm's length. 
 ""On rare days, Kate regrets ever meeting the woman. But on most days, she just wonders about her. They say all geniuses are a little mad. Maybe Helena's madness just took longer to come out."" 
 But Helena as a story to tell and she doesn't have much time to do it. She sets her sights on one writer, and one writer only, to become her ghostwriter. A competing romance author, Marka writes books that Helena actually despises. But she sees a talent there that would be perfect for her own story. 
 ""What's happened to me? I have a story that I don't have time to tell. I have an empty house that reeks of death. I have no friends, no family, and no one to ask for help. I'm dying, and it's the best thing that has happened to me in a long time."" 
 Alessandra Torre builds the suspense perfectly in this book, all while holding the reader's attention and slowly revealing the terrible secret about Helena's life. This book is also a fascinating glimpse into the lonely life of a writer and the almost obsessive need to get the words out at all costs. 
 ""You can tell them who you are, or what your job in the book was. I don't mind if they know I've had help."" 
 They. The gods in their world, the eyes on which the axis rotated. The readers. The critics. What would they think? 
 This is most definitely not a romance but the main characters are both renowned romance writers. Helena's own story begins as a romance but you just know it is NOT going to conclude with a happily ever after. 
 ""Boys like him don't go for girls like me, they don't follow me with their eyes, or listen when I speak. They don't lean closer or want more."" 
 I absolutely loved this book. Once I started I could not put it down. I applaud the author for creating a heroine who is far from loveable yet completely and utterly captivating. No question that astute readers will figure out the terrible secret before the surprising conclusion, but this book is a total winner nonetheless. It is completely original and inventive. I have never read anything like it. Alessandra Torre deserves all the accolades for this one!

This fast-paced, twisty science-fiction thriller was just what I needed to get out of a reading slump! Even if you don't usually read this genre, DON'T MISS DARK MATTER! It is a brilliant romantic suspense story that had me guessing until the very end. 
 There IS a romance at the heart of this story of scientist/professor Jason Dessen, because to me, the struggle to get back to his beloved wife is what drives most of the action in this book. I went back and re-read the first chapter of this book after I finished to get a better picture of the sudden and violent kidnapping that occurs at the very beginning of this book. 
 ""My life is great. It's just not exceptional. And there was a time when it could have been."" 
 ""You killed your ambition, didn't you?"" 
 ""It died of natural causes. Of neglect."" 
 Jason is literally snatched from his current life and ends up in a place that might be a dream. He can't tell the difference between real-life and fantasy, until it slowly starts to dawn on him what is really happening to him. The author made me feel sad, nostalgic and thrilled all at once. Plus there is an ethical dilemma at the heart of this story. 
 ""I feel insanity stalking me again, threatening to curl me up fetal and shatter me into a million pieces."" 
 Dark Matter is best read without knowing any spoilers. AND I was thrilled to learn that it is going to be made into a movie!! YES!! Paging Viggo Mortensen or Michael Fassbender! This story literally had me on the edge of seat the entire time I was reading. Just when I thought I had things figured out, I was surprised and thrilled by the next turn of events. Part philosophy about what might have been, part romance, and all suspense, Dark Matter is a book I won't soon forget. 
 ""It's the beautiful thing about youth.

 ""My name is Scarlet Stone and my biggest fear is that someday I will find what I want most in life and it will be impossible to steal."" 
 Leave it to Jewel E. Ann to write THE most creative, refreshing and inventive storylines ever! Nothing you have ever read will prepare you for Scarlet Stone. A beautiful and sexy and surprising book, Scarlet and Theo will draw you in and steal your heart. Their story is gorgeous and their chemistry was real and very, very hot. 
 ""What if we started counting time in breaths instead of seconds? What if I could hold my breath and stop time?"" 
 All of the characters in this book are unforgettable. I don't know how Jewel E. Ann dreams up these larger-than-life personalities but I hope she never stops. Just when I thought I knew the direction this story was going in, it completely changed course! You can read the synopsis for this story but it is best read not knowing more so I will try to keep this review spoiler-free. 'Scarlet Stone' is funny, sexy, heartbreaking, emotional and very, very different. This author never disappoints. Scarlet is one of the most memorable heroines I have ever read! 
 ""My name is Scarlet Stone, and I'm drawn to anything out of the ordinary, the crazy, the eccentric. I've been this way all my life."" 
 If you are looking for an out-of-the-ordinary romance with tons of heat and heart, do not miss 'Scarlet Stone'! It is wildly inventive and perfectly readable. Another fantastic read from one of my favorite authors!

 The first book in the new Brooklyn Bruisers series was a total delight! ROOKIE MOVER has everything I love about Sarina Bowen's books: great writing, smart women, fine and sexxxy hockey players, and sweet, sweet first love. 
 Georgia and Leo have been apart for years after having been in love when they were in high school. Now Leo is the new trade for the Brooklyn Bruisers hockey team, where his former girlfriend is also working. Leo has never gotten over Georgia, and even though she was the one who broke up with Leo, she has never gotten over him, either. She has followed his career and now is face to face again with her one true love. 
 Ah, Leo. Georgia's happiness was all he ever cared about. His past with Georgia might keep him from reaching his full potential with the team, but he will never betray her secrets. He is a sexy, sweet, talented hockey player who brings just the right amount of steam and sweetness to this book. It's obvious these two still care for each other and their chemistry still burns bright after all these years have passed. 
 ""So fucking good,"" ... 
 ""Now give me that mouth."" 
 Sarina Bowen writes some of THE best sports romances around. There are great supporting characters in this book, and I'm thrilled that the next book will be O'Doul's story. ROOKIE MOVE is a fantastic start to the new Brooklyn Bruisers series! Highly recommended for all fans of sweet, steamy second-chance romances.

 I LOVED the premise of this book: a female motorcycle racer named Kenzie who races professionally. Her father was a legendary racer, and Kenzie is trying to carry on the family name. The racing scenes are fascinating and the story is very fast-paced. The author gives us an intimate, behind-the-scenes look into the highly competitive world of motorcycle racing. 
 Racing is literally in Kenzie's blood. She is under tremendous pressure to succeed and her father is not her biggest fan. Hayden races for a competitor and he is strictly off-limits to Kenzie. She is downright mean to him at first, and they have a love-hate thing going on that was very intense. Kenzie has a lot of preconceived notions about Hayden which, of course, turn out to be completely wrong. Hayden is sex--on-wheels and he and Kenzie begin a Romeo-and-Juliet romance that must be kept hidden from everyone. 
 Hayden is also an incredibly talented racer and Kenzie realizes she can learn a lot from him. They both actually race better when they are competing against each other. I absolutely love that the author created a female racer who is smart, strong and competitive in a traditionally male sport. Hayden is a DREAM and their scenes together are beautiful, sexxxxy and very believable. Overall, I really liked this book; it is a nice beach or poolside read and although some readers are not happy with the ending, I loved it!! There will definitely be more books to come in this series, and the next one sounds like it will be verrrry interesting!!

 OMG!!! I did not want this book to end!! What a page-turner. Moody, evocative and thrilling, Lisa Jewell's writing surprised and enthralled me from beginning to end. 
 This book begins with Alice, a frazzled single mother living in a tiny seaside town in England, finding a man, lost and alone and with no memory of how he came to be sitting on the beach in the driving rain. 
 Alice is funny, warm, witty and has not made the best choices in her life. In fact, her love life stinks so she is very wary of men in general. But something calls to her about this lost and confused man, and she brings him back to her cottage to recuperate in her guest house. 
 ""How long have you been sitting out here?"" 
 ""I got here yesterday."" 
 ""Where did you come from?"" 
 ""I have no idea."" 
 This brilliant story is told from multiple POV's spanning several decades. At the same time that Alice finds ""Frank"" (her nickname for the seemingly lovely man struggling with his memory loss), a young bride in London named Lily realizes her new husband has suddenly vanished. She is new to England and does not know anyone at all. The mystery of her missing newlywed husband is one of the driving forces of this gem of a book. 
 There are tons of twists and surprises in store for the reader. We do not know how the characters in this story are connected... or even if they are connected at all. 
 Flashing back decades before, young Gray and Kirsty are on holiday with their parents. Their fascinating story involves a local man who becomes interested in Kirsty. Their stories rocket towards a stunning conclusion with Alice, Frank and Lily. To say that I could not put this book down is an understatement! From the bustling London setting to the small seaside resort town, 'I Found You' sets the bar for romantic suspense books this year. 
 Long after finishing this book, I still can't stop thinking about the characters. Lisa Jewell is a new favorite author of mine. This was my first book by her and now I cannot wait to get to her other titles. Alice was completely relatable, even when she didn't make the wisest of choices. 
 I can't recommend this book highly enough! I loved every word.

 'The Protector' is a perfectly enjoyable, sexy, fast-paced story. 
 While it perhaps did not live up to JEM's superb story-telling potential, it was nonetheless am interesting and super-sexy story. I loved how the author presented another side to the heroine Camille: to the world, she is a rich, spoiled socialite. But she is actually smart and very ambitious and determined to build her own business from the ground up. She made lots of mistakes in the past, and some of those mistakes might be coming back to haunt her now. 
 Jake is PURE Alpha, a former SAS sniper who suffers from PTSD. Camille does not want his protection, AT ALL, but her father hires Jake to make sure that Camille is safe. Jake is also haunted by his own personal demons, but sees his job with Camille as a chance at redemption. 
 JEM remains one of my auto-buy authors. Her 'This Man' series is without question among my top favorite books of all time! And I absolutely fell in love with Miller in the 'One Night' series, another series that I HIGHLY recommend. Both Jesse and Miller are uber-Alphas beyond compare. 
 So I thought 'The Protector' had lots of sizzling sex scenes and very fast-paced action along with a mystery story as well. While this is not my favorite JEM story, definitely give the one a try if you love this kind of contemporary romance!

 Written in an unusually quirky style, Professed is a student/teacher romance about Ben, a college professor and 20-year-old Naomi. I will admit that it took me some time to get into this story, but once I did, I was engrossed in this very hot and at times very funny taboo romance. 
 First, heed the warnings about this book and be aware that this story is VERY explicit! Ben and Naomi meet at a secret masked ball and immediately begin a passionate affair. Dr. Ben Beck is a philosophy professor who has written a book and has been invited to join the faculty at Yale. He has always questioned the existence of love and now ironically, now finds himself head over heels in love with the smart and beautiful Naomi. 
 Once they become aware that Naomi is Ben's student, they are acutely aware of the risks they are taking. Naomi could lose her place at Yale andBen could lose his position on the faculty, at the very least. But this is actually a very fast-paced book and the author's brisk writing style and sense of humor make this a very readable story. 
 ""Forbidden fruit is always the sweetest."" 
 There are lots of things I loved about this book and some, not so much. I loved reading about Naomi's background and her family: she was raised by her father, a lobsterman in a New England town and she struggles to pay her way through college and to fit in at Yale. I would have loved to read more about Ben's background! The book is told in alternating POV's and the humor and brisk writing style lightens up the very explicit scenes. 
 Naomi's character was unusually mature for her age. Although I did not have an issue with the age gap, I was not totally convinced what a 38-year-old would find so alluring and compelling about a college junior. I would have also loved to have known more about the ""secret society"" masked ball where Naomi and Ben first met. 
 I loved Naomi's best friend Lucy and I know her story will be hilarious! This is certainly not your average student-teacher forbidden romance and for that, I applaud the author. Overall, Professed is a very sexy, very enjoyable and promising debut story.

 This is an EPIC story that was simply unputdownable, filled with characters that I will never, ever forget. The writing is outstanding! Nothing I can say in a review will do any justice to this gem but I will try. 
 Certainly not a story for everyone, the book is at its heart a love story and what can happen when two human beings really, truly, deeply love each other and care for each other. Wavy and Kellen meet when she is just a young girl, but she is wise beyond her years, having suffered horrible emotional and physical abuse. Wavy has the misfortune to be the daughter of a meth dealer and a mentally-unstable mother. She learns young how to take care of herself and fly under the radar. 
 There are lots of adults who drift in and out of her life and it is heartbreaking to see how misguided almost all of them are. From a well-meaning aunt to teachers who should know better, everyone basically fails Wavy and her little brother. Except for Kellen. 
 ""He smelled good. Sweat and motorcycle and wintergreen. No stinking weed smoke. No perfume. No sadness. He smelled like love"" 
 He is the one constant in her grim life, the one person she can always count on, no matter what. He provides her with shelter, clothing, all the basic needs that a parent should, plus love. I never viewed their relationship as odd, mostly because of the insightful points of view of the main characters. But for sure some readers will be uncomfortable with their age difference. 
 The author's use of different narrators is brilliant. Especially sympathetic is Wavy's cousin, who is in awe of Wavy's wild ways. Wavy lives on and off with her aunt and cousins, but they really never know the depth and depravity of Wavy's unstable home life. 
 ""Wavy in her black leather boots didn't fit in the catalog. She tore open the catalog and made surprising things happen. Like Ken in a dress."" 
 This book is the best book I've read all year. I could not put it down. My favorite parts of the book are when the author Bryn Greenwood describes how painful it is for Wavy to speak. Words are almost real, tangible things for Wavy, that can be felt and tasted. Brilliant. 
 This story spans many years and is filled with some of the most unforgettable characters that I have ever read. I absolutely loved how whip-smart Wavy was, and how she silently observed and took in everything around her. She is obsessed with the constellations and her sweet spot is gazing at the stars at night with her beloved Kellen. 
 ""I liked learning things. How numbers worked together to explain the stars. How molecules made the world. All the ugly and wonderful things people had done in the last two thousand years."" 
 Wavy never lost hope and pushed forward though life no matter how dire her circumstances were. My heart also broke for Kellen, a giant of a man who always treated Wavy with love and tenderness.

 The synopsis for this book really grabbed my attention. Jessica is a doctor at a women's prison and finds old letters written by an inmate that were never delivered. She makes it her mission to find the man the letters were written to, and her search leads her to a small beachside town. The residents are a tight-knit group but Jessica, who had been restless in her professional and personal life, finally feels like she is ""home"". 
 This is small-town romance at its best. I LOVED this very sexy, tender, warm-hearted and mature love story!! My favorite kind. The One Real Thing has fabulous writing and interesting, real and loyal secondary characters. 
 Cooper and Jessica share a deep connection and if you like off-beat characters with some good old-fashioned romance, then you will love this book. I am looking forward to more books in this series about the rest of the inhabitants of Hart's Boardwalk.

 A totally addictive but very, very sad story. I felt like I was witnessing a train wreck! The writing was for the most part very gripping, but this book is NOT for everyone. Tori is a romance author who feels very restless and unfulfilled in her personal life. Her husband Landon is a rising star in the restaurant world and she has two young children. She seeks fulfillment outside her marriage and finds one in an online relationship that eventually turns into a full-blown affair. Many tears are shed and much angst ensues. 
 The writing style threw me off a bit and interfered with my enjoyment of the story, but overall, I will say that I couldn't put this book down. So for that, kudos to E.K.

 Hellllooooo Coach Winter!! What a sexxxxy and intense sports romance!! I loved it!! Fascinating characters, a timely storyline and SUPER-hot steamy scenes make this book a winner!! R.S. Grey shows that she can write a great adult romance with this story. With the 2016 Summer Olympics right around the corner, this book about Olympic athletes hits all the right notes. Plus, it offers an intimate look into the often-isolated life of an elite gymnast. 
 ""I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. In gymnastics, if you're good, you're lonely."" 
 Brie Watson is the Cinderella story of the international gymnastic world. She and her mother have sacrificed EVERYTHING to get her to the Summer Games. And her coach Erik Winter knows all too well the pressures she is under, having suddenly dropped out of competitive athletics when he was at the top of his game. They are kindred souls, even though they fight constantly and even in the face of Erik's apparent iciness towards her. 
 ""She was fierce; she wanted to be seen, and not just for her gymnastics skills. No, she wanted to be desired. Coveted. Craved. Had anyone ever touched her the way she wanted to be touched?"" 
 This might be THE sexiest book yet from Ms. Grey. The passion between the hero and heroine literally lept off the pages!! I absolutely love the enemies-to-friends trope and it is done to perfection here. 
 ""Toying with Brie was quickly becoming my favorite pastime and a part of me wondered why I was doing it. Yes, she was disrespectful and constantly talked back during practice, but she was hardly the first strong-headed girl in my gym to be guilty of that. No, I was enjoying her punishment a little too much."" 
 OUT OF BOUNDS has the perfect blend of intense sports scenes, sexy, adult romance and emotion. There's no unnecessary drama here, just a perfectly readable, hot romance with a fantastic cast of characters. Even if you're not a fan of sports romance, give this one a try. You will fall in LOVE with Brie Watson and Erik Winter!

 ""Don't focus on the what ifs. Focus on what is."" 
 Vi Keeland continues to shine in this very enjoyable and well-written office romance. I have loved Ms. Keeland's writing ever since I read her MMA Fighter series (Worth the Fight is a fantastic book and very underrated in my opinion). I am thrilled to see her show off her wonderful writing style with Bossman, a story that combines elements of humor, wit and the perfect amount of drama. Reese is the kind of heroine I love: smart, driven, a little sarcastic and very funny. She and Chase meet when she is stuck on a very bad date and he comes to her rescue. The whole situation is handled so perfectly! Chase is totally sexy and funny and charming, and surprise! It turns out that he is the founder of the company where she is starting a brand-new job. The company has a no-fraternization policy plus Reese has been burned by in the past when she slept with a co-worker. She has no intention of dating Chase, but he sure has fun pursuing her. 
 Chase leaned over to me as we continued walking down the hall and whispered, ""Stop worrying. Harassment policy only applies to employees, not the owner. Checked this morning."" 
 I absolutely loved the slow-burn romance between Chase and Reese! Even though they do not fall into bed immediately, there is plenty of steam and genuine emotion when they do get together. She is scared of getting into a relationship with Chase because he is her boss's boss but Chase really cares for her and is impossible to resist. But just when you think everything will be perfect for these two, his past overcomes him and it seems as though he will never recover from the terrible trauma of an earlier relationship. 
 ""Sometimes you don't know what you're missing until you find it"" 
 I have to connect with the main characters to care at all about a story and I really connected with Reese and Chase. The book combined funny dialogue with some heavy emotion and it all just worked! I hope Vi Keeland writes more of these kinds of stories because they really show off her talent. I absolutely fell in love with Chase!! He's the total package and Reese's feelings for him just felt right. 
 ""I'm tired of looking back. It's been a long time since I've wanted to live in the moment."" 
 If you are new to Vi Keeland, give Bossman a try! It's got the perfect combination of great chemistry, emotion, a sexy and damaged hero and witty banter. I read this book in almost one sitting and loved the conclusion to Reese and Chase's story. Bossman is another great story from Vi Keeland, surprisingly angsty with the perfect amount of steam!!

 If you like lots of high school drama, then this book is for you! Broken Prince reminded me of Gossip Girl in many ways. However, the over-the-top cruelty of Reed and Ella's fellow students here turned me off. The main characters have lots of promise, and I really loved Reed and Ella. Many readers love this series, so I am in the minority on this one and definitely pick this one up if you are in the mood for a guilty-pleasure read! 
 ""He told me to stay away. He told me I didn't belong. If only I'd listened to him."" 
 The first book ended on a major cliffhanger and in this second installment, former mean-boy Reed is desperate to find Ella. She has brought happiness and goodness to his royally-screwed up family and he will do anything to bring her home and win back her love. BUT there are SO many obstacles standing in their way! 
 ""I can play this two ways. I can walk away. Or I can fight for you. Guess which one I'm doing?"" 
 This is very quick read and a very fast-paced story. The writing duo that makes up Erin Watt are incredibly talented, and I love their other books. If you know going in to Broken Prince that this is basically a teen soap-opera, then you will LOVE this juicy bit of fluff. But be warned: there is another cliffhanger! 
 I did love reading Reed's POV in this book. I felt his pain and the pressure he was under to try and protect the innocent Ella at all costs. I also loved the VERRRRY sexy Royal brothers!! There was just way too much unnecessary over-the-top drama for me. But if you are looking for a summer pool or beach read, then pick up Broken Prince and enjoy the crazy ride!

 This is a slow build romance and I absolutely loved the incredibly witty and sexy banter between the characters. Conway's writing is always a winner for me.

 Thrilling, sexy, second-chance contemporary sports romance with a twist. Somehow it all works in this perfect summer read! 
 And they would fight to their end for me. This team was my family, my soul. And I think that was what made everything that happened so damn complicated. 
 Tyler has grown up traveling with a baseball team her whole life. Baseball IS her life. She has been home-schooled, innocent, yet stunning and complete unaware of her effect on men. Then baseball's bad boy Chase Stern enters her life. A larger-than-life character, Alessandra Torre could have made him a cliche, but he is deeply sensitive, devoted to the game, and ready to give up his fast-living ways for Ty. 
 Chase Stern. The best bat to hit our game since Barry Bonds. A shortstop who made Ripken look like a rookie. A body built for baseball, a face that made GQ editors swoon, and enough swagger to fill Dodger stands with females. 
 Of course, Ty is forbidden to go near him, she is only 17 at the time and he plays for the team her father works for. But they fall deeply in love with each other, through stolen nights on the baseball field and living life on the road. She knows that he is completely off-limits, but these two share a deep bond that goes beyond the game of baseball. 
 But it wasn't his looks that had sucked me in. It was his play. His effortless grip of a game that we all struggled with. His swing, his throw, the dip of his body when he scooped up a ball, the stretch of his six-foot body when he leapt in the air ... it was my porn. 
 But then...the emotional one-two punch from the author hits and these two are suddenly, irrevocably separated . My heart broke for them!! Flash-forward several years and these two, now adults with their own lives, meet again. I absolutely LOVE second-chance romances, and MOONSHOT has everything I love about this trope. 
 First loves were supposed to be flimsy and temperamental. They were supposed to burn bright and fade fast. They weren't supposed to stick. They weren't supposed to eat away at a man's heart, his capacity for life. 
 Interwoven with this forbidden love story is a thriller aspect which slowly builds toward a terrifying conclusion. Ms. Torre is one of the few authors I know who can perfectly pull off such a clever post twist!! I was totally blindsided by this turn of events and it blended in perfectly with the story. It must be said that the author knows a LOT about the game of baseball and I loved reading about this part of the story, she has fabulous insight in to the game and I almost felt like I was in the stands ready for the players to take the field. MOONSHOT has everything I love about contemporary romance: deeply-felt characters; the sweetness of first love; very adult, steamy love scenes; and the bittersweet pain of second-chance romance. Please keep in mind that there is cheating in this book: this aspect of a story NEVER bothers me or affects my enjoyment of a novel but it is here in MOONSHOT plain and simple. Does it resolve itself? Absolutely. 
 Alessandra Torre is an automatic one-click for me andI loved this story!! Happy reading! 
 Favorite quote: 
 Certain loves can't be fought. The harder you tried, the harder you would be knocked back, over and over again, until it beat you into submission, until your heart caved and body surrendered. Love like that didn't know the rules of society; it didn't care about life mistakes. It only knew what must be, and what would happen--no matter what.

 I loved the in-depth look into the sport of baseball (but you do NOT need to be a fan of sports romances to love this story!) and the glimpse into the emotional highs and lows experienced by star athletes AND by their families and loved ones! The end of 'The Player' was a whopper of a cliffhanger (I won't spoil it here!) and then BOOM! 'The Catch' does a 180 degree turn! 
 I appreciated Easton's POV here and as always, Ms. Bromberg created a male character with many dimensions.

 The highly-anticipated third book in The Royals Series picks up right where the second book ended so the other books MUST be read in order! While overall I liked the teen-angst feel of this series, the third book felt a bit rushed at times and I felt that Ella and Reed lost some of the heat and passion that fueled the first two books. With that said, this writing duo is very talented and the wild storyline certainly held my interest. 
 In 'Twisted Palace', Ella is firmly in place as a member of the Royals household. Gone is the taunting and name-calling from the first book. Ella and Reed are now completely in love! 
 ""Sometimes I still can't believe that we all hated each other when I first got here. Reed was determined to destroy me. His brothers alternately taunted or ignored me. I fantasized about running away on a daily basis. And now I can't imagine not having the Royals in my life."" 
 Reed has been arrested for the murder of Brooke and the evidence seems pretty strong against him. There are tons of questions in this book. Everyone at school is talking about Reed and giving damaging testimony against him. His past seems to catch up to him and his future looks very grim. Add to that is the fact that Steve is now back! There is TONS of drama plus wild plot twists in this book which makes 'Twisted Palace' feel much more suspenseful than the first two books. I liked the forbidden-love aspect of the earlier books but this book adds almost a mystery element to the series. 
 Reed is loyal to his core. He'd die for his family. 
 Hell, he might've even killed for it. 
 This series is great for readers who love over-the-top drama and first-love stories. I really liked the supporting characters and I hope some of them will get their own story! I also would LOVE a story about Callum Royal. While the brothers don't get as much focus here as in the earlier books, fans of this series will be happy to get more of Reed and Ella. Overall not my favorite in this series but still a fun, light, read that is a total guilty pleasure.

 A Gift of Time is a gift to the readers of the Nine Minutes series. The story flows beautifully through many different time frames, and back and forth between many different points of view. But it all works perfectly and the author has a BIG surprise waiting for fans of this series! 
 I feel that A Gift of Time is, more than any other character's, Ginny's story. If you have read the first two books in the series (and you MUST before reading A Gift of Time), you know that Ginny has been through a lifetime of experiences and has had two great loves in her life. I have always loved both Grizz and Tommy, and I absolutely LOVED how the author resolves the famous Team Grizz/Team Grunt conflict here. This book is told in flashback so all the main characters make an appearance here, all leading toward a fascinating and satisfying conclusion. 
 ""There were just some secrets we had to keep hidden in our hearts to shield those we love."" 
 It is impossible to describe the plot of A Gift of Time without giving anything away. This series is a creative, thrilling, imaginative, beautiful and ultimately uplifting story that I won't soon forget. Grrizz, Grunt and Kit will live on forever! Bravo, Ms. Flynn, for a fantastic conclusion to a terrific series.

 Non-stop action, plus tons of graphic violence, a feisty heroine and an ex-con with a soul!! BLOOD TO DUST features a kick-ass heroine, a damaged hero and a story that will have you saying, ""Did I just read that??"" I became a huge fan of LJ Shen's after reading SPARROW and could not wait to get my hands on Prescott and Beat's story. She is hell-bent on revenge on a group of men who are dangerous, corrupt members of a crime family. They have ruined her family, and committed terrible crimes against her. The only problem is that she is being held against her will by them. She is outnumbered and defenseless. And of her captors is Beat. 
 Beat served time in prison with one of the men holding Prescott captive. He owes the a favor to one of the men, the sadistic and all-powerful Godfrey, and Beat (whose real name is Nate) just wants to fulfill his debt as soon as possible. Nate has committed murder in the past but he won't let any physical harm come to Prescott. As the captor and the captive spend more time together, Prescott and Nate begin to bond. Although he doesn't trust her at first (and rightfully so!), these two are kindred spirits who devise a plan to to repay their debts, seek vengeance and maybe, just maybe, find their own brand of happiness. 
 ""We're polar opposites. He's peace looking for color and I'm strorm looking for serenity."" 
 I love dark reads and I really liked this book (the author has a GREAT sense of humor) but felt the story spun out of control in some places. With that being said, Nate Vela is an unforgettable anti-hero!! Sensitive, strong, protective and damaged, I won't soon forget him. And Prescott is one of the strongest, most bad-ass heroines I have ever read. If you love a dark and gritty read, then you will love BLOOD TO DUST. I adore this author and can't wait to see what twisted story she comes up with next!

 WOW!! What a passionate, emotional and sexy story! Love, betrayal, loyalty, forgiveness...this book has it all!! I couldn't put this one down!! I absolutely love enemies-to-lovers books, especially where there is an element of revenge. Plus, I adore Mia Sheridan's writing so I could not wait to read this book. And I will admit I do sometimes judge a book by its cover, and this cover is STUNNING. So there's that. 
 I immediately connected with these beautifully flawed and damaged characters. Their pain, suffering, humiliation and pride broke my heart and Mia Sheridan put it back together again. While Lydia could have been a cookie-cutter, snobby heroine, she instead came across as loyal, loving and willing to admit to her past mistakes. And they were HUGE. A stupid and cruel act when she was a teenager led to a domino effect of tragic consequences for Brogan Ramsay and his family. And now he is back in Lydia's life, hell-bent on getting revenge for the pain she caused him all those years before. 
 ""Learn from you mistakes, but don't let them define you now. Find forgiveness, for them and for yourself."" 
 Watching Lydia and Brogan slowly make their way back into each other's lives was painful, raw and breathtaking. So much drama and heartache separated these two that I lost thought they would never find their way back. There is an element of romantic suspense here which Mia Sheridan got just right. And the cast of supporting characters are all fabulous. (Fionn!! HELLO!!) Are there some pieces that don't quite fit together? Yes, but they are non-essential to the story and the characters are so strong that they swept me away. I was lost in this book and savored every minute of it. 
 Brogan Ramsay had come from Ireland with his family and I loved how the author incorporated Gaelic throughout the book. What a beautiful and descriptive language! Ms. Sheridan's books always leave a lasting impression and Ramsay is no different. I am still thinking about the characters well after I finished this book. I fell in love with Ramsay Brogan and although he has't quite replaced Archer as my favorite Mia Sheridan hero, he comes close! Don't miss Ramsay, you will fall i love with these characters, too.

 Fans of the Rosemary Beach series will love this book. I have read most of the books in this series and have loved some more than others, and in Up In Flames, Abbi Glines throws in lots of surprises! This book is VERY different from the other books in the series!! I was so excited for Nan's book and to see how in the world the author was going to redeem this very unloveable, vengeful character. And she did it!! 
 Nan has been the villain in this series, cold, spiteful and generally a bad person. The only person who ever seemed to care for her was her brother Rush. I devoured this book in one sitting daily because of Gannon. OMG is he hot!! There are two men vying for Nan's heart in this book and I was so glad I didn't read any spoilers. The author surprised me here with some very wild and explicit sex scenes. I also loved how Nan seemed to finally make peace with her family, especially with those she has been so cruel to in the past. And yes, Nanette does get her happy ending!!! This is a sexy, fast-paced read, perfect for a summer beach read. Lots of surprises in this one. Thanks, Abbi, for finally making Nan into a character I could actually care about!

 ""Do you hate your husband?"" 
 ""I never hated him."" 
 ""You're about to."" 
 Nuanced, layered and intriguing, I loved everything about this book!! A must-read. 
 Adam Steinbeck has just been dealt a blow. His beloved wife Diana is leaving him. Partners in business and in life, he is in total shock. His emotions are raw, exposed and real. He doesn't know what to do or how to make things right again. He cannot live without Diana. 
 ""The first time I saw her, I had to hold my breath. The first time she spoke, I exhaled."" 
 But Adam has been living a lie with his wife. He never revealed to her who he really was. A Dominant. He gave it all up for her, and now he realizes that she must have sensed he was holding something back from her, never fully giving himself to her. 
 Perfect Diana...What would I do to posses her? Would I change my cellular structure? Turn my back on my identity? Walk away from it, never talk about it, burn it so thoroughly into a pile of dust that not telling her wouldn't be a lie? 
 This raw and powerful book alternates between past and present so we really get a sense of the shared history between Adam and Diana. This story rockets towards a breathtaking conclusion as only CD Reiss can do. Her writing is crisp, clear, intelligent and very, very sensual. The depth of Adam's love for his wife is almost palpable and he will not let her walk away without a fight. And so she agrees to his detailed plan to spend 30 days alone together, away from their business in New York City. Adam is going to show Diana who he really is. The stakes are high but Adam plays to win. 
 ""I can only breathe if I know she's there. I gave her my f*king soul and she threw it away. Months ago, maybe years ago. She made a decision to throw me away. She's prepared for this divorce, and I'm swinging in the wind. Raw. With nothing. No defenses. Now what am I supposed to do?"" 
 I could not breathe while I was reading this book!! It is incredibly sexy, thought-provoking and emotional. I loved every word. The ending was nothing short of shocking and I'm counting the days until the second book!! 
 ""She's my life, do you understand?""

 ""Only a little."" 
 I have heard amazing things about the first two books in this series so I couldn't wait to read I Everything I Left Unsaid. I did NOT feel lost reading this book even though I had not read the first two books. Max and June/Olivia are two incredible characters , and the writing is crisp, clean, intense and INCREDIBLY sexy. 
 June has a sister who is being held against her will by a cult. She dreams up a wild plan to rescue her which does not go according to plan and she ends up wounding and kidnapping Max, a dangerous MC President. Olivia is crazy about Max but he is a very dangerous man and can't be trusted. She brings him to her estranged aunt's house to recuperate from his wounds. The scenes in Florida at Aunt Fern's condo are priceless. And the slow burn starts to build between Olivia and Max, both damaged people who have led pretty sad and lonely lives. 
 ""Mutual assured destruction. You and I have sex, get involved in that way...both us burn. Both of us. We'll tear each other apart until there's nothing left to walk away from."" 
 Olivia is a loner and doesn't dare dream of ever being happy. She makes sure to sabotage anything good that comes into her life. The story itself is gritty, somewhat dark and definitely NOT your typical contemporary romance. There is no insta-love, and it takes quite a while for those two to get together. This book is VERY steamy and includes a sexy F/F scene that is incredibly hot. But the action, the scenes between Max and Olivia and the swoony scenes that eventually happened between Max and Olivia were all absolutely perfect. There is a wonderful Epilogue and I loved the conclusion that Ms. O'Keefe gave to these very troubled characters.

 ""He changed the story."" 
 Hellloooo, Damien!! I LOVED this very funny, passionate and emotional story from the fabulous Penelope Ward!!! Having read STEPBROTHER DEAREST, I could not WAIT to dive into this story. BUT even though that is one of my favorite books, and I highly recommend it, you do NOT have to read it first. 
 Chelsea has been left completely brokenhearted by her ex, Elec. She thought he was the ""one"". He declared his devotion to her and she thought they would grow old together. But it was just not meant to be. Chelsea moves into a new apartment in a new neighborhood to escape the memories of her old life. At first it seems as though her HOT new neighbor Damien can't stand her, but then they begin to build a fantastic friendship that turns oh-so-slowly into a gorgeous romance. 
 Damien is a brilliant artist who also happens to own the building where Chelsea lives. He has two Rottweilers who play a big part of this story and who are one of the reasons why Damien and Chelsea meet and get off to a rocky start to begin with. There's lots more to Damien then meets the eye, and learning about him is part of the wonderful experience of reading this book. 
 Chelsea is extremely insecure after being suddenly dumped by Elec, and Damien's compliments and the way he sees her really help to boost her confidence. She is wildly attracted to Damien but he makes it clear she is in the friend-zone. But why can't they be more than just friends?? Has his heart been broken, too? What secret is he hiding?? 
 ""I looked closer at what I'd messaged him and realized it hadn't come through the way I'd intended. the auto correct had actually changed the message to: Wanna duck? Great. That was smooth."" 
 Damien is the whole package: smart, hot, loving, sweet, attentive...but why is he constantly pushing Chelsea away? 
 ""You're in my heart and I can't get you out. I don't know if I want to. Being with you is the only thing that feels right."" 
 NEIGHBOR DEAREST is a VERY sexy, character-driven book that is totally readable and perfectly swoony. Ms. Ward has created another unforgettable book boyfriend with Damien. The supporting characters are all fantastic. And I absolutely LOVED the message of this book: things happen for a reason and just because someone leaves you, it doesn't mean that you can't find happiness again. *SIGH* 
 ""You know why it didn't work out with him?"" 
 ""Why?"" 
 ""Because God made you for me.""

 If Penelope Douglas writes a book, I will read it! And this series is one of my favorites, so I could not wait to get back into these characters' lives! And what a treat! Once again, Ms. Douglas surprises and puts a fresh spin on her beloved characters. This book introduces us to Quinn, but also sets up the next generation of characters and it was just a pleasure to read. 
 The author uses a story within a story here which added a layer of nuance and depth to what I thought would be a classic New Adult romance. Ms. Douglas gives us the backstory of Katherine Trent and Jason Caruthers and it broke my heart! Yes, you will absolutely need to read the other books in the series first but Bully and the later books are among my most cherished stories. From adult contemporary romance to new adult stories, Ms. Douglas can do it all. 
 ""Why did you marry her?"" she asked me in return. 
 I turned my eyes back out to the road as I would my way through her neighborhood. 
 Because I didn't see you first. 
 My heart!! The author does a wonderful job of telling two parallel stories here. The book felt a little sad to me at times because of the theme of lost time but the author gives her characters the perfect conclusion here. Don't miss Next to Never! It is a clever love letter to the fans of the Fall Away Series.

 She's baaaaack!! Penelope Douglas has written another dark and delicious and riveting story in the Devil's Night series. I could not WAIT for Kai's story and it was everything I hoped for! Secrets are revealed, inner desires unleashed with a heart-pounding romance at the heart of to all. 
 Kai's story was incredible. Ms. Douglas is one of the most talented romance writers around and I just knew that she would create another romantic suspense story like no other. 'Hideaway' is just as dark os 'Corrupt' and will satisfy your every craving. Kai is an alpha like no other - dark, dangerous and SMART. 
 ""We're only ever good, because there are consequences,"" I told her. ""Take those away, and everyone shows their true self. Kind of like taking off a mask."" 
 This book alternates back and forth between the present and Devil's Night six years before. Kai has finally met his match in Banks, a mysterious figure who may or may not have some connection to him. The chemistry between them is perfect, as I would expect with a Penelope Douglas book, but not instant. They have an intense and sexy connection but to say more would ruin the experience of reading this story. I am glad I did not know too much about the plot. It was INSANE!! 
 ""Happy to hear it, because I'm the only man whose attention you should be trying to get, and baby, you got it years ago while wearing another man's clothes."" He kissed my temple, his hot breath sending chills down my spine. ""So you can imagine how fucking beautiful you are to me right now wearing mine."" 
 There are tons of twists and turns and part of the enjoyment of reading this yummy tale was the ending. This book is definitely for fans of dark romance: this is not a hearts-and-flowers kind of book. But if you are a fan of the Four Horsemen from 'Corrupt', then you will devour 'Hideaway'! It is raw and gritty and WILD. And there is a fabulous sneak peek from 'Kill Switch', Devil's Night #3. I can't wait to see how Ms. Douglas tells Damon's story!!

 WOW!! What an emotional roller coaster ride! LAST TOUCH is a totally hot and sexy conclusion with a fantastic psychological-thriller aspect. Laurelin Paige once again shows her incredible talent for creating nuanced characters and dominating, irresistible heroes. 
 The ending of the first book was SUCH a cliffhanger, that I could not WAIT to get my hands on the second book in this series!! And LAST KISS does not disappoint. Laurelin Paige writes very adult, very sexy books and she kept me guessing throughout this whole story. Emily is insatiable for Reeve in this book and their chemistry burns up the pages. 
 God, I was hungry for him. I roved my hands over his chest, wanting to touch all of his body at once, delighting at the hard muscles that met the underside of my palms. He was solid everywhere. A wall of strength and potency that could so easily overpower me. I was weak in his presence, incapable of anything except to yield. 
 I loved Reeve Sallis from the beginning of this series (weird, I know!) and I adored his uber-Alpha ways. He obviously loves Emily but his loyalties are called into question here. There are tons of surprises in this book so I can't say anything about the plot in case you haven't read the first book in the series (which I HIGHLY recommend!!) These two are on absolutely FIRE when they are together. These are two adults who have lived through a lot and Emily might have finally found someone with who she can be completely herself. 
 He leaned his hip against the vanity and folded his arms across his chest, a position that highlighted both his broad shoulders and toned biceps. ""You like it when I keep you guessing,"" he said dismissively, not an entirely inaccurate statement, though it was a bit discomforting that he knew it so well. ""And I like you on your toes,"" he added, his eyes dark as they slid the length of my body. 
 LAST KISS is a super-sexy, romantic suspense that rockets toward a riveting conclusion. I could not put this book down!! Laurelin Paige is on my short list of must-read authors and she kept me on my toes throughout this whole book. The sexy times are TOTALLY hot, believable, adult and very raw. There are many characters that kept me second-guessing the plot and I certainly did not see this ending coming. Who was the bad guy? Was there even a bad guy in this story? You must read this book to find out!! 
 A warning bell sounded in the back of my head, though, urging me to get my wits together and address . . . something. It was dificult to remember what exactly when his hands were on my breasts, squeezing and pinching. The bite of pain sent jolts of electricity through my nervous system, signals that my brain read as pleasure. Pleasure I couldn't resist. 
 If you are a fan of sexy, suspenseful stories with an irresistible, Alpha male and a very strong heroine, then I highly recommend this series. You won't be able to put these books down!

 What an opening line!! What would you do if the person you loved and thought was gone, suddenly re-appeared in your life, after you had moved on? This is the center of Taylor Jenkins Reid's fantastic new novel, ONE TRUE LOVES. From this powerful beginning, this story follows Emma as she must reconcile finding her long-lost first love with her new life and her new fiance, Sam. 
 Emma and Jesse had been crazy in love and absolutely devoted to each other. They met as teenagers and ended up married and moving away from their small New England town to California. A tragic accident takes Jesse away, and after an agonizing period of mourning, Emma finds herself opening up to the possiblity of loving another man again. 
 I think that perhaps everyone has a moment that splits their life in two. When you look back on your own timeline, there's a sharp spike somewhere along the way, some event that changed you, changed your life, more than the others. A moment that creates a ""before"" and an ""after."" 
 Told from Emma's POV, this book tells the story of how Emma and Jesse first fell in love. The author does an amazing job of creating very memorable characters who seemed very real. I felt like I knew Emma, Jesse and Sam and their friends and families. It is very important for me to feel connected to the main characters and I absolutely connected with all of the characters in this book. I loved how Emma grew and matured throughout this book and how her relationships with those around her changed and evolved as well. 
 Good things don't wait until you're ready. Sometimes they come right before, when you're almost there. And I figured when that happens, you can let them pass by like a bus not meant for you. Or you can get ready. So I got ready. 
 I cannot think of enough to say about this gorgeous book!! Emma, Jesse and Sam's story is so totally engrossing, you will feel like you are reading about your good friends. I cared deeply about what was going to happen to these three and was completely blown away by the direction this book took. This is a richly written, detailed story about first love, family, friendship and growing up. The ending is enormously satisfying and I found myself re-reading passages this book after I finished. I was not ready to say goodbye to these characters! ONE TRUE LOVES is certainly one of the best books of the year and one of new top favorite books ever. Don't miss this one!!

Bromberg once again delivers with this sexy-sweet, second-chance love story with all new characters. The settings, the story, the characters...I simply fell in love with Hayes and Saylor!! 
 The author is one of my top go-to contemporary romance authors and 'Sweet Cheeks' is a perfect example of her easy, romantic and sexy writing style. 
 Saylor recently called off her engagement and is shocked when she receives an invitation to her former fiancee's wedding. She is a smart, driven businesswoman who owns her own bakery. What is she to do? While not one to engage in unnecessary drama, she finds herself in an unusual ""situation"" after her assistant accidentally replies that she will be attending the wedding. With a guest! 
 She is convinced to attend the destination wedding and to bring as her ""plus-1"" her old love, Hayes Whitely. Oh but guess what: he is now a Hollywood superstar, having abandoned Saylor years ago without a word when he left for Hollywood. Why on earth would she even consider this crazy idea?! But Hayes is VERY convincing and off they go to the tropics. A part of Saylor does want to show off to her ex, but she realizes that she could wind up getting her heart stomped on in a big way. 
 Hayes may be a well-known actor, but Saylor was his true love. Can he ever make amends for what he did, and win back Sailor's trust? And love? 
 Even at the age of seventeen, Hayes could kiss in a way that made me feel like I'd just laid every part of my soul on the line when his lips left mine. 
 If you are looking for a breezy, sexy, adult romance with a strong heroine and a sweet and sexy hero who just won't give up (and who happens to be the best friend of the heroine's brother!!), then 'Sweet Cheeks' is for you! 
 The way I see it , sometimes things happen in life and love's put on hold. But if someone's your soulmate, nothing is going to stop you from together in the end.

The writing in 'The Deep End' is VERY different from other Kristen Ashley books but not to fear, the author turns the heat WAY up in this book. I'll be honest, I had to think about this story for a while after I finished reading it. 
 I loved the plot of this book. The heroine Amelia is a Domme and is very accepting of herself and her needs. She was unapologetic about her lifestyle and for that, I applaud the author. In many other ways, she was just a normal human being with a desire to build a relationship with someone outside the BDSM scene and club life. 
 Amelia is a member of the ultra-exclusive club The Bee's Honey. They have a very rigorous screening process and she knows the men she will meet will have to pass certain requirements before they can walk in the door. She has never quite met the ""perfect"" sub but once she sets her sights on Olivier, all bets are off. He's her dream man, an Alpha sub who can meet her every need. He is everything I love about a KA hero: strong, confident, loving and caring. I had a bit of difficulty with their dynamic because he didn't seem like he was really a true submissive but their relationship worked. Olivier and Amelie didn't have a ""typical"" D/s relationship (if there even is such a thing) but they both seemed perfect for each other. 
 I am a diehard Kristen Ashley fan so I will read anything this woman writes. I LOVED the erotic aspects of this story and the BDSM scenes did not offend me at all. I think that KA writes some very explicit sex scenes but 'The Deep End' is VERY explicit!! If you are a fan of this author's books, then definitely give this one a try. It is different and intriguing and has some very unique characters. Just be prepared to be surprised. Enjoy!!

 ""How long does it take to fall in love? A second? A week? A year? It's like asking how long it takes to fall asleep. Some people are gone as soon as their head hits the pillow. Others lie awake for hours, and it's only when their brain stops churning for a while that sleep sneaks in and drags them under. That's how I visualize people falling in love. Some people fall so easily, they seem reckless. They love freely and unashamed. Those people are idiots. Or at least I used to think so. Until now."" 
 GAH!!! MY HEART!! Wicked Heart is the story of Elissa (who is Ethan's sister from Bad Romeo & Broken Juliet). One night, she happens to run into Liam Quinn, and he steals her heart. But fate has other plans for these two, and sadly, Elissa finds herself without Liam, and clueless as to why he disappeared from her life. Flash-forward years later and Elissa and Liam are working on the same stage production. Excerpt now, Liam is a superstar and has an equally famous fiance. 
 Elissa is a professional and as stage manager, she is not allowed to become involved with any to the actors on the production. Liam broke her heart years before and she is trying her best not to let his new relationship crush her again. Liam still cares about her but being ""just friends"" with him might be too painful for her already fragile heart. 
 ""Friends"" is one of those terms that seems benign but has a whole host of barbed-wire boundaries. Once you've made love to someone with so much passion that his name is branded on all your cells, is it possible to ever think of him as just a friend? Or is the heat of on old flame always going to lie dormant, just waiting to consume you again?"" 
 But just you don't think this book is all angst, Leisa Rayven writes incredibly witty and funny dialogue to lighten up the mood. I found myself swooning, laughing AND crying while reading Wicked Heart!! 
 A shudder of pleasure runs up my spine. ""Oh, I wouldn't dream of destroying such perfection. Are those hospital corners?"" ""If you find that sexy, then yes."" I let out a soft groan. ""Such a turn-on."" He chuckles, thinking I'm teasing, but I'm really not. I'm a self-confessed neat freak, and knowing he keeps a tidy house makes me all kinds of hot. ""Well, if you're finished eye-fucking my bed,"" he says, ""I have something else to show you."" ""If it's a recently cleaned bathroom, I don't think my body's ready."" 
 This book is filled with sexual tension, heat, humor and heartache. The author's writing is so beautiful that I was swept away while reading this book. While I recommend reading the fantastic Bad Romeo and Broken Juliet before reading Wicked Heart, it is not necessary in order to enjoy this story. Oh and did I mention that I LOVE Liam?

 ""You are important, and you can't be replaced. Hang on."" 
 NO ONE writes dark and edgy young adult books like Penelope Douglas! I LOVE the message of this sexy and angsty book. Ryen and Misha are unforgettable! 
 Even if you aren't a fan of YA books, 'Punk 57' has enough adult scenes and intense sexual chemistry to satisfy. This is what keeps me coming back again and again to this author's books. Yes, there are tons of tough scenes; especially hard to take are the painful scenes from high school. Not pretty. This book is somewhat dark and angsty and is almost a hybrid between 'Corrupt' and the 'Fall Away' series. 
 This is a classic love/hate/love story. Both characters were pen pals from a young age, pouring their hearts out to each other in a series of letters written over the years. They felt that they could only be themselves with the other; and they each brought out the best in the other. However, they have sworn to be anonymous, pledging to not seek the other out on social media. So when Ryen meets Misha in person for this first time, she has no idea who he is. Misha has been in love with Ryen for years but he hates the person she is now. Or who he ASSUMES she is. 
 ""And then when I found out she was popular, not an outcast, and a cardboard cut-out, not at all original, I became angry. She led me to believe those things, and my muse was a lie."" 
 Yes, you must suspend disbelief for a minute here to believe that two teenagers in 2016 could really stay oblivious to the other's true identity. BUT there is so much nuance to this story and so many twists and turns that I could go along with that part of the story. 
 How do you tell your friend-- your best friend-- that you've been right here, under her nose, playing with her like a puppet? 
 'Punk 57' is raw and BRUTALLY honest. Ultimately, it delivers an uplifting, beautiful and important message to anyone with a negative self-image or low self-esteem. And for that, I applaud the author. 
 ""They'll never matter to us, Ryen. 
 No one knows how this feels.""

 Sexy, sweet, and heartwarming with some very witty moments. My first Lex Martin book and I loved it! You can absolutely read Shameless as a standalone, even though Brady appeared in Finding Dandelion. Shameless has heart, characters I connected with and wonderful supporting characters. Brady is a tattoo artist who happens to have a Fine Arts degree and also rides a Harley. He travels from Boston to his brother's farm in Texas after a sudden tragedy to take over the care of his baby niece. I was already swooning before I even got to the baby part. 
 ""Here is this hot man, tattoos decorating his rugged arms, muscles tugging at the fabric, asking me about the baby's binkie while he holds her close to his chest."" 
 Katherine is helping with the care of the baby and staying on the farm after the sudden loss of her best friend. She is nerdy but beautiful and sweet and Brady is very attracted to her. He is drawn to her kindness and devotion to the baby and the farm. And when he learns about her background...well, his heart and my heart broke for her! She had a very tough childhood but attended college on a full scholarship. She is hard-working and humble but Brady thinks they can never be in a committed relationship. He needs to go back to Boston and Katherine has roots in Texas . Plus they are both dealing with loads of grief and guilt. Not the best time to fall in love. 
 It is very hard for a writer to create a connection between her characters and the reader but Lex Martin has done an outstanding job with this in Shameless. I really cared about Katherine and Brady and what would happen to their new ""family"" and to blossoming their relationship. Shameless is swoony and passionate and funny and sexy, with the added bonus of the fantastic Texas Hill Country setting. 
 This was a solid romantic read for me, with all the right elements. Brady was tender, sexy, and hot; Katherine was funny, smart, sexy and strong. I am still thinking about these characters days after finishing the book, which is always a good sign for me. I can't wait to go through my Kindle and read Lex martin's other books!

 ""I could be whatever I wanted beneath him."" 
 WOW!! What a dark and delicious ride. NOT for everyone but I loved it. 
 Nikki Sloane is a writer of very erotic and sexy stories. I have enjoyed her earlier books so I was very intrigued when she announced she was writing a dark romance. SORDID is very different from her earlier books and features a shy, somewhat nerdy, smart heroine. Addison goes to a frat party where she meets up with her crush, Luka, a teaching assistant from one of her math classes. Addison is insecure and socially awkward, and wants to ""let go"" for once in her life. She has too much to drink at the party and ends up with Luka. 
 The story then takes a 180 degree turn and Luka turns out to be extremely dangerous and controlling. He literally captures Addison and wont let her go. SORDID contains scenes of non-consensual sex so if this is a trigger for you, do not read this book. Luka is sexy and desirable BUT he is also cruel and abusive toward Addison at the beginning of this story. Nikki Sloane redeems him a little by the end of the book, which also has undertones of romantic suspense, but this is a very, very dark book. With that said, the sex scenes are also incredibly hot and erotic and the story is very fast-paced and surprising. 
 ""His reality is cruel and dark. He traps me in his web, his power twisting tighter the more I struggle, until it's hopeless. I can't break free."" 
 This is an edgy, graphic story with a fascinating cast of characters. Luka's motivations are revealed by the end of the story but we never really know what he is thinking because the book is told from Addison's POV. I loved how she stayed strong throughout this story, even as she was incredibly conflicted about her feelings toward Luka. Their relationship was certainly non-traditional for sure, but it somehow worked for me. Luka had a raw appeal and accepted what kind of person he was. SORDID is not the most graphic or taboo book I have ever read but it is close. Nikki Sloane is a gifted writer and my only issue with the book is that I would have liked a little more written about Luka's family! So hopefully another book will be coming that will explain more about his very dangerous family. 
 SORDID is a rough and raw read, but fans of dark erotic romance will love this one. There is a ton of very, very graphic sex in this book. But any book that makes me think about the characters after I have finished is a winner, and trust me, Luka is a VERY memorable character! 
 ""I control every part of you. Repeat it."" I was trembling in my core. Instinctively I wanted to fight against him, but I also wanted to please. I wanted to succeed. I stumbled over the words. ""You control every part of me.""

 I couldn't wait to read this new series from Raine Miller. Loosely connected to the Blackstone Affair series, the new Blackstone Dynasty introduces Caleb Blackstone, a wealthy businessman who is handsome, brilliant, driven, and of course, all alone. His life is filled with one-night stands and no permanence. He neither has the time or the interest in a lasting relationship. His family is wealthy and he does seems to have it all. Raine Miller writes an Alpha male like nobody's business and you can add Caleb Balckstone to the short list of handsome, passionate heroes. 
 Yes, there is some insta-love here BUT Raine Miller is a masterful writer and takes time to build her characters. When Caleb first sees the pretty Brooke, he smitten. Their later chance encounter at a party leaves a lasting impression on him. Little does he know that their families actually share a long history together. But Brooke, who is working several jobs, has ZERO interest in a serious relationship. She has suffered great loss in her life and was forced to leave her home England at a young age to live with her grandmother in America. Caleb and Brooke are both totally blind-sided by their mutual attraction. 
 ""Nothing was familiar when it came to Brooke. Each new thing we shared together felt to me as if I'd never done it before, and more importantly, as if I never wanted to do it again with anyone other than her--ever."" 
 I loved how Ms. Miller touched on the loneliness that both of her main characters felt. It was very poignant and made Caleb and Brooke's growing relationship all the more sweeter. I also adored how devoted Caleb was to Brooke and their passion together was INCREDIBLE! If you are looking for a beautifully written contemporary romance that is fairly low on the drama and angst, then 'Filthy Rich' is for you. The author made the New England setting come alive for me and I absolutely ADORE the cover of this book. The cover model Adam Cowie is THE perfect Caleb Blackstone. 
 While this book is a standalone, there will be another book coming in this series in February of 2017 for more about the Blackstone family! 
 ""When you find whatever it is that makes you happy, Caleb, hold on to it with everything you've got. Your heart will let you know.""

 Thank you, Joanna Wylde, for the fabulous Tinker Garrett!! She's a smart, feisty, funny heroine who isn't 20 years old. And Gage...HOLY HOTNESS!! Gage and Tinker's story was a hot and sweet slow burn romance, with the perfect amount of humor, depth and emotion. 
 I read a lot of MC stories and Joanna Wylde remains one of the best writers in this genre. The Reapers is one of my favorite MC series and I knew from the first few pages that this would be an exciting, witty and sexy story. 
 Gage is above all else loyal to his club. He hates his current undercover assignment, mainly because he has a fake girlfriend which is stopping him from claiming the stunning Tinker. The Club always comes before all else. 
 ""Reapers forever, forever Reapers. 
 Sometimes loyalty sucks."" 
 Tinker Garrett is certainly not Gage's usual ""type"" - she is smart, runs a thriving business, owns her own home and is taking care of her elderly father. Not the usual young girls Gage toys with. And I absolutely adored Tinker's best friend!! But Gage soon realizes he could have something real and beautiful with Tinker and he sets out to claim what's his. 
 I turned, catching the back of her head and pulling her in for a hard kiss, because fuck loyalty. 
 There is a lot going on in this book plot-wise, no question. But Ms. Wylde ties everything together AND really makes you CARE about the main characters. As always, the Washington State setting is perfect and well-researched. And can we talk about the ending and the fantastic Epilogue?? Both surprisingly sweet and sentimental, they added another level of emotional depth to an already great story. 
 REAPER'S FIRE is another fantastic, sexy and totally engrossing story from the talented Joanna Wylde.

 Jewel E. Ann has become my new favorite author!! I DEVOURED the Jack & Jill Series, and One features two characters from that series. Although this book can technically be read as a standalone, PLEASE PLEASE read the unforgettable books in the Jack & Jill Series first because there are some major spoilers. The author calls this genre Romantic Comedy but it so much more! Swoony romance, funny dialogue, dramatic moments and SEXY scenes...Cage and Lake are two very memorable characters. 
 Lake became an amputee after a tragic car accident that took the life of her fiancee. She has moved away from her family in California to Minneapolis, where she once again runs into the football star Cage, with whom she once shared an unforgettable kiss. She cat get Cage out of her head and cant believe he remembers her, too. Cage really sees Lake, not her disability, and she can't get him out of head. 
 ""Mind if I lose the leg?"" I asked. 
 He shook his head. There really were no words to describe how his lack of any sort of reaction made me feel. 
 Not one flinch. 
 Not one nervous glance at my leg. 
 Not one second of hesitation. 
 Cage is sexy, warm and loving. He falls fast for Lake, who is impulsive, funny, a little insecure and very, very honest. She makes a living by testing artificial limbs, and her work takes her all over the world. A trip to China provides one of the BEST scenes in the whole book!! It is so hard to categorize any of Jewel E. Ann's books, they really cover all the bases and I ended up highlighting half this book. 
 ""My mouth said thank you, but my heart said I love you."" 
 Lake is quickly thrust into the world of NFL pro football and things aren't always easy. Her family makes an appearance in this book and they are always there to support her. There are some very dramatic moments in this book which provided some very unexpected and very surprising twists, as only this author can do. The supporting characters are, as always, absolutely fantastic (Flint! Hello!! Would love to read your story!!) Warm, sexy and laugh-out-loud funny, ONE is another home run from this amazing author.

Ever since 'Lick', I have been a huge fan of her witty and sexy writing. I am calling 'Twist' a friends-to-lovers story because Alex meets her ideal man online and they really do become ""friends"" even though it is through a dating site. She decides to surprise him and travels all the way to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. SURPRISE! It turns out she was not communicating with ""Eric"" but instead was really emailing with Joe, his brother. A big, sexy, lumbersexual brother. Not her type at all. Oh no. 
 ""With all the body-shaping underwear, lip gloss, heels, and tiny dress, you could almost say I'd been fibbing about who I was. His lie, however , left my Spanx and push-up bra way behind."" 
 Joe is beyond shocked to see Alex in person and her already-fragile ego takes a nose dive. One thing leads to another, and Alex decides to stay in town and realizes that Eric is actually not her type at all. It is Joe is the one who she really developed the relationship with. In all his bearded, muscled glory. Kylie Scott is a truly gifted writer and the banter banter between her characters is priceless. While we all know this story will have a happy ending, it is the journey there that is so satisfying. Alex is a real, relatable and very funny heroine, and the scenes between her and Joe are GOLD. 
 ""No more hiding or denying, sticking to the sidelines of life. It was my time to step forward and be brave. When it came to Joe Collins, I was more than ready to say yes."" 
 Alex is hilarious and warm and real and someone you would want as your best friend. The whole gang from the Dive Bar series is here plus my favorites from the Stage Dive series. BUT with that said, this is a complete standalone and you do not need to have read any of the earlier books. 
 'Twist' had plenty of steamy hot scenes and I think Joe Collins might be one of my favorite Kylie Scott characters. Joe and Alex have amazing chemistry and there is just enough angst to add the perfect amount of tension to this romance story. And all the kudos to Kylie Scott for writing a STRONG female heroine who goes after what she wants!! YES!! This is a funny, sexxxxxy, well-written and lighthearted romantic comedy. It has the perfect mix of dirty, laugh-out-loud humor and well-rounded characters. I'm booking a flight to Coeur d'Alene. 
 FAVORITE QUOTES: 
 ""When it came to Joe Collins, my pussy was a wanton whore. And seriously, who could blame it? His body was one big beautiful playground. There wasn't an inch of him I didn't want to explore."" 
 ""Basically,"" he said, voice little more than a rumble, ""with your permission, I just want to hold you down and make love to you for a good long time, watching your face as you come.""

 I really liked this book! I have never read anything by Katy Regency before and I love her style of writing. Set in the South, Ginger's Heart is a contemporary romance and a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood. The story follows Ginger, Cain and Woodman, who have known each other their whole lives. Ginger has always loved bad-boy Cain, while his cousin, Woodman, has been in love with Ginger since she was a young girl. 
 Cain knows he can't have Ginger, he is loyal to his cousin and he stays away from Ginger. Both boys enlist in the military and the story follows the three of the through the years. I love a good love triangle and even if you are not a fan, the way Katy Regency is beautiful and passionate and emotional. It is easy to see why Ginger could not really choose between Cain and Woodman. 
 Cain is the one who play the ""wolf"" role in this story, he has a good heart but he has never lived up to his family's expectations for him. He is sexy, wild and irresistible. But he is fiercely loyal to his cousin and he treats Ginger like a princess. 
 ""He was uncouth, bad mannered, irreverent, impertinent, and irresponsible, with a mouth like a sailor before he'd become a sailor, and a dick that had seen so much indiscriminate action, it's a wonder it still worked."" 
 Everyone exited Ginger to spend the rest of her life with Woodman. He is devoted to Ginger and she loves him but not the same way that she loves Cain. I really liked Woodman and was rooting for Ginger to love him! This book takes a very surprising turn near the end which I did not see coming. I absolutely loved the span of years in this book and loved watching Ginger grow up. Katy Regency makes both Cain and Woodman very sympathetic characters and the story is romantic, sexy and very emotional in some parts. 
 ""It doesn't make one of us a villain and one of us a hero. You can't help who you love. But someone's heart was goin' to break."" 
 This is a very engaging and lovely story with a very creative twist. I loved it and can't wait to read more books from Katy Regnery.

 A Thousand Boy Kisses is a lovely, poignant and sweet coming-of-age story with just the right amount of heat. Poppy and Rune are sure to become two of Tillie Cole's most beloved characters. I fell in love with both of them! 
 Kiss eight hundred and nineteen was the kiss that changed it all. The kiss that proved that a long-haired brooding boy from Norway and a quirky girl from the Deep South could find a love to rival the greats. 
 Hopefully you haven't read any spoilers for this book because I will say that the ending COMPLETELY surprised me! These two completely and totally loved each other from the time they were children. They were inseparable. Then Rune suddenly has to move away with his family, but the worst heartbreak was that Poppy cut him off with no explanation. His heart was broken. But that's not even the sad part of the book. Rune returns several years later but he is different, changed, all because of what he suffered through. 
 Poppy is devastated to realize that her treatment of Rune is what caused him to become moody and cold towards her. When she finally tells him the truth about why she cut him off, he becomes totally devoted to her. Please listen to the author's own description of this book as a ""tearjerker""! Because that's what it is. I loved Rune's absolute devotion to Poppy and her strength and bravery was beautiful. 
 This is an extremely emotional book but yet the story and the characters are incredibly engaging. I loved everything about this book, from the gorgeous cover to the story behind the thousand kisses. Grab a box of tissues and be prepared to fall in love with Poppy and Rune.

 SCORE!!!!! I knew when I read the synopsis for this book that I absolutely had to read it!! After falling in love with Liam and Kinsley in SCORING WILDER, I could not WAIT for R.S. Grey to release this sexy, funny-as-hell story about the Summer Olympic Games in Rio. Throw in a sexy British swimming superstar and a funny, beautiful, and driven soccer player, and I'm all in. 
 The Summer Games is definitely NOT just for fans of sports romance. This story is addictive, fun, enjoyable and very, very funny. R.S. Grey's one-liners are absolutely hilarious. Andie is a champion women's soccer player, in Rio for the Olympic games. She's young, fit, focused on the competition but ready to let loose in the Olympic Village. 
 ""I had to keep up my workouts and diet. Sure, I'd nearly chugged a bottle of vodka the day before, but sometimes vodka counts as medicine."" 
 Of course she was warned to stay away from bad-boy British swim champion Freddie Archibald, but Andie is just what Freddie needed in his life. He is promised to another woman, an uptight social climber to whom appearances are everything. Caroline is the opposite of Andie and Freddie has no intention of continuing with their sham ""engagement."" 
 R.S. Grey really brings in on in the romance department in this book. This is is MUCH sexier than some of her other books and I absolutely ADORED it!!! Andie and Freddie are incredible together. But will their romance continue after they have both left the Summer Games behind? 
 ""I needed her more than I needed my next race. The water was soothing, but Andie lit me on fire."" 
 I loved how strong and competitive Andie was and how she stayed laser-focused on her team and the games. And I always love a dual POV - and R.S. Grey executes the male POV perfectly here.

 Swear on This Life is one of THE best second-chance romances I've ever read. This book is perfection!!! 
 I really can't do justice to this beautiful and heart-wrenching story. This is one of those books that absolutely must be experienced by reading the author's own perfectly-crafted words. Swear on This Life is incredibly imaginative, creative and heart-stopping, and is one of my favorite books this year. 
 I finished this book months ago and have been thinking about it ever since. It is a book I have been telling all my non-bookish co-workers and friends to read. I completely tuned out the world when I read this book and wanted to spend every waking minute reading it. The past and present blend together seamlessly in this book and there are flashbacks within flashbacks. This could be confusing BUT Renee Carlino does it brilliantly here. There are really 4 main characters in this book: ""real-life"" Emiline and Jace, and ""fictional"" Emerson and Jackson. The early days of the real main characters and the fictional characters are absolutely harrowing. Emiline has now escaped her past and grown up to make a perfectly nice life for herself. She struggles, however, to find her voice as a writer. She has tried her best to put her painful past behind her, but reading the popular best-selling book featuring Emerson and Jackson has brought her childhood crashing into her present-day self in a way she is not quite ready to face. 
 ""Most of the time people who are lost don't ever find their way back."" 
 I like to be challenged as a reader and Swear on This Life did just that. It is a fascinating and unique second-chance romance like none other. At times excruciatingly painful and brutally honest, the book is also romance and women's fiction at it's very best. There is actually some humor to lighten up the overall heavy tone of the book along with an intensely sweet first love story. Emotional and satisfying, Swear on This Life is a must-read. 
 ""Some of us will look back on our lives and recall events that were a bit too perfect, but until you know the whole story, it's impossible to see the universe at work, or even admit that there is something bigger than us, making sure everything that should happen does happen.""

 L.J. Shen has written an incredibly thrilling and amazingly satsifying book. I love her writing style and can't wait to read her other books. This story grabbed me by the throat from the first word and didn't let go until the very last page. And what a beginning! Sparrow has found herself in a sudden arranged marriage to one of Boston's most notorious criminals, Troy Brennan. 
 He has a troubled past. A disastrous future. And I'm about to become a part of his present, whether I like it or not. 
 Sexy, dangerous, with not one ounce of kindess or compassion, Troy is a feared and legendary figure in Boston's crime circles. Sparrow has known of him all of her life, having grown up on the mean streets of Boston and with a father who was a low-level member of one of Troy's father gangs. Sparrow has no clue why she has been forced into this marriage because Troy seems to hate her as much as she hates him, and they both seem revolted by the idea of being married to each other. 
 ""Dear future wife..."" He smirked in a way that made me want to beg for mercy. ""If you think you're going to give me trouble, think again. I invented trouble. I stir it, I mix it, I fucking fix it. Don't try my patience, because you'll discover I have absolutely none. 
 Sparrow is feisty, resilient, smart and yes, very innocent and sheltered in many ways. She has no qualms about standing up to Troy, and he actually likes it. Sparrow is different from all the gold-digging women who are only interested in his wealth and his power. He actually kind of likes her, in his own, sick, very twisted way. But Sparrow learns quickly how to survive in her gilded cage and is thrilled when Troy agrees to let her work in one of his restaurants. 
 The sexual chemistry in this book is explosive!! Troy is the ulimtate bad boy. But what makes this book so unique is the witty sarcasm from both her main characters and the crsip and snappy dialogue. I read this book in almost one sitting and I still want more!! 
 ""I was in love with a murderer who didn't love me back, who never explained why he took me for his wife. It wasn't fine, wasn't okay, but it was the ugly, embarrassing, uncomfortable truth. Considering how fucked up my truth was, I began to understand why Troy gave me something far more convenient and beautiful. He gave me lies, and I ate them from the palm of his hand. He gave me lies, and for him, I closed my eyes. 
 This book rockets forward at a breakneck speed, with an incredible storyline that kept me guessing until the very end. There are many memorable supporting characters but Troy and Sparrow are the main focus and i kept hoping that Troy wasn't really as evil as he seemed to be. Sparrow is no pushover and I absolutely adored the ending that author gave these two. This book is one of my favorite books so far this year and it is defintely the most original. I highly recommend this story and can't wait to read more from this author!

 ""Falling in love might not have been on my list...but I'm glad I fell in love with you, Liam."" 
 I read this witty, funny, SEXXXXY, beautiful story in one sitting. Do NOT let the title scare you away! The Ending I Want is a very positive story in many ways, even though the plot is pretty much revealed early on in the book. Samantha Towle is such a capable writer that this story could have turned into a tired cliche. Instead, it is an exciting, fast-paced, immensely enjoyable book with two very memorable main characters. 
 Can we talk about Liam? At first I thought, ""Oh no, not another wealthy British businessman!"" But he is warm, smart, sensitive and ALPHA all rolled up into one perfect package. The problem is that Taylor Shaw only has plans to visit England for two very short weeks. Which means that she might have to tell Liam about the secret that she is trying not-so-successly to hide from him. 
 ""I would have stayed because I'm pretty sure I was in love with you from the moment you surprise-kissed me on the plane. You had me instantly."" 
 The Ending I Want is not overly-sentimental or sappy. Instead it is the perfect mix of humor, hope and love. I absolutely loved this unexpectedly beautiful story. Oh, and The Mighty Storm fans - watch for an appearance by Jake Wethers!!

Sinners Creed excited me, stunned me, shocked me and yes, even made me cry. Which is not an easy feat. Even if you've read a lot of MC books, this book will surprise you and thrill you and I can't recommend it highly enough. 
 This is an unwavering, no-holds-barred look into club life, with all of the violence, sex and raw emotion you can imagine. Brotherhood comes before all else, and these men will sacrifice everything for their brothers. Dirk is no exception: he has become a notorious enforcer, a nomad, who travels wherever Club business takes him, always alone, always doing what needs to be done, no matter what the price. 
 Saylor comes into his life quite by accident, and gradually, slowly, they develop a deep and loving bond. Dirk has lived a sad, brutal life, and Saylor finally is something good in his life. Saylor is running from something, and Dirk agrees to take her on his travels across the country. 
 It is best if you go into this book without knowing too much detail about the plot. I knew nothing about this book when I started reading it. It turns out that Saylor loves to ride, and really, she is the only joyful part of Dirk's violent existence. This book took a very surprising turn which was perfect for these two characters. Some will love it, some will not, but take a chance on Sinner's Creed and go on the Dirk and Saylor's journey with them. This book was magical, gritty, raw and beautiful all at once.

 WOW!!! As a jaded romance reader, I am rarely taken by surprise by books that I read. Well, FLY WITH ME took me by surprise from the first page! This sexxxxy and emotional story grabbed my heart and didn't let go. Handsome fighter pilot? Check. Smart, curvy, sweet heroine? Check. Two older characters who have dated a lot and know what they want and go after it? CHECK!!! 
 This is the first book in the new Wild Aces series and follows a group of fighter pilots. I fell in love with Noah and his passion for flying and his devotion to his country. These men put their duties first and it isn't easy to have a family with their schedules. Noah has never been tied down before until he meets Jordan in Las Vegas art her sister's bachelorette party. She is just looking for a night of fun from her quiet life as a store owner back in Florida. 
 How often could you say that you could pinpoint the exact moment when your life changed? 
 What makes this book different is the vivid portrayal of both Noah and Jordan's points of view. Noah is mouth-wateringly gorgeous, Alpha, smart and he wants Jordan. Jordan is smart, funny, and open, and Noah finds himself instantly attracted. 
 But what happens after a torrid night in Vegas? Will Noah go back to his base in Oklahoma and Jordan home to Florida? I absolutely loved how these two struggled to figure out how to make their blossoming relationship work. There is something about an older hero and heroine that really gets to me. I appreciate their honesty and their passion. I read this book in one sitting and wanted more. I laughed, I cried, I was turned on...this book has it all. I am so glad I took a chance on a new-to-me-author. FLY WITH ME is a winner and I can't recommend this book highly enough!!

 This place is like the Garden of Eden. Beautiful but full of danger. 
 There was SO much to love about this book! Ella, the feisty, smart and sarcastic survivor. The sex, lust, and dirty talk. The fast-moving storyline. I really liked this book a lot but the over-the-top teen drama, the cruelty and the unecessary theatrics got in the way from making this a homerun for me. 
 Elle Kennedy and Jen Frederick (the pair behind Erin Watt) are amazingly talented and gifted writers. Their writing talent made this book a TOTAL guilty pleasure, with a very likeable and resilient heroine and TONS of hot and heavy lust and sex. Ella Harper finds herself suddenly living in a world of almost unimaginable wealth and privilege after Callum Royal, her father's old friend, becomes her legal guardian. She is a poor girl who did what she had to support herself and get through high school. Suddenly, she is enrolled in private school and living in a house filled with Callum's sons, who are resentful of her, to say the least. They are on a mission to destroy her, and to make her leave. Despite their taunts and their endless bullying, she refuses to leave and is only after one thing: to finish high school and go to college. 
 ""You should get away from here. These Royals will ruin you."" 
 Oh but there's the little detail of Reed Royal. The meanest of them all (and that's saying a lot), he and Ella hate each other at first sight but then can't stay away from each other. Even though I disliked Reed at the beginning, he began to grow on me and I could see how Ella eventually found him irresistible: 
 ""He has everything a girl could want: the hard body, the handsome face that will still look good years from now, the money, and that extra something. Charisma, I guess. The ability to slay you with a single look. The apple is dangling in front of me, juicy red and delicious, but, like the fairy tale, Reed Royal is the villain disguised as a pretty prince. Taking a bite out of him would be a huge mistake. 
 The Royals run the school and everyone there follows their orders. This book reminded me a lot of Beverly Hills 90210 and Gossip Girl. There is no question that this story is unputdownable. I just would have liked less cruelty and a little more reality. Nonetheless, I will most DEFINITELY read the next book because this one ends on quite the cliffhanger! I really do want to see what is next for Ella Harper.

 ""I'll fight for us, but I'll need you to fight too."" 
 JB Salsbury has written a classic friends-to-lovers story, with two characters that I loved from her previous books. Killian and Axelle have been best friends since childhood, but Kill is not your typical bad-boy MMA fighter. He's a nerd in high school, and worships Axelle from afar. He thinks she could never be interested in someone like him, a geek who wears glasses, quiet and nerdy. Axelle, who has bad terrible choices in men, secretly loves him, but she doesn't feel worthy enough for the smart, driven Killian. 
 There is more emotion, sexual tension and heartbreak packed into this book then many books twice the size. I could not put this book down and this story touched me on so many levels that I am still thinking about it a week after finishing! I fell in love with Killian. He is now my favorite of all the Fighting boys. Sweet, sexy, protective, strong, gentle - he is the TOTAL package. 
 And Axelle is a fantastic heroine, she makes bad choices, is far from perfect but picks herself up and moves on and makes a better life for herself. She realizes early on that she can't hold Killian back from a stellar fighting career and refuses to hold him back. 
 ""I can't lose him to someone else. But I can't allow him to pass up on a chance at happiness with someone else either."" 
 Axelle and Killian's story is emotional, thrilling, sexy, filled with heartbreak, hope and promise. 
 This book was perfect in every way. The boy and girl secretly in love with each other, the years spent apart, the incredible sexual chemistry between the hero and heroine, and the beautiful and strong families who support them both unconditionally. I adored how the author allowed Axelle to overcome her insecurities and become her own woman. I love everything JB Salsbury writes but FIGHTING FATE is one of her very best books!I didn't think it possible, but I have become an even bigger fan after reading FIGHTING FATE. The dual POV was perfection and I can't wait for more books from Ms. Salsbury.

This is part of the Rugby series but can absolutely be read as a standalone. This book is NOT your typical sports romance! It features a gorgeous ruby star who surprisingly, needs to learn some skills in the bedroom! This is a very funny and VERY sexy take on a familiar theme and I enjoyed every word of this story. 
 Lucy is the sister of a star rugby player. She is quirky, different and has a very unusual way of dealing with anxiety - she has a compulsion to shoplift. Not so easy to hide when the media is lurking everywhere. At first she dislikes Sean, her brother's teammate, but beneath his bad-boy reputation is a kind, generous and loving soul. 
 ""Beauty comes in many forms, and the strong, powerful kind is the most admirable. It's easy to be weak; you simply do nothing, but strength takes courage and effort."" 
 Sean has his own issues to deal with. He doesn't seem interested in proving his teammates wrong about his cocky reputation and his family is not exactly warm and fuzzy. Lucy is afraid of alienating her brother if he finds out that she and Sean are seeing each other, so they agree to keep their romance a secret at first. Lucy is going to teach Sean how to be a better lover - I LOVED how they did NOT start off with spectacular sex!! But Sean is so sweet and is a very, very good student. He begins to develop real feelings for Lucy and she begins to fall for Sean, too. 
 ""I don't want to close my eyes when I could be looking at you"" 
 The Player and the Pixie is a sweet, funny and totally fresh story. I absolutely adored Lucy and Sean and the very unique storyline. These two are very memorable characters and I highly recommend this book even if you are not usually a fan of sports romance!

 Refreshingly funny and SOOO sexy!! Kyle Scott is laugh-out-loud funny. 
 DIRTY is a fantastic start to a new series from Kylie Scott. The book starts off with a bang and doesn't let up until the very end. Lydia has run away from her own wedding, climbing over a fence and right into an empty house. Except that the owner is there and is very surprised to find a runaway bride in his own bathroom, distraught and still in her wedding gown. 
 ""Even with no clothing to take cues from, the dude was clearly the epitome of cool. He looked about my age, or maybe a little older. He had longish red-blond hair, dark blue eyes set in an angular face, a lean but muscular torso covered in tattoos, and a rather large cock. Not that I meant to check him out, it's just kind of hard to ignore a penis and scrotum when they're dangling right in front of your face. I tilted my head, trying to get some perspective. Every viewpoint, however, was equally shocking. There was dick as far as the eye could see. 
 And I should stop ogling him. Right."" 
 This was supposed to be Lydia's wedding day and she is, to put it mildly, distraught. But she still maintains her sense of humor even in the face of a cheating ex-fiancee and his overbearing family. Vaughan is a nice guy and offers to let Lydia stay with him until she is able to get back on her feet. Even though he probably shouldn't trust a woman who has broken into his house, he likes her and her curves and her smart mouth. 
 ""You touch any of my stuff?"" he asked. ""Take anything?"" 
 ""Yes, your sofa is cunningly hidden down the front of my dress. You won't believe where I fit the TV."" 
 Again, his eyes narrowed dangerously. ""Between you and me, probably not the time to be funny, babe."" 
 Lydia finds herself working at the local Dive Bar with Vaughan and his family and friends. Lydia grows to love the Idaho town she has found herself in and can see herself making a life there and putting down roots. Vaughan, however, is a different story. He is chasing dreams of being a musician and isn't ready to give that up. He and Lydia really like each other but neither one is ready for anything serious, so, they agree to a friends-with-benefits arrangement. . . which, of course, means at least one of them is going to fall in love. Hey, this IS a romance, after all!! And who can resist Vaughan? 
 ""Clearly, there were far more northern Idaho sex gods than I'd given the region credit for. Further classifications were going to be required. If Vaughan topped the super-cool category, then maybe this new guy should win on the lumbersexual front. Given my abrupt return to singledom, I'd have to give this important man-classification system more thought. 
 Disclaimer: Objectifying people is wrong and stuff."" 
 DIRTY is a fun and funny, sexy, warm-hearted romance that hits all the right notes. There is no unnecessary drama and lots of fantastic, interesting supporting characters. I adored everything about this book. Ms. Scott is one of my favorite contemporary romance authors and I can't wait to read the next book in this series!! 
 ""When his lips opened a little, just enough to softly kiss my bottom lip, I swear I swooned. Over and over he kissed my lips, first the top then the bottom, the sides and the corner from where my smile started. No part was left untouched. My smile grew wider, my nipples hard and my loins Vaughan-addled. That's a medical term.""

THE LIE is told in flashback, and we see the beginnings of their love story through the present day. This is a gorgeous second-chance romance, which had me on pins and needles from the first paragraph. 
 Brigs is a tortured soul and I wasn't quite sure how the author was going to bring him together with Natasha. She barely escaped their break-up with her sanity intact and can't even begin to think about him being in her life again. Everything about Brigs is simply too painful for Natasha to deal with. 
 ""Memories of love are a poison. My therapist told me that I have to embrace it. Acknowledge that people fall in love all the time with people they aren't supposed to, that I was swept away and lost control for once in my life..."" 
 Brigs lives with crushing guilt for what happened to his family, but Natasha was the love of his life. What will he do now that she is in his life again? I was rooting for them from the beginning and read their story in one sitting. The writing is incredibly beautiful, soulful and passionate. 
 ""Tell me what I am to you,"" he whispers, leaning in closer. I suck in my breath. Afraid that if I exhale I'll let all my secrets loose.

Breathtaking romance, redemption, suspense, a sly sense of humor... this entire series just knocked the wind out of me!! This book was the perfect ending to the tale of Jackson and Jillian and all of the characters that I've grown to love through the course of three books. 
 Jillian Knight has become one of my favorite heroines ever. Damaged, feisty, strong-willed, smart and sarcastic, I was praying for her to have a happy ending!! And her unbreakable bond with her brother was absolutely brilliant. 
 ""In so many ways the greatest love story of her life was not with Luke or AJ ... it was with Jackson. He was the constant in her life. His love defined unconditional. Someday she would tell him ... someday."" 
 These two characters managed to fight their way out of almost unimaginable circumstances and both fought to find normalcy and happiness and love. That sounds sappy but there is not one false moment in this book and the author's writing literally took my breath away!! I could not put his story down until I found out what would happen to Jackson, Jillian, Ryn and Luke. Be wanted that there is graphic violence in this book, but it fit in with the storyline and the characters and it never felt gratuitous. 
 ""Control never lasted. Eventually the illusion of time, the pull of gravity, and catastrophic events reminded everyone of their mortality and their utter insignificance in the great big world. Life was nothing more than one long blink. Here today. Gone tomorrow."" 
 I have not binge-read a series of books in a very long time. This series was an exception, and I wish I could read these books all over again for the first time!! I ""ADORE"" this author and can't wait to read her other books.

 A gorgeously written, passionate and lyrical story. My heart is singing!I fell in love with Rose and Damon and all of the supporting characters in this book. SHOWMANCE is set in the world of musical theatre in London and centers around a production of Moulin Rouge. Rose is an assistant choreographer and lives and breathes dancing. But she is content to leave the spotlight to others, having suffered from stage fright most of her life. Enter Damon Atwood, a reclusive superstar who stepped away from the public spotlight at the height of his fame after years spent in a quiet fishing town. Damon will bring star power to the production and is paired with the gorgeous actress Alicia, who plays his co-star in the show. Rose instantly feels tremendous empathy for Damon, who is almost painfully shy in public but comes alive when singing and acting on the stage. 
 ""You have no idea the kind of betrayal I've suffered in my life... This friendship I have with you is a big deal. I haven't let someone into my life like I have you in years."" 
 SHOWMANCE is a very slow-burn romance, filled with stolen moments and tons of steamy, Alpha heat. Rose has sown off dating actors after being burned in past relationships. But Damon sees the beautiful soul that she is and can't help but fall in love with her. Although Damon is closed-off and shy in public, when he is alone with Rose, OMG!!! Their scenes together are absolutely unforgettable. 
 In a heartbeat, every look we'd shared flashed through my mind, from that initial fleeting glance across the dance studio the first time I'd heard him sing, to this one. This one told me I owned his heart, his soul, his everything. 
 This story has all the elements that I love: a smart and strong heroine, a damaged, sensitive hero and a creative, interesting plot. I loved the behind-the-scenes look into theatre production and the FANTASTIC cast of supporting characters, especially Rose's best friend Julian. I am THRILLED that Julian is getting his own book!!! I can't wait to see what the author does with this character. I could go on and on about this book, it is that perfect. L.H. Cosway is a brilliant writer and I devoured this book. It has the perfect mix of sexy, steamy scenes and just the right amount of angst. Don't miss this one!!!

 Just when I thought another Kristen Ashley hero could not break my heart any more than her earlier heroes, along comes Deke Hightower. A loner, almost a recluse, a man of very few words (the original strong, silent type!), Deke has had a hard, tough life, never putting down roots anywhere and never, ever opening his heart to a woman. He is a simple man, a lover of his bike and the open road, which he makes VERY clear to everyone he meets. Deke and Justice have a history together (he just doesn't remember it!!) but when they meet again years later, they have a verrrry slow build-up, and the slow burn worked perfectly for these two. There are lots of misunderstandings, lots of miscommunications, but when these two get together....OMG!!!! Expect the usual HAWTNESS and over-the-top Alpha-male sexiness that is pure Kristen Ashley. 
 One of the things I absolutely adored about this book was Deke. He is no kid (and neither is Justice), and Kristen Ashley describes him as all man and then some. 
 ""...All of it covering exceptional pecs and the most amazing stomach I'd ever seen. 
 Not abs. 
 A manly stomach. 
 I had to admit, I was over the cut leanness that was all the rage. In the beginning, it was hot. But now it seemed daunting, men being so developed they didn't have an inch of extra flesh on them, not like they were human beings but like they were diagrams of a body's muscularity. 
 Not Deke."" 
 *FAINTS* And Justice, I loved her! She is a gifted musician, with a renowned family but with lots and lots of heartache to go along with that. But this is Carnal and she is trying to hide out and get some peace. She hires Deke to renovate her new house and I think that Kristen Ashley must have a second secret career as a contractor. At first I thought there was too much detail about the house renovations but then I fell in love with the wonderful detail. Deke works with his hands, he takes pride in his work and the contrast between his blue-collar background and Justice's upbringing is both perfect and poignant at the same time. She has plenty of craziness to deal with, which Deke doesn't get at first. He really closes off his heart and Justice at first hides the fact that she remembers him from years before. He is almost sullen, but all of it comes from a place of heartbreak. 
 ""My life, babe,"" he shook his head, ""until I was about twenty, it was not good."" ""Okay,"" I prompted carefully, not liking that. ""And because a' that, I got a way I gotta be and that's a way that's not gonna change."" 
 > 
 All Justice wants is love and acceptance and some peace in her life. I loved that she was always herself around Deke, and eventually he warmed up to her cheerfulness, honesty and just plain goodness. It is difficult for a man like Deke to be with a brilliant and successful woman like Justice. But Deke, being Deke, accepts this in his own way. 
 He squatted and reached into the bag. 
 ""Open a beer for me, yeah?"" 
 ""I live to serve."" 
 Deke wanted to test that but do it when they were both naked. 
 Fuck him. 
 Total dumbfuck. 
 I must mention that FANTASTIC cast of secondary characters here. Each and every one felt fully developed and essential to the story. In my opinion, Kristen Ashley can pretty much write about anything and I will devour it. But when she writes about two people who have already lived a full life, who have their own demons and pasts, and who know what they want, well, to me that's a winner. Welcome back to Carnal, folks, it is a beautiful place. Enjoy the bounty. 
 ""I was living it and all I had to do was take care of it, nurture it, make it stronger. 
 Then it always would be mine. 
 Everything I'd ever wanted. 
 My place in this universe. 
 And it felt amazing.""

 NAZ IS BACK and wicked as ever. 
 I am in love with this series!!! The author continues to surprise by showing a ""little"" softer side of Naz here. Just a little. He is still as ruthless as ever but he remains fiercely loyal to Karissa. He stuggles to break free of his violent past for Karissa's sake, but let's face it, it is obvious he will never be completely free of that world. For that reason, I was on the edge of my seat throughout this whole book, just waiting for the other shoe to drop. 
 ""He wants to be a better man to ease my guilt for loving someone like him."" 
 This is a fast-moving, thrilling and violent plot, but completely and utterly sexy at the same time. Naz is absolutely one of THE sexiest, most controlling anti-heroes and I love him!!! This series is a must-read for fans of Mafia romance. It is tighly written, fast-paced, totally sexy and has great supporting characters. There is lots going on in this book and obviously the series must be read in order or there will be major spoilers.

 HIDDEN BODIES begins where where YOU ended. For those of you who do not like cliffies, YOU wasn't really a cliffhanger and can absolutely be read as a standalone. However, for someone like me who is obsessed with Joe Goldberg (and a little bit in love with him? Weird, I know), I was thrilled that there was more to this story. 
 As funny as the author's commentary on NYC life was, she is even funnier and more on-point with her look at living in L.A. Don't fear, Joe is still as crazy as ever, but in an almost ""Being There"" fashion, everyone around him seems to mold him into what they believe him to be. 
 And Joe is trying. He really is. But is still a complete and total sociopath. Despite that, I was really rooting for him to find true love in HIDDEN BODIES. But everyone is just so phony and materialistic and so Joe really believes he is justified in his actions. This story is just as addictive and readable as YOU, and will keep you on the edge of your seat, terrified but yet laughing out loud. Scary, funny, heartbreaking and amazing.

I want to claim her apprehension, dread, and uncertainty. I want to take ownership of all of her emotions and be the sole reason she trembles and cries."" 
 With those words, Pam Godwin has written on my favorite student-teacher dark romances. DARK NOTES is in the same category as UNTEACHABLE by Leah Raeder, with the rapid, short sentence style and the hopeless, yet hopeful, heroine. But Mr. Emeric Marceaux in in a class by himself (pun intended!) with his dark, dangerous and commanding nature. He knows what he wants and will do anything to make that happen. 
 Ivory is a feisty, but dirt-poor music student who is out of her element at the expensive and elitist music school she attends. She is a senior and is trying desperately to make it to graduation so that she can secure a spot at a prestigious music academy. But she is the poorest student at the school, forced to do anything to survive. She barely has money for new shoes or the school uniform, let alone textbooks or the required tablet. 
 Emeric is one commanding and bossy man. Whew. I thought I knew what I was getting into with this book but my God, this man is irresistible. He never, ever mistreats Ivory, unlike most of the other men in her life, and his heart literally aches for the proud student who refuses to take charity from anyone. 
 ""All you need is a moment...This brutal man is my home. His hell is my heaven. I'm his Ivory, and he's my darkest note."" 
 Emeric became obsessed with Ivory and although he knew he had to stay away, they were both immediately connected and believe me, this girl needed his protection in the worst way. I love Emeric and was completely invested in him and his need to protect Ivory. This is without a doubt one of the sexiest forbidden love stories I've ever read. 
 There is a fantastic, brutal, emotional and violent storyline that is pure Pam Godwin. The New Orleans setting is perfection, and having lived there for many years, I am always thrilled when an author gets the setting of the story just right. New Orleans is almost another character in this book, with its humidity, class system, funky neighborhoods and diverse music scene. 
 Ivory is a feisty, strong heroine who will do whatever she needs to survive in her brutal world. She is no virginal, innocent heroine but she does have a refreshing honesty that I loved. Pam Godwin continues to be my go-to author for dark romance and DARK NOTES is just one more forbidden romance that hits all the right notes.

 Logan is a porn star but he really loves his job and makes no apologies for what he does. I loved the behind the scenes look into the porn industry and found it fascinating. Logan has had his heart broken by another adult film star but he has fantasized for years about Devi, who he met on set. Can two porn actors find true love together when their jobs involve having sex with other people? 
 Believe it or not, this book is actually full of romance along with the amazingly hot sex scenes and dirty talk. Logan is actually very sweet and Devi is filled with dreams of going back to school and maybe, just maybe, having a ""real"" relationship with Logan. They make a reality-tv type of film together which follows them as they pretend ""date"" but they both begin to fall for each other. The lines between their series and reality quickly become blurred. This book is filled with surprises and even has some very funny moments. I love both of these authors and their first book together is hot, sweet and a total guilty pleasure.

 I will admit I did not think I would love this book as much as I did!! I am a HUGE fan of Alessandra Torre's writing, but I really thought this story might be a little too ""fluffy"" for me. I was completely wrong!! It is sexxxxxy, fun, sarcastic, witty and a love letter to New York City. The formatting of the book is gorgeous and very, very clever. 
 Chloe lived a pampered life as part of New York City's wealthy elite. As an NYU student, she never had worry about such trivial things as money or tuition. All of that comes to a screeching halt when her parents lose everything after being assessed of insider trading. But Chloe is nothing if not resourceful and finds a job as a personal assistant to a spoiled, mean and self-centered socialite, who also thinks of herself as an actress. 
 ""The wealth of the city lived in a different bubble than the rest of us. One where there were no worries of minor problems, the majority of which were easily solved by money. One comprised of beautiful women, powerful men, the drug of success heavy in the air, punctuated by diamond, caviar, and ego. For the first time, I was an outsider..."" 
 Alessandra Torre writes some of my favorite books. She can be dark, twisty, and imaginative, and Love, Chloe shows what a versatile writer she is. This is a light, funny, romantic, fast-paced story, but with so many clever touches, that I enjoyed it immensely. Each chapter begins with an Instagram picture that were a perfect addition to the story. They set the tone for the next chapter and what was going on in Chloe's life. 
 This is a standalone novel and it delves not only into the world of New York City socialites, but also into the making of a movie, A-List and B-List actors and trying to survive in the Big City. Chloe has had to grow up fast and complicating things is her old boyfriend who keeps making unwanted appearances in the new life she is trying to make for herself. 
 Maybe the cultured, confident woman I was before was just a product of my parents' money. Maybe now, with my new life a train wreck, I would discover the real Chloe Madison. 
 And maybe, I wouldn't like her. 
 Maybe it wasn't too late for me. 
 Maybe all this was just my wakeup call. 
 Chloe finally finds an apartment that she can afford on her own, now that she is gainfully employed, and wouldn't you know it, she has a HOT super who just turns out to be a NICE guy on top of all that hotness!! And of course you know that you will be treated to some SIZZLING sex scenes. Carter is a total doll and it is obvious he really likes Chloe. I loved that she was insecure, that she really ended up being a hard worker, that she did the ""right thing"" in the end (you'll see what I mean) and that Alessandra Torre gives her a happy ending that she deserves. Does she ALWAYS make the right choices? No. But Love, Chloe is a little ""slice-of-life"" very modern book that is immensely enjoyable. The author continues to surprise with her ability to write across different genres. If you are looking for a very fast-paced book with humor, heart and tons of steam, Love, Chloe is defintely for you!

 There is so much to love about this book! The heroine is funny, feisty, different, and not afraid to be herself. The dialogue is sharp and Graham is devlishly sexy. The story begins with a creative premise: a lost cellphone on a train. Our heroine Soraya and Graham immediately clash when she goes to his offices to return his phone. He is a total asshole at work but he loves that she argues with him and isn't afraid of him at all. 
 Soraya works for an advice columnist, doesn't love her job and has not had a successful sex life. She rides the train to and from work every day from her apartment in Brooklyn and that is how she first spots Graham. But these two could not more different! 
 ""My life was far from Sex and the City. It was more like Sex and the Pity. Or Sex and the Shitty."" 
 There are lots of funny one-liners in this story and the plot is very fast-paced. Graham loves that Soraya is pierced and dyes the tips of her hair in wild colors. Different from the stuffy women he has been with in the past. I loved the major twist in the middle of this book: it injected lots of emotion and heart into this story. 
 I loved the New York City setting but several unrealistic plot points interefered with my enjoyment of the story. These authors are wonderful at creating memorable characters and Stuck-Up Suit is no exception. The chemistry is explosive and the sexy times are very, very hot. 
 ""It would be my pleasure to leave the gentleman at the door and fuck you four ways dirty."" 
 This book is perfect if you want a sexy, funny, fast-paced contemporary romance that offers an escape from reality for a few hours. And kudos to Ms. Ward and Ms. Keeland for creating a heroine who marches to the beat of her own drummer!

 Sweetly smart romance with a magnificent hockey-playing hero! Who wouldn't fall in love with Tucker? 
 This sexy NA/Sports Romance series was just what I needed to read right now: fast-paced, funny, light, with just the right touch of sweetness and steam. Tucker was a doll: a good boy who really loved Sabrina and wanted to stand by her no matter what when a surprise pregnancy interrupts their no-strings-attached relationship. Tucker was a fabulous hockey player with a bright future ahead of him but like Sabrina, he knows what he wants, too, and he goes after it. 
 Sabrina has her goals set in stone: attend Harvard Law and then go on to work in a large, prestigious law firm. She works multiple jobs, studies hard and doesn't have much time for anything else. Her home life is the pits and she can't wait to get far away from her family. Tucker and Sabrina were perfect together! The steam factor is off the charts in this book!! 
 ""Oh sweet baby Jesus. Sex with Tucker is dirtier and hotter than I thought it would be. He doesn't look like he'd be this way, but isn't it always the quiet ones?"" 
 Tucker was patient, yet a bit stalker-ish (thank God!) and overall, 'The Goal' is another wonderfully-written story from Elle Kennedy. And the cover!! Hello, abs!! The secondary characters are strong and I loved seeing the characters from the earlier books here. With that said, you do not need to have read the earlier books in the series to love and enjoy 'The Goal'. I loved the message here and the Epilogue was soooo sweet! Thanks, Elle, for another sexy couple in the Off-Camput Series!

 WELL HELLO, GRUMPY BEARDED FARMER!! Sarina Bowen NEEDS to write more adult contemporary romance! OMG Griffin is one of THE sweetest and sexiest heroes EVER. Adored the story. Sexy, funny and smart. Fabulous beginning to what I'm sure will be a fantastic series!! 
 I absolutely loved this story about Griff, a super-hot and always-grumpy farmer who lives and works with his large family on their farm in Vermont. I loved the wonderful details about apple farming, organic farming and the agricultural business!! This eye for detail just shows what an incredibly talented writer Sarina Bowen is. 
 Audrey is struggling to make her mark in the Boston restaurant world and is called upon to visit several farms in Vermont as part of her job. She runs into Griif, with whom she had a few hot hook-ups in college. Back then he was a superstar football player, but he thought she was a sorority party girl and she thought he would never be interested in someone like her. 
 Flash forward to the present, Audrey is trying to make it on her own without the help of her wealthy mother. Her bosses aren't exactly ethical in their business dealings, which Griff makes quite clear to her. BUT these two have some AMAZINGLY hot chemistry and can't seem to stay away from each other. I must say that Sarina Bowen surprised me with the heat level in BITTERSWEET!!! Griff is hot, sweet, huge and BEARDED. Audrey is hooked! But these two could not be more different: Griff is serious, usually grumpy and completely immersed in running his farm and the business side of farming, while Audrey, who is smart and driven, is funny, outgoing and much more of a people person. 
 ""You're the sweet that balances out my natural tannins."" 
 Griff is my kind of hero. Hardworking, sexy, sweet, devoted to his family...and when he opens up to Audrey and shows his true feelings, OMG!!! Perfection. 
 ""There was nothing I wouldn't have given her at that moment. Skin to skin with her was the only place I wanted to be."" 
 There is an incredible cast of supporting characters, I would love to read a story about each and every one. BITTERSWEET has humor, heat, wonderful writing and and a fast paced story. And plenty of sexy times to satisfy even the most jaded of contemporary romance readers (like me!) The only thing that kept this book from being a 5 star read for me was a scene early on that I felt was out of place in a sexy contemporary romance story. Other than that, I highly recommend this sweet, sexy and funny story!! Can't wait to read the next book in this series!!

 I could not. Put. This. Book. Down. Simply out, this book grabbed me from the beginning and I haven't been able to stop thinking about Emily and Reeve since I finished. FIRST TOUCH is without a doubt one of my favorite books of the year. It is stunning and a true page-turner! 
 The plot, the pacing, the hotter-than-hot sex scenes, the emotion, the characters...all pure perfection. I love Laurelin Paige's writing but with FIRST TOUCH, she has written the best book of her career. Run, don't walk, to buy this book! 
 I absolutely love a damaged heroine when written well. Emily is an incredibly real, thoughtful, smart and beautiful woman, who lived a very fast and dangerous lifestyle when she was young. Her ""partner in crime"" was her best friend Amber, with whom she lost touch but who has now reached out to Emily. Amber represents a part of Emily's past that she'd like to put behind her, but Emily is forced into using her beauty and charm once again in order to seduce the man she believes might hold the clues to Amber's whereabouts. 
 ""Men were my drug. Staying away from them had been the only way I knew to stay clean. The only way to reinvent myself."" 
 Amber has disappeared, is somehow in danger and Emily feels she owes it to Amber to help her. Amber did the same for Emily many times when they were younger, and Emily senses that Amber needs her now. To that end, Emily sets her sights on wealthy hotelier Reeve, who might be the only link she has to Amber. Reeve, it seems, is only interested in a purely sexual arrangement with the alluring Emily. But Emily can't help but fall for the hot, yet emotionally reserved playboy. 
 ""His grip was strong and sure and aggressive. Almost too tight, but just barely not. He held it without saying anything for several seconds, and, I don't know how-- somehow, though-- I knew he was making his own allusion. His own promise. He wanted me to know what he'd be like. In bed. With me. He'd be powerful and controlling and forceful, even. Almost too forceful, but just barely not. Was that how he'd been with her? Did almost become too much?"" 
 This book is part erotic romance, part thriller, part romantic suspense...FIRST TOUCH has it all. There are some VERY graphic sex scenes in this book and the steam factor is off the charts!! But there is much more to this story than just the erotic elements. My heart absolutely ached for the suffering Emily had endured; and I was literally holding my breath in anticipation throughout the story, hoping against hope that she and Reeve would develop real feelings for each other, beyond their agreed-upon sexual arrangement. Emily's pretend seduction of Reeve quickly turns into something more and she knows that Reeve represents the possibility of a real connection, real feelings, but he is hiding many secrets of his own. 
 ""Because the only thing worse than falling under Reeve's spell would be me believing that he'd fallen under mine as well."" 
 There is a large cast of characters in FIRST TOUCH - some might be dangerous, some might not be, and some might know what happened to Amber. One thing is for sure, nothing is as it seems in FIRST TOUCH. And that is what makes this such an outstanding story.

 This is the very sexy and very sweet sequel to the short story, Hearts in Darkness. This book picks up shortly after Caden and Makenna first met in the darkened elevator. They have developed an almost-perfect relationship - and this book is verra verra steamy - but Caden has severe PTSD due to a very shocking incident in his past that has completely traumatized him. 
 This is one of those stories where the hero doesn't think he is good enough for the heroine - she is smart, kind, beautiful, has a wonderful family, etc. - so the hero must distance himself from her ""for her own good."" Makenna loves Caden but realizes that he is gun-shy and she is scared to make her true feelings known. When she does, all hell breaks loose. 
 This is a lovely, steamy story with lots of angst and a beautiful HEA. If you are a fan of Laura Kaye's writing, then you will love this book.

 I am personally a fan of love triangles in books - I know, a little strange, but I love the emotion, the forbidden-love aspect and and the thrill of it all. So if you are not a fan, then this book is probably not for you. Sadie has been married to an amazing man who has suddenly and inexplicably shut down. Nathan has stopped communicating with Sadie, seems to not want her anymore, and pretty much just shuts her out. She tries to get through to him, to no avail. Enter sexy neighbor Finn, who is smart, sweet, and makes his intentions very clear from the start. 
 I have LOVED this author's writing ever since I read her Cityscape series (which I highly recommend.) Ms. Hawkins made me FEEL Sadie's insecurities, her inner battles and her fear of losing her husband and I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster from the first page of this book. This is a very adult and very passionate book where not all is black-and-white. Yes, Nathan seems perfect and yes, Sadie makes some mistakes, but she is human and I found the story to be very believable. I loved Finn and could see why Sadie was so conflicted. She love her husband but feels like her marriage is over. All of the characters in this book are incredibly well written and I connected with them from the start. 
 Finn and Sadie have explosive chemistry AND so do Sadie and Nathan! The sex scenes are absolutely incredible. I loved everything about this book and loved the conclusion. Kudos to Jessica Hawkins for another incredibly sexy and addictive story.

Jen Frederick has a gift for sparkling dialogue and nuanced characters that elevate her books to the top of the sports-romance genre. This story is funny, fast-paced and shows off the author's deep love and knowledge of the sport of football. Lucy and Matty are adorable and the sex scenes were waaaaay steamier than I expected. And the banter between these two is priceless! 
 ""I know how to cook, and have, at some points in my life, operated an iron."" He ticks off each skill on a finger. ""I always bring the good booze when I'm invited to a party, and I make my bed in the morning."" 
 ""You had me at know how to cook."" 
 Who doesn't love a gorgeous, smart athlete who's also senstive, depsite his party-boy reputation? Matty is one of the author's most endearing characters. Lucy is hilarious, and her inner dialogue is pure gold. 
 The girls must have spotted Matt because they bypass three open tables to walk by ours. As they pass, there's a contest of who can flip her hair over her shoulder the hardest. I swear the last two eye fuck him so hard, it's a wonder they make it to their own table upright. 
 There's a very sweet twist to this story, and I found the peek into the inner workings of a college football team fascinating. If you want a well-written, fresh college romance, without unrealistic and unecessary drama, pick up JOCKBLOCKED. It is part of an internconnected series but can defintely be read as a standalone. And be prepared for Matty to steal your heart!! 
 He watches me while I pull on my coat. ""You're right that there's nothing wrong with how you're living. I'm not judging that. I'm just saying maybe your life could be happier. And that sometimes taking a risk gives you big rewards."" 
 ""And you're that big reward?""

 WOW!!!! There are lots of contemporary erotic romances out there but Nikki Sloane has quickly become one of my favorite authors in the genre. Regan and Silas burn up the pages in THREE DIRTY SECRETS!!!! Silas is just, well, irresistible. A hunky, smart, artistic, and Alpha tattoo artist?? Sign me up. 
 This isn't the tired old girl-meets-guy, girl-loses-guy, girl-gets-guy back story. Regan is working as an undercover FBI agent in the Blindfold Club, which is really a side story to the main event of her sizzling romance with Silas Getty. She is an aggressive cop and Silas is aggressive, too, so what to do with that?! Nikki Sloane wraps it all up pretty nicely in this steamy, sexy story. 
 ""We had heat by the truckload, but this was something else. Passion. So different, and so much better."" 
 Regan is still reeling from a prior undercover operation gone wrong so she is distant with Silas, reserved in her emotions but he is passionate and loves that Regan is a tough-talking, no-nonsense woman. She is afraid of falling for him but quickly that he might just be THE perfect man for her. 
 ""I'd failed all of my objectives when it came to Silas.. . and I hadn't outlined any ground rules about keeping things between us casual. Last Sunday had been anything but casual."" 
 THREE DIRTY SECRETS is as much of a romantic suspense as it is a BDSM-themed book, the action is fast-paced and the sex scenes are absolutely incendiary. This book is for mature readers only!! There are threesomes that are scorching hot and main characters who are passionate, driven and not afraid to take what they want. I highly recommend this story, it is another winner in the Blindfold Club Series!!

 Cardeno C. is one of my favorite authors. Her books always contain a perfect mix of spicy and sweet, and the heat level is always just perfect for me. Her stories are always interesting, sometimes poignant, but never fail to contain a ton of heart so I absolutely love reading them. This book is the first in a series but can be read as a standalone. Asher is a dominant cop but this story just touches on BDSM themes, nothing too heavy here. Asher meets a younger man while in Las Vegas for a bachelor party. Daniel is the COMPLETE opposite of Asher! He's a free spirit, but he too is very attracted to Asher. 
 Asher's protective tendencies come to the forefront with Daniel but the problem is Daniel is looking for a relationship, and Asher, not so much. I loved seeing how the relationship between these two changed and grew. AS with all Cardeno C. books, the characters are EVERYTHING and Daniel and Asher do not disappoint. Just look at this gorgeous cover for a hint of the steam level of this story, it is a perfect mix of total hotness and sentimental sweetness. Some readers complained about the stalker-ish tendencies of Asher but I didn't get that at all. He is just a big bear of a man trying to find his way to true love (awwwwww!!). 
 Something in the Way He Needs is another perfectly sexy romance from Cardeno C. with just the right touch of emotion and steam! I loved it. If you are looking for an author to read with wonderfully satisfying characters and storylines, then grab this book! You'll love it, too.

 I don't know how Penelope Ward does it, but she takes someone who is so filled with hate and venom and turns him into the biggest hearthrob on the planet. Amelia and Justin haven't had any contact with each other in years - literally - so she feels compelled to sneak a peek at the man she is going to be owning a house with. 
 ""He's...gorgeous. Absolutely freaking gorgeous."" 
 Covering my face, I said, ""Jesus. Please don't tell me that."" 
 ""Take a look."" 
 ""I can't."" 
 Before I could refuse again, Tracy shoved the phone in front of my face. It shook in my hands as I took it. 
 Sweet Jesus. 
 Why did I even look? 
 Lo and behold, Justin shows up to share the summer home with his girlfriend. Cheating is not a deal-breaker for me but not to worry, it doesn't happen here. Justin is in love with his girlfriend and in hate with Amelia. And he makes her life absolutely miserable. 
 ""Even though I was too stunned to say anything, my heart was screaming. I knew deep down my reaction wasn't just because of my physical attraction to him. It was because despite all of the changes, one thing had stayed exactly the same. His eyes. They reflected the same hurt that I remembered from the very last time I saw him."" 
 Justin and Amelia have THE most delicious love-hate relationship throughout much of the story until the real reason for his deep-seated hostility comes out. It is heartbreaking, emotional and very sad, but he and Amelia make an uneasy truce to continue to share the home that her grandmother left to both of them equally when she passed away. 
 ""Will you at least look at me when you're talking to me?"" He turned around and walked toward me slowly then leaned his face in. I could feel his words on my lips when he asked, ""Is this better? You'd rather me in your face like this?"" 
 I could practically taste his breath. My entire body felt weak from the close contact, so I backed away. 
 ""I didn't think so,"" he snarled. 
 There is SO much to this story that can't be given away for fear of major spoilers! But once again, Ms. Ward has crafted a richly-woven, very intense story, with beautifully damaged characters who might not ever find their way back together again. 
 Did I mention the heat factor is off the charts? Sexy, senstive musician anyone? 
 ""Hurt me?"" He let out a slight angry laugh then shocked me with what he said next. ""It changed me. I loved you, Amelia. I was in love with you."" Justin ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. ""How the fuck did you not know that?"" 
 Ah, these two. Living together under one roof becomes almost unbearable. The this book takes a major turn in the second half of the book which only makes Justin and Amelia's story all the more bittersweet. And the Epilogue!! GAHHH!!! Loved. RoomHate is one of my favorite Penelope Ward books and I already miss these characters!!

 As much I loved CRAZY GOOD, the debut book from this author, I am not quite sure what to make of this latest book. CRAZY GOOD was a sexy, refreshing, very readable story with an unforgettable Alpha and it was exciting to read a new author. Unfortunately, TIME AND SPACE did not work for me at all. There is a dramatic, totally unbelievable plot twist literally dropped into the story with zero explanation or set-up.

 This series holds a very special place in my heart because KNIGHT was my very first Kristen Ashley book ever. I didn't quite fully understand the warning that came along with that book, because to me, KNIGHT was absolute perfection. After I then read almost every single book Ms. Ashley wrote, I realized that the Unfinished Heroes Series was a bit different from her other, mostly-nice, all swoony Alpha heroes. And I adore every single one of her ""unfinished"" heroes. 
 SEBRING was like unwrapping a special gift. Olivia was a complex heroine, damaged and scarred both indies and out, having grown up into a crime family. She trusts no one, and for good reason. Her own family is treacherous, immoral and very dangerous. But yet she cannot escape the life that has been mapped out for her. She is an obedient daughter, following the rules until the night she meets Nick Sebring. Olivia is closed off to the world and has given up all hopes for a normal life. 
 ""I'd learned that I didn't allow myself to show emotion. 
 Ever"" 
 I was always fascinated by Nick since he first appeared in KNIGHT. He has a fascinating back story here, investigating Olivia's family and targeting her in an effort to infiltrate the Shade family to take down her father. Nick's first love was caught up in their violent world and became victim of the Shade family's notorious brand of violence. 
 SEBRING is not a pretty, hearts and flowers, sweet love story. Its is gritty, raw, violent, yet amongst all of that, Kristen Ashley's trademark goodness and beauty and love shines through. Nick Sebring himself does not think he can be redeemed but something about Olivia sings to him. They make the perfect couple, really. They both love a certain brand of kink and tom me, are PERFECTLY matched. 
 There is plenty of heartbreak in this book. Olivia carries around secrets in her heart that would absolutely break another person. So it makes her coming together with Nick Sebring even more bittersweet and gorgeous. And Nick...well, I fell in love with him. Yes, the very same Nick Sebring from KNIGHT who caused so much trouble! SEBRING is everything I love about a Kristen Ashley book: family, incredibly hot sex scenes, fast-paced action, forgiveness and yes, love. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Happy reading!

 I love picking up a book, not having any expectations whatsoever, and then being totally swept away and entranced by the story!! That is what happened with THE BALLER. What I though would be a standard, predictable sports romance turned into a page-turner for me, with a sudden and very unexpected twist in the middle of the story! 
 Delilah is a successful sports journalist (another I love about Vi Keeeland's books - her heroines are all smart, feisty women) who is assigned to interview superstar football player Brody Easton. She has had a bit of a dry spell lately which might just be coming to an end with the entry of Brody into her life. 
 ""That man isn't into me. He wants in to me."" 
 ""Same thing."" 
 ""No. There's a major difference."" 
 Brody lays his cards out on the table pretty much from the beginning. From playing a locker room prank on Delilah, to pursuing her relentlessly, I absolutely loved watching their relationship develop. 
 But Brody has a major secret he is hiding. Will it destroy Delilah's trust, once she finally lets herself open up to Brody? 
 I read this book in almost one sitting, it was that enjoyable. I adore Brody, he is cocky yet funny, sexy yet very, very smart and intuitive and very much in tune with what women want. The story takes a surprising turn which I did NOT see coming and I literally could not tell where the author was going to take this story. The ending was very satisfying and I highly recommend THE BALLER!! You will love it.

 ""Love is friendship set on fire. I get it now."" 
 AHHHHHH!!!! Smoking hot, sweet, SEXXXXY and emotional!! This book has it all!! Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy write some of the best new adult romance today and they hit it out of park again (or made a goal??) with US. I fell in love all over again with Jamie Canning and Ryan Wesley. If you are looking to try a MM story, I highly recommend this series. It is pure romance! 
 Wes and Jamie are faced with the real-life pressures of a modern couple when Wes travels with his pro team and Jamie begins a job coaching. Added to the stress of their relationship is that fact that Wes is still hiding his relationship with Jamie. It pained me to suffer alongside both Wes and Jamie when they could not go public with their relationship. A sudden, devastating illness makes everything very clear to Wes and finally gives these two some of the normalcy that other couples enjoy. Leave it to these two authors to write an engaging, hot, funny and very sentimental story that shows the reader that love is for everyone. 
 I also adored Blake, who was funny and a true friend. Hello, he deserves his own book!! US is a wonderfully romantic and incredibly sexy story about two people in love. This book will have you cheering, laughing, clutching your heart and fanning yourself. What more can you ask for? Kudos to Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy for another beautiful story in this series.

 William and Raven are reunited in this story but William is battling forces who are trying to sabotage him. He has finally found the love of his life and he wants nothing more than to worship Raven forever. 
 ""I will never have your nobility of spirit, or your protective nature, but as long as I have your love, I can be content."" 
 William will stop at nothing to protect Raven from both other vampires and from those who scheme to drive them apart. There is lots of action and mystery, written in the style that is completely unique to Sylvain Reynard. This is a very sensual and passionate book, and even if you do not usually read paranormal romance, you will love this story. The streets of Florence seem to come alive! 
 We also learn about William's early life and the tragic story of how he lost his first love. Raven is completely trusting of him and along with the intrigue, there is also a little humor here, too. 
 ""You're giving me a toothache."" 
 He pulled back. ""How is that possible?"" 
 She laughed. ""It's a figure of speech. It means you're being too sweet. Say something awful."" 
 William's expression changed and he brought his lips to her ear. ""I want to take you back to the house, so I can spread you on my bed and do all kinds of wicked things to you."" 
 I can't wait to see what happens next! The Shadow is a beautifully written book and my favorite in the Florentine Series so far. Lush, lyrical, passionate and very intense. The outtakes are absolutely fantastic. Don't miss it!!

 I am a hug fan of Aleatha Romig. Her Consequences series is an absolute favorite of mine and is one of those series that you can't stop talking about non-stop with anyone who'll listen to your ranting and raving about Tony Rawlings. 
 I couldn't wait to read BETRAYAL, the first in a series of 5 full-length novels in the Infidelity series. Now, while cheating does not bother me in the least, for those of you who might shy away from such books, rest assured that's NOT what this book is about. At all. Alexandria has grown up very wealthy, and has tried to break free from her extremely dysfunctional family by attending college as far away as possible from her controlling family and wicked stepfather. 
 After gradating from college, she yearns to ""cut loose"" and does just that during one week at a resort with her best friend. She meets a mysterious, sexy, uber-Alpha named Nox and they embark on a passionate and intense, no-strings-attached week. She uses the name Charli so that she can remain completely anonymous. But they will have just one week together, even though she clearly develops intense feelings for the stunning Nox. 
 ""Our first time will be what you want, what you fantasize about. I'm going to take you, right here, right now."" 
 WOW!! Their scenes together are richly written and breathtaking and they have tons of chemistry. I absolutely loved the alternating timeframes which added to overall feeling of tension and foreboding. There is a completely surprising twist at the end, and if you have a few hours, then prepare to become completely captivated by the sexy Nox and smart, beautiful Alex. Her family drama back home in Savannah, Georgia was a little over-the-top for me but does serve to show how far she has come to break away from her controlling family. 
 This book really brings the story together at the end and it definitely ends on a cliffhanger! I can't wait to see what happens next for Alex and Nox!!",Fri Oct 16 15:09:45 -0700 2015,Sat Oct 17 10:10:34 -0700 2015,Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 -0700 2015,Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 -0700 2015,8,0

 Crashed Out is exactly why I LOVE Tessa Bailey's books! It's lusty, funny and filled with lots of real emotion and heart. And an older woman/younger man theme? YES, PLEASE!! 
 I SWOONED over Sarge. He left town years before as a shy, introverted teenager and has now returned to town a rock star. He has come back to visit his sister and her child and take a break from the pressures of band life. But even though he is now famous, he has never forgotten his older sister's best friend, Jasmine. He has been in love with her since he was young, but she never paid much attention to him. But now...well, let's just say things have changed a LOT since Jasmine last laid eyes on Sarge!! 
 ""But television-size and life-size were two very different things, apparently, because Sarge had been remodeled from a one-story colonial into a big brick mansion."" 
 Jasmine resists Sarge's attention but he pursues her relentlessly (thank God). He is sexy...intense...sensitive...just totally irresistible. Much of the fun of reading a Tessa Bailey book is the trademark dirty talk and boy, does she deliver here. My word. Sarge is EVERYTHING!! And he writes music!! As for Jasmine, I absolutely adored the fact that she was quite a few years older than Sarge and was filled with insecurities. Why would Sarge be interested in her? After all, he could have anyone he wanted. But he has never forgotten the girl he left behind, and he is bound and determined to make her forget their age difference: 
 ""No more fixing me sandwiches. No more ruffling my goddamn hair."" He reached down and grasped her hand, bringing it to the back of his head, moving it in a messy circle. ""If I ever feel your fingers in my hair again, they'd better be pulling my face closer to whatever I'm licking."" 
 I also loved how Sarge encouraged Jasmine to pursue her dreams, and as with all of Ms. Bailey's stories, family plays an important role here. Crashed Out has turned out to be one of my favorite books by Tessa Bailey. I cannot wait for more stories in this series. I highly recommend Crashed Out if you love an uber-sexy, steamy story with plenty of heart!!

 I loved this book!! I am obsessed with Zaal Kostava. This is a really dark but VERY sexy and enjoyable story. Reap is filled with passion, emotion and heat. It is most definitely my favorite Tillie Cole book. The horribly scarred and damaged Zaal absolutely broke my heart. But his beauty and soul shine through when he finds kindness and yes, even love, after many tortuous twists and turns. Although this should read after Raze, it is a stunning story and I highly recommend both books. Talia is a fantastic heroine, strong, beautiful and compassionate. Loving Zaal might come with dire consequences, but she cannot be without him. 
 ""You are my Zaal, the man whose soul has stolen mine."" 
 There are terribly violent and dark themes in this book but I loved it and could not put it down!

 WOW!! Spellbinding, engrossing and sensual, Madame X is a richly detailed story that is filled with mystery and suspense. Very adult and incredibly sexy, this story completely took me by surprise and I can't recommend it highly enough! 
 The blurb to this book is really just a small part of this story, and it is interesting that none of the main characters are mentioned by name in the synopsis. I had not read any reviews on this one going in so I am going to keep this short. If you are looking for a very adult, very sensual read, then Madame X is for you. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the book and I absolutely fell in love with the male protagonists (yes, plural) and cannot WAIT for the next book! 
 ""Your sexuality belongs to me, X. No one else may even so much as fucking smell you, do you understand me? You. Are. Mine."" 
 There is a touch of BDSM in this book but I believe that more will be revealed on that front in the next story. There are themes of dominance and control here but I was thrown off guard several times by the direction that this story took. 
 We are introduced to both Caleb and Logan in this story and while one might seem cruel, controlling and calculating, I do not believe that all is at seems and that Logan, who we meet later in the story, will also have many, many layers to him. I don't think there are any real villains or heroes in this book (I think?! I could be very wrong!) and that is the genius of this story. 
 Sexy, explicit, fast-paced and very, very creative, Madame X thrilled me on many levels. I couldn't put it down!

 WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD! 
 This book picks up from the end of Book 1, and explores Weston pursuing Mirella. Please note that this is the second book in a trilogy and most definitely ends with an incredible cliffhanger! I found this book to be incredibly gripping, dealing with a taboo subject in an erotic, almost romantic way. 
 Ms. Roya's writing is charming and playful at times and almost addictive. I was absolutely fascinated by Weston and Gabe and was kept on the edge of my seat waiting for their marriages and their relationships to crash and burn. 
 ""We didn't learn from our mistakes. We just made them all over again."" 
 I found myself thinking about these characters even when I wasn't reading, which to me, is the sign of a good book. Mirella and Weston go back to their arrangement but Mirella lays down the new rule: their relationship is to be only physical, with no emotional attachment. Weston falling in love with her is what got them into trouble the first time around. 
 ""I shouldn't have let this all this get so out of control."" 
 This book is still told only from Mirella's POV but it delves more into describing Gabe and Weston's feelings. Bridget, however, is still very much a mystery. I would love to know more about her. In Book 2, the two couples try to have a ""normal"" relationship, which does require a suspended sense of reality, but I loved the way Ms. Roya explored the boundaries of their relationships. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop here, either by Gabe ending the open marriage arrangement or by Weston falling in love with Mirella all over again. I was not disappointed! This is an incredibly addictive story, and I can't wait for the next book in this trilogy. I am dying to read more about Gabe and Weston, two very passionate, sexy characters who each deserve their own book!

 MAJOR heartache. MAJOR passion. And a strong heroine with a painful past! I'm obsessed with Scarlett and Dante!! 
 ""Love is War"" is a great description of this second chance, lovers-to-enemies story. BREAKING HIM was nothing that I expected. I need the second book yesterday! I must know more about Scarlett and Dante!! 
 This story has very much of a Tristan-and-Danika feel to it. The chemistry between Scarlett and Dante is almost so real, you can feel it leap off the pages. Why is Scarlett so ANGRY about everything? At first, her prickly attitude kept me at a distance, but once I learned more about her character and her background, I absolutely fell in love with her and was rooting for her. And Dante, well he seems like the perfect guy at first and I just know that he will end up doing the right thing. He and Scarlett MUST be together! They are meant for each other!! Do you hear me, Author Lady?! 
 The secondary characters are all fantastic, and are an integral part of the story. Ms. Lilley does a great job of describing the social hierarchy of small town life and how stifling it can be for those who do not ""fit in"". I literally read this book in one sitting and cannot wait for the continuation of Scarlett and Dante's story. Ms. Lilley has once again created an absolutely unforgettable couple whose passion and chemistry burned through every page.

 Karina Halle never ceases to amaze with her writing! She can take a reader from swoony, sexy contemporary romance, to stories like Dirty Promises, a brutal, rough, gritty and violent story that is incredibly gripping, sexy and readable. 
 Javier Bernal is a cruel man. Yet I still felt sympathy for him (it's true!) because if you have taken the journey with this character, you will know he is the product of his history and background. But make no mistake, this book is violent and is set in the world of drug cartels. If you are looking for a different read, with fantastic writing, then I highly recommend this series. 
 Javier and Luisa have a marriage that is on the brink of falling apart. Their story here is an incredibly wild ride and is most definitely NOT for the faint of heart. But if you are willing to take a risk with your reading, then you will be immensely rewarded. I did not know what to expect with DIRTY PROMISES because I knew this would be a gritty story, maybe even more so than the other books in this series. Karina Halle really delivers the goods with this book and if you are a fan of dark, action-packed stories with a very damaged ""hero"", then please read this series. The books and the characters are unforgettable!!

 This book is why I read contemporary romance. The swoony hero, the beautiful, sweet heroine who is hiding a tragic secret, the explosive passion, but most of all, the deep and emotional connection I felt for Adam and Evie all added up to a perfect page-turner that kept me up all night. 
 Adam!! My heart broke for him and for the love he lost with Evie. Adam and Evie (LOVE the names!) fell in love when they were just teenagers. Adam did not trust many people so when Evie suddenly disappeared, he became even more bitter than he was before. He spends years searching for her and when he finally finds her, his feelings are a mix of rage and heartbreak over their lost years. Evie refuses to tell him why she disappeared suddenly all those years before, so their reunion is bittersweet, filled with longing and regret, but also undeniable and explosive passion. 
 WHEN I WAS YOURS is told through a series of flashbacks which put me through every single emotion possible. The story, set against the backdrop off Hollywood and the mega-rich, is more than just a classic rich boy meets poor girl love story. It's sexy, heartfelt, and heartbreaking all at once. The unexpected twist had my heart in my throat and had me silently cheering for our MC's to get their happily ever after. 
 ""You cut your hair."" 
 ""It has been ten years."" 
 ""I know. I just...I remember a time when you said you'd never cut your hair."" A small smile touches my lips at the memory. 
 ""Yeah, and I remember when you promised to love me till death do us part. Shit changes."" 
 My smile drops from my face. My cheeks sting like he's just slapped me. 
 I deserved that. Doesn't stop it from hurting like a bitch though. 
 Samantha Towle is one of my favorite writers and she absolutely delivered the goods with this story. The characters and their sweet, sexy and passionate love story won't soon be forgotten.

It is very hard to describe the emotions in simple words. Gut-wrenching? Heart-pounding? All of those happen to me and when a book is the end of a beloved series, well, let's just say that I was a sobbing mess while reading this Epilogue. 
 I binge read The 'Burg Series several years ago while on a long vacation that involved a lot of driving. Needless to say, I volunteered to sit in the back seat while on most of this vacation so I could read this fantastic series! As with all of her books, each of Ms. Ashley's series are slightly different; in the 'Burg, the characters are all a little older, a lot jaded, fiercely protective, and above all, unforgettable. 
 HOLD ON is a spectacular end to the series. Cher appeared earlier in the series, a hard-luck woman who struggles to keep her head above water and lives paycheck-to-paycheck to support herself and her beloved son. She never, ever believes that love will happen for her, and never, ever believes that she will find happiness with a man who will love and cherish her and her son. Cher broke my heart over and over, and I cried many times throughout this book at her sadness and despair. 
 ""But he'd never give me what I wanted. 
 I forgot. 
 I forgot that I wasn't the kind of girl who got what she wanted. 
 Not once. 
 Not in my whole f*g life. 
 Yeah, I'd forgotten that."" 
 Cher has a major case of unrequited love for Garrett (Merry), who in turn cannot forget the ex-wife who broke his heart. Sounds like a real downer of a book, right? But no! HOLD ON is a tale of mended hearts, beautiful possibilities and bright futures that everyone dreams about in their heart of hearts. There is no one who can infuse a story with magnificence and hope like Ms. Ashley. And HOLD ON is the perfect story of love and redemption, of fighting for what you want, and for holding on when you know you have goodness within your grasp. 
 The ending of this book very much reminded me of the series finale of one of my favorite TV shows, Six Feet Under. Kristen Ashley is the Queen of epilogues and I will never, ever forget this one. I am so sad to say goodbye to the families of the 'Burg but I know that Ms. Ashley has even more goodness in store for her readers. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.

 The Allure of Dean Harper follows the story of Dean and Lily, the best friends of Julian and Jo from The Allure of Julian Lefray. Lily has just arrived in New York City and is opinionated, talented and very, very funny. She and Dean do not meet under the best of circumstances. Dean, a control freak and workaholic, arrives back from a business trip and his first meeting with his new bartender does not go well. The extremely talented Lily has been hired as a temporary bartender, and although she is incredible at her job, she immediately clashes with Dean and is actually fired right then and there. 
 From there, this funny enemies-to-lovers takes off into a fast-paced, behind-the-scenes peek into the competitive world of the restaurant business. Lily and Dean clearly are attracted to each other but they both bring out the worst in each other. Lily is outspoken and knowledgeable and I loved that she wouldn't back down from her opinions. Dean is driven, stubborn and very difficult. Their banter is witty and this story is the kind of book that R.S. Grey writes best. The scenes where Lily tries to adapt to life in the city are priceless. 
 This is a fast-paced, laugh-out-loud, classic enemies-to-lovers story. If you are looking for a modern, funny and light read, with a HEA, then you will love The Allure of Dean Harper!

 Although this is the third book in a series, it is a complete standalone. The author does an amazing job of giving just the right amount of background on the Blindfold Club and on the characters in this book. The story is fantastic and the sex scenes...well, they are absolutely scorching. There is a threesome (almost a foursome, kind of a two + two-some) that rivals anything I've ever read. And I do love a good menage scene or three! 
 Em is the classic ""good girl"": she's smart, follows the rules but is wealthy in her own right. Joseph is the owner of the ""Blindfold Club"", an elite place where the woman have sex with their clients while blindfolded. High-end prostitutes but Em doesn't know this side of Joseph's business. She just thinks he is a wealthy club owner who has a very, very kinky side, and she wants to be very, very bad. 
 ""Being wrong and bad was just as I'd hoped it would be. It was so, so good."" 
 Joseph is a Dom and is several years older than Em. He is insanely attracted to her innocence and youth and they begin an affair where he will teach her how to be a submissive. Em is completely different from the other women Joseph has been with and he quickly becomes addicted to her, despite there being a million reasons why they shouldn't be together. 
 Now this might seem like a tired old trope, wealthy, older, worldly guy pursues a young, inexperienced girl, but this book is SO much more!! I was addicted from the the first page. This book has humor, witty dialogue, a great story and THE most amazing, prolonged sex scenes EVER. 
 Of course things grow complicated and there are many secrets between these two. Em might be a threat to Joseph's business, so will he be willing to give that up? They both push each other's boundaries and the conclusion was perfect. This book is a very explicit, very adult story that kept me riveted from beginning to end. It is a page-turner all the way! I loved it and can't wait to read the other books in this series!

 Two words: Knox Masters! I really enjoyed this book, Jen Frederick is one of my favorite New Adult writers. Sexy and very engaging, Sacked is a fast-paced, refreshingly funny story. 
 Jen Frederick's writing is like a breath of fresh air. This story is refreshing and verrra sexy while also sweet and funny at the same time. I LOVED it! Knox Masters is a college football superstar and Ellie is a transfer student who just might be his perfect match. She's smart, athletic, understands the game of football...but wait, she's hiding a secret that could jeopardize both their futures. And well, Knox is a virgin so there's that, too. 
 I often find that New Adult books don't hold enough romance or sexy times for me but SACKED has all of that PLUS MORE. It's a steamy, well-written story and it provides very knowing glimpses into the world of American college football. Plus I absolutely LOVED the witty back-and-forth between Knox and Ellie! And the fact that Knox is a virgin, well, I am usually a Doubting Thomas but this storyline just works. When he and Ellie finally get together, the slow-burn build up is totally worth it and the scenes between these two are off the charts hot!! 
 SACKED is a sexy, light, fast-paced read, and it is not just for fans of sports romance. There's plenty of humor and a little bit of drama and it all adds up to a terrific read. Knox Masters could not possibly be any hotter and I'm really looking forward to more books about the supporting characters. I loved SACKED and highly recommend it!!

 SIGH! A smart, modern, contemporary romance that was pure pleasure from beginning to end! Avery is newly arrived in Rome, reeling from a disastrous marriage where she's actually felt stifled and trapped for some time. Avery reconnects in Rome with an old friend AND with an old flame. Her boyfriend from a summer abroad in Europe is also in Rome. Marcelo has never forgotten Avery, and and has always wondered why she left Europe that summer so suddenly so many years before. 
 Avery has always played by others' rules: she married because it was the right thing to do, led a certain life because it was emptied of her, but here in Rome, with her friend Daisy, she is really free for the first time in her life to be her own woman. And Marcello still finds her beautiful and sexy and talented and they begin a gorgeous romance set against the stunning beauty of Italy. 
 ""For the first time in a very long time, I felt treasured."" 
 Fans of second-chance romance will devour this love story and revel in the stunning European settings! And who could resist falling in love against the incredibly exciting backdrop of Rome? This book is pure magic. There is just the right amount of drama and I adored the intelligent and supportive secondary characters. Kudos to Nina Bocci for a fabulous debut book! And remember, it is never too late to start something new or make a chance in your life. Just go for it!

 Well, I certainly love going into a book not knowing what to exepct. And Grayson's Vow took me by surprise. This is not a ""typical"" Mia Sheridan story but it is magical, enchanting and irresistible nonetheless. Two very strong, sexy and damaged lead characters make this a very memorable story. 
 The story begins in a very gripping way: Kira is desperate, almost homeless, and immediately propositions Grayson Hawthorn with an almost-insane scheme: she must marry in order to gain access to an inheritance from her grandmother. Grayson, too, his desperate: he is about to lose his precious winery, and has reached a dead end due to his prison record. 
 Grayson is sexy, handsome, yet aloof and emotionally closed off. He has been hurt by those he trusted and loved. Kira is also emotionally damaged, but yet she still remains warm and engaging and filled with hope. She is young and impulsive but truly believes marrying Grayson is her only hope. 
 I fell in love with Grayson. He is cruel to most people but when you learn about his past, well, your heart will break for him. And Kira was betrayed by those she trusted most, which could have left her cruel and emotionally cut-off but she still retains the capacity to love. 
 ""In Vino Veritas. In wine there is truth. In love there is truth."" 
 Grayson's Vow is set in and around Napa, California, one of my most favorite places in the world!! I absolutely loved the scenery and the setting. There is also an engaging cast of supporting characters in this book which I loved. There is an air of magic to this book, which adds a bit of whimsy and lightens the emotional heaviness of the plot. There is PLENTY of steam and Grayson is just YUMMY. Who doesn't love a bad boy with a heart of gold? 
 This book is very different from Ms. Sheridan's other books, and gets into some overly-dramatic scenes near the end of the story. I still found this to be a beautiful story about the power of love and acceptance and honesty. And the EPILOGUE...OMG!! A 10+ which had be sobbing happy tears for Grayson and Kira.

I can live with instalove and instalust, but the main characters got together way too early in the story for me to feel any connection between them whatsoever. The storyline is clever and could have made a good book, but there was just too much thrown in to create any real depth to the characters or to the situations. There is a major plot twist at the end that is just completely and utterly unbelievable. I give the author credit for some interesting ideas, but this book is in need of a good editor. Also there is a wrong word that is used during a crucial scene that hopefully was fixed in the final version. I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume that is was because if not, it completely changed the tone of the scene. ( Usually I purchase the finished book but I didn't in this case.)

 God this book tore me up!!! Gutted me. Enthralled me. Made me feel anxious, sad, elated...all at once. Thank you, Tarryn Fisher, for this magnificent roller-coaster ride of a book. I won't ever forget it. 
 At once magical and painfully realistic, F*CK LOVE is like nothing you've read before. It has some similarities to one of all-time favorite series, The Love Me With Lies books, but it is different, unique and wonderfully, beautifully hopeful and cynical at the same time. Can that be? Tarry Fisher pulls it off with one of the most surprising books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. 
 The story begins with a completely disorienting scene that sets the tone for the rest of the book. 
 Kit hit me out of nowhere. I had a dream that made me take a closer look at a guy I was otherwise ignoring. And from that dream I discovered a connection. I don't even think about the dream anymore. For the last eight weeks I've been living it. 
 Yes, the main character Helena has a dream, in which she is living a life completely different from her current path. What will she do with it? Will her dream become her reality? In true Tarryn Fisher form, the author has created a kind, beautiful, smart and very quirky girl, who aches for what she cannot have. 
 ""We have something, Helena. In another life, it would have been a beautiful something."" That hurts. God, does it. I've seen that life. He doesn't even know what he's talking about. In his mind, I'm just some possibility that could have been, but in my mind, he's the only possibility. 
 F*ck Love is a wildly unpredictable book that is poignant and uplifting, funny and tragic, and will take you on a roller-coaster ride of emotions. I can't help but wonder how much of this story (if any) is based on real-life events. And yes, I imagine Tarryn Fisher herself as Helena. To me, it is a perfect fit! Don't miss F*ck Love, it is absolutely one of my favorite books of 2016.

I know she is a favorite of many readers, so I was thrilled to have the chance to read this book. I adored this story! It is a witty, fast-paced and yes, very emotional story about coming to terms with your life and facing your own mortality. 
 The author has created two very lively and memorable characters in Corin and Beckett. Corin is obsessed with her physical health, convinced that she has a multitude of undiagnosed ailments. She does suffer from panic attacks, but she is sure she is going to die at any minute from a heart attack. 
 She finds her way to a support group for heart patients where she meets Beckett, who has actually suffered a nbear-fatal heart attack and has had his regular day-to-day activities sharply curtailed. He is in the prime of his life but because of his brush with death, now sees everything differently. 
 Corin is morbid and morose while Beckett is warm and funny and outgoing. She looks back on her life while he looks forward: 
 ""Stop thinking about your life in increments. Seconds. Minutes. Days. Look at the bigger picture and embrace whatever time you have. Don't look constantly toward the end. Enjoy the right now."" 
 This story is very funny and balances the serious subjects perfectly with witty banter and sexy times between the two main characters. I really enjoyed this story and recommend it for all fans of New Adult romance. While the conclusion is a bit predictable, the wit, sarcasm and solid writing make Butterfly Dreams a very enjoyable read.

 Classic enemies-to-lovers romance, one that I couldn't put down once I started reading! Hollywood-superstar-meets-ordinary-girl is one of my favorite themes, and Alessandra Torre serves it up with plenty of sexiness, warmth and down-home Southern style. This is a book that could have gotten bogged down in cliches but in the hands of Alessandra Torre, it is a smart, funny, and very insightful peek into the donwside of Hollywood superstardom. I absolutely loved the realistic yet loving portrait of small-town Southern life as painted by Ms. Torre. Although the author is quick to state that this is a contemporary romance and is not like her other books, there is PLENTY of steam and sexy times in this book!! Cole is just irresistibile. And the banter between the hero and heroine is priceless. And no one writes a smart and sassy heroine quite like Alessandra Torre. The only quarrel I had with this story is the portrayal of the legal proceedings involving Brad DeLuca. Meh. Other than that, I loved Hollywood Dirt and found myself with a book hangover after leaving the fictional town of Quincy GA.

 Totally unexpected story by the incredible Leylah Attar! Dark and emotional but ultimately passionate and hopeful. A must-read. I couldn't put it down and read it almost in one sitting. 
 After I read 53 LETTERS FOR MY LOVER, I fell in love with Leylah Attar's writing. It is rich, mature, and lush. I couldn't wait until her newest book and was completely intrigued by the synopsis for THE PAPER SWAN. Not much of the plot is given away, for good reason. There is not much I can add to the stellar reviews for this book, other than to say that Ms. Attar has a unique voice and an incredible gift with words. Nothing prepared me for the emotions that I felt while reading The Paper Swan. The characters, the plot, the epilogue - all perfect, unique and gloriously realized. 
 I like a good dark read as much as I love a sexy contemporary romance and this book actually blends these two genres together. My attention has been wandering as of late and I have struggled to finish a lot of the books I have been reading. However, I read The Paper Swan from cover to cover (do Kindles even have ""covers""?) and basically ignored real life until I finished this magnificent story. I don't know how to describe this story other than to say everyone has some redeeming quality, no matter how evil they act, and those whom you think are above criticism might have skeletons in their closet and may not be what they seem. 
 The story is filled with tons of suprising twists, along with a stunning story of survival, redemption and forgiveness Nothing can prepare you for this story or for the depth of emotion you will feel. The dialogue is witty and intelligent and the heroine is smart and loving and very capable. 
 Without giving too much away, this is a story about love, passion, family, hate, revenge and survival. And devotion. 
 ""We are stars with flaws that still sparkle and shine. We always strive, always want, always have more questions than answers, but there are moments like these, full of magic and contentment, when souls get a glimpse of the divine and quite simply, lose their breath."" 
 The Paper Swan is one of the most unique books I've ever read. Based on the synopsis, I went into thinking I was getting one thing, but was surprised with what this book was actually about. There is much more I want to say about this book, but it's hard to without giving anything away. This is just one of those books that it's better to go into blind. The fact that you don't know what to expect makes The Paper Swan even better. 
 I will say that The Paper Swan is an incredibly written book with tons of plot twists and smart characters, The story spans a good amount of time and that adds a richness to the relationship between the two main protagonists. 
 This book is captivating, intense, sexy and funny all in one book. I am still thinking about The Paper Swan weeks after I finished. Simply put, The Paper Swan was absolutely amazing. I can't recommend it highly enough. 5 fantastic stars!!!

 ""I can't decide how to f* you, he says. ""I want to take you in every position. I want to f* you like an animal and a saint. I want to keep you on the brink for an hour and take four orgasms from you. I can't do it all tonight. I'm kind of pissed about that."" 
 Hardball is sexy, heartfelt, exciting, funny, steamy and addictive. I LOVED Dash Wallace! He is seemingly perfect, gorgeous, a gifted athlete, but he is actually filled with compulsions and must adhere to a strict routine at all times. His baseball career and his sanity depend on it. I fell totally in love with this damaged man. 
 The Synopsis to this book doesn't really show the depth of emotion in this book. There is so much more than just the sizzling romance between Dash and Vivian. There is the amazingly detailed descriptions of the game of baseball. There are the wonderful supporting characters, including Vivian's elderly father. There is the constant battle within Dash's head over his ADHD and the obsessive way he deals with routine and his superstitions. 
 Vivian has only had one boyfriend in her life so Dash hits her like a freight train. OMG, their scenes together are on FIRE!!! CD Reiss writes some of the best erotic romance around. And set against the backdrop of Los Angeles and baseball, well, Hardball is just perfection. 
 I LOVED the imperfection of these characters. Vivian and Dash are both insecure in their own way. Vivian doesn't think she's good enough or sexy enough for a glamorous baseball player like Dash. He is battling with his own internal demons. These characters captured my heart. And kudos to CD Reiss for the fabulously detailed descriptions of the game of baseball. 
 I am a huge fan of CD Reiss but even if you've never read one of her books, give Hardball a try. It is glorious.

 Ethan Dexter is SMOKING HOT and sweet as sugar - my favorite combination!! 
 ""Just say the word and you can have me, Fiona."" 
 AS you can read from the synopsis, Ethan ""Dex"" Dexter is a pro football player who also happens to be a virgin. The author did an fabulous job with this part of the story (it is a romance, after all) and I totally believed the sweet-hot feelings that Dex and Fiona had for each other. First and foremost, this is a love story with fantastic steamy sex scenes and perfectly witty and funny banter between the characters. 
 Dex and Fi met years earlier and he has never forgotten her. She is a smart and feisty woman who is not so sure she wants to jump into a relationship with a professional football player who also happens to live in an other city. I loved how Dex practically wore his heart on his sleeve, which to me, made him all the more irresisitbile. Ms. Callihan writes loving, sexy men, and Dex is no exception. And the beard, tattoos and, ahem, piercings only added to his allure. 
 ""I want you badly enough to put all my cards on the table, show who I really am. So I guess it's your play now."" 
 I read this book almost non-stop and adored each and every character! Dex and Fi went through some difficult times and not all was sunshine and roses for them. The Game Plan is perfect for when you want a very sexy but light and fast-paced sports romance that will make you laugh out loud and TOTALLY swoon over the story's hero. I also loved how the author portrayed the trials and tribulations of living life in the public eye, and how Dex and Fi dealt with the very public intrusion into their private lives. 
 Kristen Callihan has quickly become one of my favorite writers. Enjoy sexy Dex!!

 ""Freedom is so close I can taste its bitterness on the tip of my tongue.: 
 What a stunning story!! I adored this tortured tale of Low and Poesy, two star-crossed lovers who spend much of the book on the run from the authorities after a string of bank robberies. It is a tribute to the talent of Mary Elizabeth that you actually feel tremendous sympathy for Low, the poor boy from the wrong side of the tracks whose life seems doomed from the first page. 
 Low has the misfortune to have a criminal for a father and to be dirt-poor. A petty crime lands him in prison with hardened criminals who teach him how to rob banks. When he is released, he tries desperately to live on the right side of the law. But poverty, hunger and sheer desperation drive him to a string of crimes, with the loyal Poesy right by his side. She is absolutely devoted to him. 
 ""I'm here,"" she chose in a for-sure tone. ""We did this together, and anything we do together is right, Low."" 
 I spent most of this book on the edge of my seat, in a constant state of anxiety for the handsome, sad Low and his beautiful Poesy. He is desperate to live a simple, normal life. Low is not at all greedy, but he just wants to be able to eat, help Poesy with school and help his own family. They seem doomed from the start but they overcome so many obstacles that I was cheering for them throughout the book. 
 LOW is a fast-paced, very gritty story that is incredibly addictive. This was my first book by Mary Elizabeth and I am in love with her writing style!! I loved LOW and I hope for more about these two unforgettable characters.

 Freedom.

 But then, I lost it. 
 This is Pepper Winters are her VERY darkest, very close in tone to the fantastic Monsters in the Dark Series but even darker!! Be warned that the first half of this book is quite grim, and follows the imprisonment of young Tasmin (now called Pim) at the hands of a sadistic monster. There is scene after scene of graphic physical abuse (along with sexual abuse.) The Indebted Series (one of my favorite series ever) might not even be as dark as Pennies. As much as I absolutely adore Q and Jethro, I have high hopes for the mysterious and ruthless Elder Prest!! But don't be fooled, he is as black-hearted as they come and explicitly warns Pim that he is no hero. 
 I wasn't a nice man. 
 I was a tormentor. A killer. A thief. 
 And I wanted to steal her courage drop by fucking drop. 
 After all this darkness in Pennies, I just KNOW that Pepper Winters will craft an unforgettable romance between Prest and Pim, as only she can do. After all, a very wise author told me that you ""gotta start dark to enjoy the light."" 
 The writing is excellent as always, very suspenseful and very descriptive and yet never revealing too much about Prest or about the future storyline. The ending left me hopeful and wanting more. I can't wait to finish this dark journey with Prest and Pim!

 Funny, refreshing and very sexy, Cocky Bastard was a pleasant surprise! I loved it! I'm obsessed with Chance. The story very fast-paced and engaging and the dialogue witty and filled with double entendres. 
 ""... If I change your tire, you let me ride with you."" 
 ""Ride with me?"" 
 ""Ride me, yes."" 
 ""What did you just say?"" 
 ""You're hearing things."" 
 I loved how Chance showed Aubrey how to loosen up and live in the moment. And I absolutely loved Aubrey's character, she's smart, and has amazing chemistry with Chance. 
 This story is very sexy but has lots of warmth and heart. I really enjoyed it! And I'll never look at Pixy Stix or bobbleheads the same way again.

 I have devoured all of Ms. Cunning's previous books, I mean, who doesn't love the mega-hot rockers of the Sinners on Tour series? Those were among the first books I read when I started reading romance. And the new Exodus End book doesn't disappoint in the steam department, this book has everything and more in the sexytimes department. 
 Ms. Cunning once again writes an immensely readable and incredibly HAWT story, this time involving the virginal and very sweet Toni who is hired to write an interactive biography of the band. Something about her attracts Logan, the sexy, Mr. Hot Rocker, who actually finds her innocence an incredible turn-on! Their scenes together are, um, breathtaking and will leave you with a new respect for there writing talents of Olivia Cunning. 
 There is a very sweet story involving Toni's family life, she is leaving behind her special needs sister to go on tour with Exodus End. Her mother is the owner of publishing company that Toni works for andI loved the tension between her mother and Toni over the company. There is lots of drama involving a co-worker who does't have Toni's best interests at heart. 
 Our favorite Sinners all make appearances here and it was great meeting up with them again, 
 But the heart of this story is the wonderful sexual awakening of Toni and the hands of Logan, I mean, Olivia Cunning can write a sex scene like no other! Toni is very endearing and not your typical flashy, sexy groupie that Logan would normally go for. Their scenes together also have a lot of heart to them. I adored this first book in the Exodus End series and I can't wait to read about the other band members! I hope there will be more!

 I am a HUGE fan of second-chance romance and Walk Through Fire might be one of my all-time favorites in this genre. Everything I love about Ms. Ashley's writing is here: an older couple, a smart but damaged woman, an Alpha male and lots and lots of ridiculously hot sex. I could go on and on about the gorgeous moments in this book but really, you should just read it and experience the emotions for yourself. I got the same feelings in this book as I did in Soaring, and while it takes a lot for me to cry while reading a book, I cried plenty while reading Millie and Logan's story. 
 You learn right off the bat that Logan was Millie's first true love and that things ended suddenly between them years earlier. Jump forward and Millie runs into Logan and just the sound of his voice stuns her and she feels compelled to explain to him what happened decades before. He has been married and had children but Millie has spent the years alone, although successful in her business and very close to her own family. Logan, who hasn't seemed to have gotten over Millie walking away from him, is still bitter and is very, very cruel to Millie when she tries to explain her behavior to him: 
 ""I'm done not because I'm done but because there's nothing left of me to burn. You have it all! You've always had it all! I gave up everything so you could have it all! Please! God! Leave me to my nothing!"" 
 I don't want to spoil the story but you will probably guess Millie's reasons for suddenly breaking up with Logan pretty early on in the story. As bitter as Logan is towards Millie, you know that eventually these two will have their HEA but their path there is both beautiful and very bittersweet at the same time. 
 There is a mature aspect to this story which drew me in from the first page. These aren't kids or twenty-somethings, these characters are all adults, with their own kids, careers, families, and relationships to deal with. i absolutely loved how Logan's ex-wife was portrayed in this book and how Millie interacted with her. Oh, and did I mention the sex in this book is completely hot?? Because of course, you know that it is!! I don't often re-read books but I have already re-read parts of Walk Through Fire while I wait (not so) patiently for the next book from Ms. Ashley.

 Lauren Dane writes an super-sexy story, with a couple who have some piercings in very, um, key places! 
 Ms. Dane has written some of my favorite and sexiest contemporary romance novels (The Brown Family series is a favorite and highly recommended - they are totally addictive.) Opening Up is the first in her new Ink and Chrome series. The plot is light, steamy, funny, fast-paced and pretty much angst-free. 
 I couldn't wait to dive into this book and I read it one sitting. PJ is a young, strong-willed woman who breaks free from her overbearing family and ventures out on her own in the world off body shop painting. She meets Asa, who is older, totally domineering and sex-on-a-stick. He accepts her for who she is and their sex is, to put it mildly, off the charts. Think multiple piercings, sexy tattoos and passionate car sex! 
 ""You're defiling her in your head right now, aren't you?"" 
 Hell yes. 
 There is nothing too dramatic or earth shattering in this book. I loved the chemistry between PJ and Asa and you will need a fan for their scenes together. OPENING UP is the perfect summertime read to take to the pool or beach, and the secondary characters are just as enjoyable! (I cannot wait for Duke, Asa's friend, to get his story in FALLING UNDER, coming out in August. Hello! Can you say huge, tattooed and sexy?) All in all, OPENING UP is a passionate, funny, dirty and light summer read with a HEA. Enjoy! 
 ""Wait. I want to see you put the condom on over the piercing. I should know this. For future reference.""

I loved all the characters in this book, plus Steph and Lident make appearances as well. However, you do not need to have read The Pact to enjoy this story. Nicola is living on the edge, trying to make a home for her daughter Ava but struggling to make ends meet since Ava's dad is absent. Along comes Bram, who seems to be quite the sexy player, confident and bold. 
 But Bram isn't what he seems, there's more than meets the eye here, and after some amazing chemsitry and hot sex, Nicole finds herself falling for Bram. There is no Insta-love here, Nicola and Bram's banter is great and she does not instantly fall for his moves. 
 I loved Ava, and Ms. Halle writes the scenes with her with great compassion and understanding. Ava is adorable. But sexy-talking Bram is the star here, and I really liked how he had many different sides to his personality. This is a classic contemporary romance, with modern characters, genuine dialogue and very realistic situations. 
 There is a wonderful Epilogue plus a suprising twist which was all very satisfying. The Offer is a great summer read, full of sexy times, great banter and very sympathetic characters.

EVERYTHING about this story worked for me, from the mostly male POV, to the smoking hot sex scenes and the very sympathetic characters. 
 No surprises in the storyline: Father Tyler Bell is tempted by the smart and beautiful Poppy Danforth and they begin a torrid affair that sorely tests his faith and his commitment to the priesthood. I immediately connected with both of these characters and sympathized with Tyler's deep yearning and longing for Poppy: 
 ""I was supposed to be a shepherd of the flock, not the wolf. 
 Not the wolf who had woken up this morning grinding his hips into the mattress because he'd had a very intense dream with Poppy and her carnal sins in a starring role. Guilt wormed through me at the memory."" 
 Poor Father Bell! Everything he worked so hard for was in jeopardy. I absolutely loved his internal dialogue and the backstory that led him to join the priesthood. If anyone was ever NOT cut out to take a vow of celibacy, it was certainly Tyler Bell, but he really loves his parish and congregants. I also thought the black humor worked really well here, as a counterbalance to the fairly serious themes of the book: 
 ""I could do this. There was life after fucking up, after all, even for those who lived without fucking."" 
 Both Tyler and Poppy realize quickly that they not only can they not keep their hands off each other, but they both have very deep feelings for each other. Tyler truly cared about Poppy, and he was risking everything for her. Their scenes together are just...irresistible! 
 ""Was I only telling myself I cared about her spiritual development, so that I could be near her? No, I decided. That for sure wasn't true. It was just that the actual truth was so much worse. I cared about her as a person, as a soul, and I wanted to fuck her, and that was the recipe for something much worse than carnal sin. It was a recipe for falling in love."" 
 PRIEST is an incredibly enjoyable, sexy, and yes, sometimes even funny story. I plan to read the author's other books because I loved this one so much. PRIEST is simply outstanding! 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ""Pursue righteousness, the author of Timothy said. But did righteousness carry a bottle of Macallan 12 in her hand? Because Poppy did."" 
 ""Be good be good be good, I told myself as I approached her. Don't jump her bones. Don't fantasize about fucking her tits. Be a good priest.""

Each of her stories is richly detailed, deeply felt and intensely sexy. Better When It Hurts is no exception. Although I have not read Love the Way You Lie, I was able to jump right in to Blue and Lola's story here. Both are very damaged characters who had to learn how to survive on their own from a young age. 
 These two have a long past together which is why Blue insists on acting as security on the nights she dances at the club where they both work. Lola tries to put on a tough exterior but her toughness is just an act that is in part driven by guilt over what happened between the two of them when they were foster kids. This is a gritty story but as with all Skye Warren books, the sex scenes are totally hot and very, very intense. 
 Lola is not always the most likable character but she is very real and just trying to do what she has to in order to survive. Blue is totally Alpha, sexy, domineering and despite the hard exterior, is a guy with a heart. These two have incredible chemistry. If you like grittier stories with lots of erotic scenes and the right touch of romance, then Better When It Hurts is for you! Another great story from Skye Warren.

 HIM is a totally sexy story mixed with the perfect amount of sweet, passionate romance. Wes and Jamie are absolutely delicious together. Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy have become two of my favorite authors!! 
 I read a fair amount of M/M romance books, so I approached HIM with a wary eye. Would it have enough steam for me? Would the two heroes only dance around their attraction for each other, but never really get down to business? Would the dialogue be witty enough to hold my pathetically short attention span? 
 The answer to all these questions is a resounding YES!! 
 Because I adored Elle Kennedy's Off Campus series and loved Sarina Bowen's The Shameless Hour, I was thrilled to be able to read their collaboration together. And once I started reading HIM, I literally could NOT put this book down! Jamie Canning and Ryan 'Wes' Wesley were perfectly real characters to me and the writing style so seamless, that I could not tell which author wrote which chapter, scene or verse. Even if you're new to the M/M genre, I highly recommend this book for the witty banter, sexy times and catchy plot. Two hot hockey players? Yes please!! 
 Jamie and Wes were childhood friends who lost touch after a youthful incident that caused an unfortunate miscommunication. Lo and behold, they run into each other years later and both realize that they have been the ""missing link"" in each other's lives. But does Jamie just want to be friends with Wes? Set among the world of college hockey, HIM delivers the perfect amount of hot, dirty, sweet emotion as both Wes and Jamie learn to come to terms with their true feelings. Wes has always loved Jamie and finds it difficult to keep their relationship platonic. 
 ""As I watch Jamie Canning stop another dizzying slap shot. As I admire the grace and deadly precision with which he moves. 
 My weakness is him."" 
 I absolutely LOVED how the authors wrote a seamless story that perfectly illustrated the difficulties that gay sports players must face. Wes and Jamie were perfectly suited for each other, even if Jamie at first was reluctant to admit his true feelings for Wes. And Wes, on the other hand, is a total commitment-phone, never allowing anyone to get too close, and hopping from meaningless encounter to another. 
 ""The fact that he'd been the first guy I ever loved and the one who made me face some terrifying things about myself...well, all that will go unsaid."" 
 HIM is a feel-good sports romance that happens to feature two fabulously sexy male protagonists. It is perfect for die-hard readers of M/M romance as well as for readers who are new to the genre. I adored this book and hope that Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy collaborate on many more books in the future!

 The Score follows two characters from Elle's earlier books. Allie is a drama major and Dean is studying law. Allie may be my favorite Elle Kennedy heroine so far! She is smart, funny, and yes, emotional. At first I thought she was a little weak, coming off of her break-up with her boyfriend, but this girl knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it! 
 And DEAN...well, lets just say he started off with a bang for me, literally, plus I am one of those readers who loves a cocky guy! Dean comes from a wealthy family and he has certain expectations placed on him...what courses he'll study, what profession he'll go into...his whole life is mapped out for him. But he is HILARIOUS (hello, Twilight reference?) and on top of his sexiness, he is a sweet, caring guy. When he started coaching the kids' hockey team... well, let's just say I was a goner at that point. Oh, and did I mention Dean is a dirty-talker? YES, PLEASE! 
 ""I though you said you didn't want to salsa dance. And Dean De Laurentis only does what he wants, remember?"" 
 He shrugs. ""I am doing what I want."" 
 My eyebrows knit together as I wait for him to clarify. 
 ""I'm making you happy."" 
 Allie and Dean seem mismatched but guess what, they fit together perfectly! What's starts off as a sex-with-no-strings relationship of course turns into much more...but that is the beauty of Elle Kennedy's writing. There is nothing predictable here and there are tons of twists and turns along the way to Dean and Allie's HEA. With lots of witty banter and funny dialogue, smoking-hot sex and a little angst, THE SCORE is a fresh and modern romance that I devoured. I adored Dean and Allie together and can't wait for the next book! (What? Did you say Tucker?)

 Although Book #3 in Tessa Bailey's Broke and Beautiful series, this scorching book can be read and enjoyed as a standalone novel and is sexy, FUNNY and fast-paced. MAKE ME is pure Tess Bailey gold! Abby and Russell's story is an enjoyable, delicious book, written as always in the trademark Tess Bailey style of dirty-talking Alphas with a healthy dose of reality, humor and solid storyline. 
 I was hooked from the hilarious opening line of this book. Russell is a blue-collar construction worker who thinks he will never be good enough for Abby, who comes from a wealthy family but is insanely attracted to Russell. She doesn't quite know how to move their friendship to the next level. Russell, on the other hand, fantasizes constantly about the irresistible Abby and is driven by the need to protect her. Will these two ever be able to move their relationship past the dreaded friend zone? Tessa Bailey writes some of the best growly, sexy Alpha heroes and Russell is no exception. As with all of Ms. Bailey's books, you will need to have a cold shower ready while reading MAKE ME, but the sexiness is mixed in with the perfect amount of extremely witty banter and memorable characters. I absolutely loved this book and highly recommend it for all fans of scorching hot New Adult contemporary romance!

 I really liked FLAME! The storyline and the love scenes and the action scenes are all fantastic!! 
 Dakota finds herself taking a road trip with friends while she is on a break from school. Dakota goes along with Levi, Gunner and Emmy Sue on a trip for Levi and Gunner's motocross bike races. Levi is HOT but Dakota stays away from relationships. So this trip is perfect for the both of them: a hot hook-up with no promise of anything permanent. I loved Dakota's character: she is smart, strong-willed and not afraid to go after what she wants But when the road trip ends, will she be able to walk away from Levi? 
 Dakota is from an unconventional family and I love how her free spirit shines through in this book. Levi is immediately attracted to her spirit but he is very honest about not wanting anything more than sex while they are on the road. He doesn't ""do"" relationships either. But is he ever HOT!! 
 ""Sunshine,"" Levi leans over to me, resting his hand on the inside of my thigh, right below the frayed hem of my shorts, ""I promise I want to learn all about your family. They sound cool as fuck--especially the part about the weed farm--but can we get back to where you said motocross is driving fast and doing stupid, crazy-ass stunts while flying through the air? 'Cause if you're gonna be my girl on this trip, we need to give you a crash course tonight in all things motocross, so you can truly appreciate my awesomeness when you see me in action."" 
 These two have some great banter and the action scenes are incredible! Although this is the second book in a series, it can absolutely be read as a standalone.

 I absolutely adore R.S. Grey's books. She has a fresh wit, a wonderful way with banter and can write sexy times as well as the best erotica author. This book is pure fun, a feel-good, sexy read with a HEA and a Cinderella feel to the story. It is a modern tale of a small-town girl trying to make it in the Big Apple, living on a shoestring budget but trying in the best Mary-Tyler-Moore fashion ""to make it on her own."" 
 Jo is a scrappy heroine, and thrilled to land her dream job with a famous fashion house in New York City. Of course her boss is Mr. Sexy Julian Lefray, and the sparks fly between these two right from the get-up. I love a good male POV and Ms. Grey writes a great one! Plus, this book has the just right amount of sex, it was a great ""palate cleanser"" in between the super-steamy and graphic contemporary romance and erotic books I normally read. 
 This book is great if you are looking for a fun, light, sexy and witty book, with great banter between the hero and heroine and some really funny dialogue. It is a modern tale of love and sex and firendship in the big city and I highly recommend it. You can't go wrong with a book by R.S. Grey!

 ""You reminded me that there's still magic,"" he whispered roughly. ""That there are things of wonder still left to experience."" 
 I am a HUGE fan of MC Romance books and Cat Porter is at the top of my list of favorite authors in this genre! Lock & Key, the first book in this series, remains one of my all-time favorite books. Random & Rare contented the experience of her absolutely flawless writing and now we have the third book in the series, which is Boner and Jill's story. 
 Boner is a total bad-ass, who has been attracted to Jill for a long time but won't act on it. He's too old for her; she isn't sure she wants to go back to club life again; etc. etc. Jill had been with Catch, another biker and the father of her child, and it ended badly. But who can resist Boner, the sexy biker with a painful past? And how he got his road name...well, you'll have to read for yourself! It's not what you think. I fell in love with him and hoped that Jill could help him overcome his demons. 
 ""Was I only pieces patched together by a leather vest?"" 
 Even though Boner think Jill is off-limits, he offers her his protection and let's just say things progress from there. At first, their ""relationship"" is just for show but since this is a romance after all, they both quickly come to realize they have real feelings for each other. And the Victoria's Secret scene? Oh my God!!! My favorite. 
 I loved reading about Boner's painful past and the action scenes are fantastic. While this doesn't knock out Lock & Key as one of my all-time favorite books, it is a fantastic, sexy, fast-paced and passionate story which I enjoyed immensely. The Epilogue was superb! All in all, Iron & Bone is another must-read book from the incredibly talented Cat Porter.

 I don't know how she does it but Kristen Ashley has written yet another sparkling gem of a story. Emotional, heart-warming, sexy and heart-breaking, this book has EVERYTHING I love. There's a tough-talking, over-protective Alpha, a sweet and steely but damaged heroine and lots and lots of family goodness. There is nothing like a good, old-fashioned second-chance romance as only KA can do it!! 
 The 'Magadalene' series is one of my favorites and while this book can be read as a standalone, I HIGHLY recommend reading the other books in the series!! They are GOLDEN. Set in a beautiful Maine town, I thoroughly enjoyed the detailed descriptions of architecture, seasons, local food (of course) and the tight-knit bond of the local townspeople. This book launches right into the reasons why Cady has moved to town: she purchased the crumbling lighthouse because not only does her estranged brother live nearby, but the love of her life, Coert, is the sheriff. She is determined to make amends with both of them. But Coert makes it VERY clear right from the beginning that she is to stay away from him at all costs. What happened between them all those years ago to make him so bitter? And exactly how and why has Cady changed so much from the young rebellious girl she once was? 
 Cady and Coert's epic love began many years before in Colorado. Cady ran with a wild crowd and her family did not approve of her choices or her lifestyle. But Cady was always self-sufficient and independent and worked long hours at a dead-end job just to make ends meet. She wanted a better life for herself. She doesn't meet Coert under the best of circumstances but their love was real. A terrible turn of events tears them apart and just like that, the only beautiful thing Cady had was gone. 
 Cady and Coert then spend many years apart. When they meet again in Magdalene, they both have huge misconceptions about each other. But they are both older and wiser and hopefully won't make the same mistakes again. I absolutely LOVED how Kristen Ashley brought these two together again and I was literally sobbing reading much of this book. The story is long, it is weighty and it is hugely satisfying. 
 ""I was in love with Coert Yeager in a way that it just simply would never die."" 
 This glorious story features cameo appearances by characters from the 'Rock Chick' series (yay!) and it is filled with light and love and hope and smoking hot romance. Grab a bottle of wine, settle in and enjoy the ride!! Thanks again to Ms. Ashley for another unforgettable second-chance romance.

I did like the main characters and the New York setting. The writing is very good but I felt the story completely sugar-coated the jail setting; this is a fairy-tale, romanticized view of prison life. I also felt the ending was unrealistic with respect to Carter dealing with a corporate matter (I don't want to give away any spoilers here.)

 Heed the warnings on this one because Maldeamores is unlike amy book I've read. Belen and Luciano are star-crossed lovers, fiercely in love but forced to deny their true feelings for each other. Like Mara's other books, I felt anxious, emotional, distraught and fascinated by these two characters and their tumultuous journey. The writing is stunning, sharp and incredibly erotic and the characters richly detailed. I was drawn into their world and was stunned by the turn of the events. These two are truly ""lovesick"" and simply cannot live apart from each other. 
 There are some very graphic and steamy scenes in this book, but they fit in with the story and add fuel to the deep emotional bond Belen and Luciano share. If you like to be challenged and thrilled when you read, then Maldeamores is the book for you. It is not an easy story but I loved the rollercoaster ride of emotions! Mara White is a talent to watch and I hope she will keep on writing these complex, sexy stories.

 Parallel universes? Yes, please! I have always been intrigued with stories about the path not taken. The blurb of MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE intrigued me and made me think of one of my favorite movies, Sliding Doors. While this book was not all that I had hoped for, it is nonetheless a well-written, thought-provoking story about the consequences of our actions, fate and destiny. 
 Taylor Jenkins Reid brings a unique and fresh voice to the idea that our soul mates are out there, and that our choices lead us to our own realities. Both parallel stories in this book were engaging, REAL, and very original. The characters are all very relatable and some of their stories more poignant than others. 
 ""I know there may be universes out there where I made different choices and they led me somewhere else, led me to someone else. And my heart breaks for every single version of me that didn't end up with you."" 
 Our heroine Hannah takes two widely divergent paths, as does her best friend Gabby. I did feel an overriding sense of sadness while reading this book, which, happily, was replaced by joy by the end. MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE is a very thoughtful and interesting book, which will make you think about your choices in life, and whether fate ever really plays a part in our lives. Is everything all mapped out, occurring anyway no matter what our choices might be? There's lots to chew on here and I will say that I was totally surprised by the ending of this book. 
 I would have like a little more detail about some of the more meaningful events in this book. However, much of this story seems aimed at twenty-somethings who will very much enjoy Hannah's journey. I did feel that some important details were missing, but overall, both the writing and the story were very intriguing and fresh. 
 I read this in one sitting and I will definitely grab the author's other books now. Love, loss, family, friendship, loyalty -- they are all covered here and I think this is the perfect summertime read.",Tue Apr 14 20:44:55 -0700 2015,Sun Jul 12 21:54:59 -0700 2015,Sat Jul 11 00:00:00 -0700 2015,Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 -0700 2015,7,0

 ""Even the best of us isn't purely good. And even the worst of us isn't purely evil."" 
 This book is pure PERFECTION. My thought when finishing was, ""Now what do I read?!"" This is one of my top favorite series EVER. I am truly obsessed with this author and this story. Jonah and Vivienne are incredibly written characters, filled with depth and raw emotion. This is a very adult story, dealing with very adult subjects. With that said, these book are among the most highly erotic stories I have ever read. 
 This series is not for everyone, but if you like sexy, edgy, mature stories, then definitely give these books a try. Lilah Pace's writing captivated me and drew me into Jonah and Vivienne's story like very few authors can do. While the subject may seem very taboo, I found these books to be as much an exploration of women's sexuality as they are ""forbidden"" erotic romance. These stories take you on an emotional journey that is sensual, enthralling and addictive, to say the least. 
 BEGGING FOR IT is the conclusion to the series and picks up right where the first book ended. They must be read in order. These two characters are absolutely unforgettable, and I could not really fathom how they were going to make their very unorthodox relationship work. Jonah struggles with his own seemingly-insurmountable dark fantasies, while Vivienne also struggles to come to terms with her own deep-seated fears, as well as her very dysfunctional family. I literally raced through this book, fearful that the author was not going to give these two perfectly damaged souls the conclusion they were worthy of. I felt tremendous empathy for both of these characters and was deeply satisfied with the fantastic conclusion to their stories. I can't say enough about these books. They are thought-provoking, emotional and incredibly readable. 
 ""We don't get better; we don't fix everything that's broken. We just learn how to work around the broken bits. How to do the best we can with what we have, and who we are."" 
 I am completely OBSESSED with this author and cannot wait for whatever books she might have planned for the future. I hope there are more books under the name Lilah Pace - I will read anything she writes!

Lilah Pace has written an absolutely perfect story, filled with erotic moments, thrills, emotion and a gripping plot. Each and every character is perfectly drawn, richly detailed and essential to the story. I can't say enough about this book and the author stalking has already begun. Who is this Lilah Pace and why has she enthralled me so? 
 Vivienne is an art student at the University of Texas - Austin who has rape fantasies but they are rooted in a traumatic past event, and the many sessions with her therapist bring the story to light and perfectly frame the rest of the book. While some readers might be turned off by this story, I found it to be sexy, dramatic and addictive. She meets Dr. Jonah Marks, a gorgeous, brilliant and enigmatic professor in another department at UT, and through a series of very thrilling events, they begin a series of encounters. Certainly ""relationship"" might be too strong a word for what they do. But I can guarantee that you have never read scenes as hot as the scenes between Jonah and Vivi. 
 ""How did this man with the power to terrify me also become the one person who truly makes me feel safe?"" 
 They do reach a certain level of intimacy which is very beautiful and poignant all at once. Both Jonah and Vivi are richly written characters, very damaged for sure. There is nothing superficial about anything in this book and I was also absolutely entranced by the detail with which the author described the various settings in the book. From Austin to New Orleans, there is a level and richness of detail here that is greatly appreciated by this reader. 
 ""Jonah doesn't know me well enough to know that I'm always ready to protect myself. My guard is always up. Still, I like that he always considers my safety even in the maddened heat of our mutual fever."" 
 I highlighted a zillion passages in this book and I can't possibly include them all here. Asking for It blew me away and is without a doubt one of my top reads of the year.

 Bella is a strong heroine and Rafe is totally swoon worthy. In this story, he is the virginal one and Bella is the one who enjoys sex and is not afraid to be the bold one. Hpw refreshing! The Shameless Hour is funny, sexy and heartbreaking all at once. Sarina takes some serious themes and incorporates them seamlessly into her story but gives her characters a fantastic HEA. 
 Rafe is a hot soccer player who catches Bella's eye but who is inexperienced with women. He is a hard-working student from a close-knit family, quite the opposite of Bella. He is a wonderful character who is honest, trustworthy and gorgeous. But he doesn't just want a one-night stand with Bella. 
 ""Bella's enthusiasm had obliterated all of my caution. She wanted me. And I could no longer think of any reason why I couldn't have this."" 
 Bella is a surprisingly strong and funny heroine who is not afraid to be herself and is unapologetic about her sexuality. She is funny and sexy and I absolutely loved her! Sarina Bowen writes a memorable female character who has grit, backbone and smarts. She is wildly attracted to Rafe but refuses to have a relationship with him because, well, she just doesn't do relationships. But Rafe is persistent and these two build a solid friendship along with their very explosive chemistry. Will Rafe convince Bella that he is worth the risk? Will Bella be able to overcome the reputation that seems to follow her around school? Read The Shameless Hour, you will love the funny dialogue, great story and strong characters that Sarina Bowen has created.

 The Deal was a total surprise for me and was one of my favorite books of 2015 so far. It was fresh, sexy, smart and funny and I was soooo excited when I heard Elle Kennedy was writing a story about John Logan! I have been immersed in college romances lately, and The Mistake is now another one of my favorites in this genre. 
 Sure, not every college or college experience is like the setting of this story, but I adored the characters and their friends (well, excerpt for one) and their struggles to find themselves in what to me is also a great coming of age story. 
 John Logan is absolutely Book Boyfriend material! Swoon!! I fell in love with him as he tried to win Grace over. Ms. Kennedy's writing style is sexy, fast-paced, heartwarming and very funny, and this book was like unwrapping a delicious treat. I loved reading about the characters' backstories and loved the fabulous ending to this book. 
 The Mistake was a flirty, steamy and fast read and I am now an even bigger fan of Elle Kennedy's writing. I loved this book and I think everyone at some point in their life has experienced some if not all of the emotions that these characters experienced. The Mistake is another winner from Elle Kennedy!

There are lots of reviewers who refuse to read this book, and that's fine. But based on its merits, I enjoyed this MM romance that comes with a healthy dose of sarcasm. 
 Black Balled is a fairly quick read and is a parody of the indie book world, pairing a snarky book reviewer with tons of anxieties with an author who has tons of anger issues. The authors did a great job at the dual POV and really, when you peel away the layers of sarcasm and humor, the story is about finding yourself. 
 ""Larson knows who he is and he makes no excuses or apologies for it. He wears his flaws just as proudly as he does his attributes, for all to see, and for everyone to accept or reject-as the case may be because it makes no difference to him. He is comfortable in his own skin. That is probably because Larson is genuine. He doesn't wear layers of facades that need to be ripped away in order to find his inner soul; or his truth. He just puts it all out there without reservation. 
 Not like me."" 
 There is lots and lots of white-hot sex in this book and tons of great banter. If you go into Black Balled knowing it has a very different storyline, and that both characters have a wicked sense of humor, then you'll love this book!",Wed Mar 25 06:59:55 -0700 2015,Wed May 20 06:24:36 -0700 2015,Tue May 19 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,9,0

If you've read Men of Inked, then you will fall head over heels in love with Morgan (NICE NAME!!) DeLuca, a Gallo cousin and Alpha male extraordinaire. He is just out of the Army and looking for direction in life when he gets an offer from his Florida cousins to join the ALFA PI agency. He picks up and leaves Chicago and his meddling mother to start over again with a new job. 
 I loved how the Gallo family is woven into this story. If you haven't read Chelle's Men of Ink series, you are missing out! They are filled with love, big families, snappy banter and lots and lots of mind-blowing sexy times. Get right on that! 
 Sinful Intent is a fast-paced, steamy story involving Morgan's first job, investigating and protecting his first client, Race True, from harassing and threatening emails that have escalated. She is being blackmailed and he must find her tormenter. She is a buttoned-up, straight-laced corporate type, sexy but basically married to her job and she needs someone like Morgan in her life to add the spontaneity she has been sorely missing out on. 
 Chelle's books are steamy, entertaining and have some of the most creative sex scenes I have ever read. Morgan is just, WOW. Race and Morgan together are just explosive. I liked the suspense and mystery along with the funny moments sprinkled throughout the book. I really enjoyed this book. It is overall a very enjoyable, sexy story and a great start to a new series by one of my favorite authors.

 Ella Frank has written another sexy, gripping and character-driven book with TRUST! Are you new to the M/M genre? Then I highly recommend this series because the story is really about two people loving each other and fighting the same battles with family, work and external forces as everyone else. Oh, and there's some super-steamy sexy times to thrill you as well!! 
 Logan and Tate have both changed and grown in this fantastic series. 
 ""His motto of ""try, take, and top"" had changed. Oh, he'd tried Tate all right, and they'd both done a helluva lot of taking, but for once in his life, Logan didn't feel the desire to win. He didn't need to come out on top. What he wanted was Tate's trust--his absolute trust."" 
 Logan and Tate have made great strides in their relationship but Tate is still holding back. He and Logan are in love, yes, but is that always enough to sustain a long, happy and healthy relationship? Ella Tate's wonderful writing style kept the story flowing until the end, and there are some dramatic surprises in store for our gorgeous heroes which kept my heart racing until the very end! 
 Once the calm after the storm had settled, Logan moved up his body, and Tate wrapped his arms around him. As they both lay there, in the silence of the room, neither one of them said a word-- because, really, there was nothing to add to such perfection. 
 I highly recommend this series to all fans of contemporary romance. The story is enthralling and the characters memorable. And I absolutely adored the wonderful and satisfying ending for the sexy Logan and Tate.

 Yearning and desperation. Two feelings perfectly conveyed by the author in Deep Blue Eternity. I can't stop thinking about this book! A beautifully written, haunting story of two very lost souls, Natasha Boyd also injects some much-needed humor and a whole lot of sexy into this magnificent book. 
 Livvy has run away to her grandmother's old island cottage and is quite shocked to find a caretaker named Tom living there. They begin a tentative and uneasy living situation but of course there is much more than meets the eye here. They are both frightened in their own way, both trying to escape brutal and heartbreaking pasts off the coast of South Carolina. Both are harbouring some very, very sad secrets and both are seeking healing, maybe in each others' arms. But Tom pushes Livvy away, she is very young and he cannot tell her why he is keeping her at a distance. 
 ""I mean, I thought we had a... a friendship or something, and I don't understand what I've done wrong."" Addressing it made a weird emotional bubble grow in my chest, and my eyes started to sting. 
 Livvy tries to begin a new life by finding a job at a local cafe and befriending the residents. But Tom battles his true feelings for her and settles on a friendship, as well as protecting her from the local bad boys. 
 ""Lifting my arms tentatively, I slid them around his waist. I thought I felt him shudder. His muscles were bunched tight, or he was tense. I didn't know. He was hugging me. I could hug him back, right?""

 ""He was my truth. Even if that made me a sinner."" 
 I expect nothing less than total perfection from Penelope Ward and she delivers another very sexy, very emotionally satisfying story with Sins of Sevin. This book is the perfect cure for any kind of book slump you might be in. The characters are all richly written, the story is very different and creative, and the emotions this book inspires will have you wishing you there was more to this story. I did not want it to end! 
 Sins of Sevin, told in alternating POV's, is about a fundamentally Christian household where the daughters must be courted before marriage by a man who has been chosen by the family. No kissing, no touching no NOTHING before marriage. The problem is, that Sevin is promised to a girl he does not love. His heart belongs to another. There are many factors at play here as to why he cannot be with the one he loves, his true soul mate, and these obstacles only make Sevin to be an even stronger, heartbreaking hero than is already is. 
 ""You can't choose love. It chooses you, and once that happens, it doesn't let you go. You can pretend it's not there but when you try, it only fights harder...louder...until you finally get the message and give in."" 
 I do not read many other ""taboo"" romance books other than Penelope Ward. She is the Queen, bar none, of the forbidden romance genre. Sins of Sevin is another fantastic forbidden romance with a hero that I fell in love with from the first page. This book is filled with lots of anguish, emotion and plenty of guilt on the part of both main characters but the writing in this book flows so beautifully that even the most cynical reader with fall in love with Sevin (and MAYBE Evangeline!). 
 Ms. Ward's story spans several years in time, which adds to the richness of the story. I honestly could not tell where this story was going end up, and the ending truly did surprise me. And please, have plenty of tissues handy for the Epilogue to this beautifully sexy and very loving book. 
 ""I have so much love inside of me that's all yours, and it's been trapped inside. I need to give it to you, because holding it in is killing me. I know your heart belongs to me. But I'm selfish. I want all of you. I want you."" 
 Sevin and Evangeline are far from perfect. Both make choices that I did not agree with. But I absolutely fell in love with Sevin and with this story. Do not miss it. Sins of Sevin is a must-read!

Soaring is classic Kristen Ashley, filled with love, family, a helluva sexy Alpha hero and lots more love. What is different about Soaring is that Amelia is far from perfect. She is a seriously flawed heroine who has made some very bad choices in her life. Those actions have had serious consequences including the loss of the custody of her children. But she is bound and determined to change her life, get her kids back and maybe, just maybe, fall in love again. 
 Ms. Ashley fills Amelia's house with good friends and lots of family. Fences are mended and hearts are repaired along the way. But it is not an easy path, as Amelia has alienated most of her family and must hide her shattered heart in order to put things right again. We absolutely loved how the author really nailed what it's like to live with teenagers, and loved the scenes with Amelia's kids and Mickey's kids as well. 
 Mickey has also had a rough past and resists falling for his gorgeous neighbor. He is a good man and might be one of our favorite KA heroes ever. Strong, sexy, low-key....yes, please!! And he accepts Amelia for who she is and doesn't judge her based on her past behavior. 
 ""The mistakes we make in life don't define us, Amy. The way we handle 'em after makin' 'em do."" 
 This is an EPIC love story. We ""soared"" right along with Amelia and Mickey. We also loved how Amelia finally, for the first time in her life, stands on her own two feet and stands up to her awful, low-life ex-husband Conrad. And she does so without harming her children along the way. 
 We love a strong heroine and Amelia turns out to be just that. Smart, beautiful and loving, it was a pleasure reading about a heroine who was over 40 and had LIVED a life. Soaring is a gritty, sexy, beautiful story. Don't miss this one!!

 I want to thank Ms. Douglas for writing an exciting, very adult contemporary romance that hits all the high notes. Misconduct was a pure pleasure to read, from the well-drawn characters, to the New Orleans setting, to the damaged family relationships that were the center of this book. This book is one of my top favorites of the year, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. 
 If you like to get lost in a book, then Misconduct is for you. The sexy, sultry New Orleans setting; the smart, successful, handsome, yet damaged hero; the beautiful but skittish heroine, all of these add up to an unputdownable story. This book is very different from the Fall Away series except for the unparalleled writing. This story is for adults, it is erotic, sexy, poignant, exciting and thrilling. What more could you ask for in a book? 
 Tyler and Easton are two of the standout main characters that I have read this year. And I have read a LOT. I read an early paperback copy so I dog-eared almost every single page of my copy!! Here's a peek: 
 ""I should go home. 
 But he kept wanting me. 
 He kept tapping at my shell like I was an egg he needed to crack. And while I constantly felt like goo that would spill everywhere if not protected by my hard outer armor, he made me feel like I didn't need it."" 
 Exceptional writing; an exciting, fast-paced story; all the right emotions ... this book has it all. And THE most important factor for me when reading is a connection to the main characters. I felt a deep connection not only with Tyler and Easton, but felt THEIR connection and their love. 
 Put Misconduct on your must-read list. It is an outstanding story!

Home Again is another sexy and sweet story where family is first, the characters get their HEA, and the sex is SMOKING hot. This book is told is a series of flashbacks which alternate with present day, focusing on Noah and Clark, who first meet when they are teenagers. I love how this author spotlights the importance of friends who accept you, but also being true to yourself. There is some angst in this book but you just know the main characters will work everything out. The story is clever and the alternating POV's are refreshing. Oh and of course, the chemistry between Noah and Clark is off-the-charts hot and the sex scenes are absolutely amazing. Loved the twist at the end!

 This book picks up right after the conclusion to MANWHORE. Rachel has publicly embarrassed her boyfriend Malcolm Saint and is in deep despair of ever repairing their relationship. Katy Evans writes a beautifully flowing yet very fast-paced and verrrrry sexy story here as we experience the deep heartache that Rachel feels. 
 ""This is what I've been waiting for, for four weeks. This is what I wanted when I left a thousand messages on his phones and what I wanted when I wrote a thousand others that I left unsent. To see him. 
 For him to want to see me."" 
 There's plenty of office drama, too, as Rachel's dream job seems to be in jeopardy due to a bidding war over the ownership of the company where she works. One of the things I love about this author is that her heroes, no matter how tortured, always have the ability the love deeply and Saint is no exception. Despite his reputation, he really cares deeply for Rachel and their scenes together are perfect. 
 I definitely recommend this series if you love a contemporary, witty, and passionate story with a great cast of supporting players. I also loved that there might be another story here for Gina and Tahoe? Things seem to be pointing in that direction and I would love to read more about them! I can't wait to see what's next for Rachel and Saint and am anxiously awaiting Ms. Manwhore!

 MAVERICK!!!! I think I'm in LOVE. Katy Evans has created a gorgeous, sensitive beast of a man. Another legend is born. 
 Legend is the kind of Katy Evans book that I love, filled with passion, emotion, tons of sexy times and a deep emotional connection between the two main characters. This book goes back to the roots of the series, an lonely underdog fighting against the world, and a sweet, kind woman who is swept away by his passion. 
 Maverick ""the Avenger"" Cage is an outcast in the underground fighting world. But he knows he can be the best if only someone would give him a chance and train with him. The best he can do is a down-and-out trainer named Oz. Reese is Remy's wife Brooke's cousin, and is traveling with them on the fighting circuit while taking care of their son, Racer. She is a loner, shy, and never thinks someone like Maverick would be interested in her. 
 ""I wanted to be understood, and I wanted to be known. And I wanted to be loved."" 
 I LOVE a good underdog story and Legend fits the bill perfectly. There are no over-the-top characters here, just two people who are searching for something that they never had. And when Maverick and Reese get together, WOW!!!! Hello, new favorite book boyfriend!! 
 ""Don't go after her if you don't think you can deserve her."" He hits me again and I block, then jab him. He eases back and prowls around. So do I. 
 ""Deserve her first. Then go after her."" 
 Reese and Maverick have a forbidden romance at first, because Maverick is in training to ultimately fight Remington ""Riptide"" Tate and challenge him for the championship. And nothing will stand in his way. But the truth comes out and Reese must decide whose corner she is really in. There's no question that Maverick is all hers, and he is the kind of man that knows when he has found the woman for him. I loved that Reese is not perfect, and the author makes sure to point out her insecurities. This is the kind of book that Katy Evans does best, filled with fierce warmth, hotness and a brute of a hero with a heart of gold. Maverick is EVERYTHING. I adored Legend and it is the perfect entry in the REAL series of books.

 Harper Sloan keeps getting better and better! I loved this book! The author has created more characters to fall in love with. Cohen and Dani are absolutely irresistible and their story was steamy, emotional, passionate and beautiful. This story has the perfect blend of sexy, heart-warming, funny and tension. I read this book in one sitting and really feel that it is one of Harper's best books. 
 Dani is a sweet girl and knows from an early age that Cohen is her man. The problem is her overprotective Alpha father kept her almost locked away and she never thought that Cohen saw her as anything but the best friend's little sister. I loved that she really was honest with Cohen, she didn't try and hide her feelings. That was a refreshing twist for me. 
 Cohen is another gorgeous, sexy Alpha as only Harper Sloan can create. He is brave, loving and will do anything to protect his girl. He never forgot Dani or gave up on them, even when he was in the middle of combat. 
 ""Right in the middle of that Hell-on-earth chaos, I would hear her words trail through my thoughts right when I needed an extra push of strength or, God forbid, hope. I think that was the moment that I realized the enormity of it and that confession whispered all those years ago. Right or wrong, whatever it is between us would always be bigger than I understand. It's something that was so unexpected-- that feeling, craving, desire, to make her mine. It's something I've almost felt guilty about over the years."" 
 Unexpected Fate is a thrilling, totally sexy story filled with family, love and emotion. I highly recommend it for all fans of Harper Sloan and for anyone who loves a fast-paced, steamy story. This story has a fabulous and satisfying ending and I can't wait for more books in this series!

 Hello, Elle Kennedy! Thank you for this perfect blend of sexy, sweet and funny! The Deal is a palate cleanser, the kind of book that is a refreshing change of pace from dark, angsty, over-emotional stories. Even if you are not usually a fan of college romances, take a chance on The Deal, you won't be disappointed. Hannah is a smart, hard-working, self-sufficient music major, talented and unfortunately very closed off to any sort of interpersonal relationships. Garrett is a hockey player (Hello!! New favorite sport!), and a ""player"" in every other sense of the word. He is required to maintain a certain GPA to play on the team and for this, he needs a top-notch tutor for one of his classes. Enter Hannah. Excerpt that she absolutely refuses to have anything to do with Garrett. 
 There is so much more to Garrett than meets the eye. I loved how he slowly breaks down Hannah's resistance and she discovers, to her total surprise, that he is actually an incredibly decent and yes, very irresistible guy. The Deal is a wonderfully layered story, with the characters getting to know one another and slowly developing a bond. There are no contrived situations here or over-the-top plot developments. The story is pure gold and I absolutely loved every single word of it! (There was only one ""oops"" moment in this story which hopefully won't reappear in The Mistake - American college students don't use ""meters"" to describe measurements - they would use feet.) 
 There are also fabulous supporting characters here and I can't wait for their stories. Elle Kennedy has become a new favorite of mine and I look forward to reading more from her. Here are some of my favorite quotes from The Deal: 
 I have to say, this is the first time a girl's been worried about getting caught in my bedroom. Normally they strut out like they've just bagged Brad Pitt. 
 Hannah takes a breath. ""We studied. We watched TV. I went home late. That's what happened. Got it?"" 
 I fight back laughter. ""As you wish."" 
 ""Did you really just Princess Bride me?"" 
 ""Did you really just use Princess Bride as a verb?"" 
 She glowers.

 I absolutely loved this passionate and moody story and I need closure on Kes and Aimee's story, like, yesterday! I can't stop thinking about these characters. This is one of those very broody, very memorable stories that really gets under your skin. The first half of this book completely swept me away and immersed me into the small-town, Midwestern setting. Kestrel and Aimee had a simmering, sizzling attraction that grew from their close friendship as children. Kes, a bruised and battered soul, found something in Aimee that he could cling to and that would give him a glimmer of hope in his stolen youth. 
 Kes was put to work in a traveling carnival at a young age, and while Aimee sees the carnival as a magical, almost mystical lifestyle, Kes sees the much harsher side of ""carnie"" life. His carnival returns to her small town each summer for 2 weeks, and their unlikely friendship blossoms over the years into a sexy, heated, full-blown relationship. 
 ""Fate was against us. Screw that! Kes was moody and difficult, brilliant and beautiful. He scared me and protected me."" 
 Years pass, and finally Kes and Aimee might have the chance as adults to explore their searing and unbreakable bond. Kes has becom a star within the fair circuit, with women throwing themselves at him, as they did when he was younger. Aimee is a schoolteacher, living a safe and plain existence in a town in New England. What will happen when they are reunited? 
 ""He was everything i wasn't, but somehow, together, there was a synergy, an alignment, something that just made sense."" 
 The first half of this book literlly blew me away! I could not put it down. The tone changed slightly in the second half but yet I am still 100% invested in this story and I cannot wait to see what the author has in store for these characters in the next book! Please note that this is book #1 in a series with somewhat of a sudden ending but I highly recommend it. Prepare to fall in love with Kes!

 What an amazing story!! Lust, sex, chemistry and tons of action fill Mel and Painter's story. Never a dull moment here and the sex is OFF. THE. CHARTS. There's lots of MC goodness, because there is a fantastic epilogue PLUS other treats in store for readers of Reaper's Fall!! 
 I ADORE Joanna Wylde's writing. She writes MC romance with a certain excitement but also realism that is absolutely addictive. Every one of her men is rough, sexy and real. Reaper's Fall is Painter and Melanie's story and uses one of my favorite tropes, the lovers-to-enemies theme. Their early contact is really limited to just letters while Painter is in prison. The build-up is slow and delicious and when they break apart, as you know that they will, it is emotional and heartbreaking and fiery. I literally devour every book by Joanna Wylde and Reaper's Fall was no different. Although the characters from previous books appear here, this book can abaolutely be read as a standalone but I LOVED seeing all of my ""old friends"". 
 These books are rouch, they are messy, there is not always hearts and flowers. Melanie doesn't always make the right decisions but what I love about Ms W writing is that her characters are always trying to better themselves, and Melanie is no different. And Painter makes no apologies for who he is, and when he and Melanie get together, it is pure heat and emotion. 
 Melanie is very stubborn and rebels against the MC. The actions of the club members are not sugar-coated here but that makes Melanie and Painter's journey that much more bittersweet. And did I mention there's plenty of humor here to balance out the raw passion and emotion and incredibly steamy sex?? 
 ""If I had to fall in love with an asshole, at least he was a hot asshole."" 
 I will read every single book that Joanna Wylde writes. Every story from Ms. Wylde delivers the goods. And, as an added bonus here, there is a FANTASTIC Epilogue!! I can't wait for the next book from this fabulous author.

Her characters feel real and each book is raw, sexy and fresh. Silver Bastard is no different, it is a thrill-ride from beginning to end. I fell in love with the two main characters and I absolutely adored Becca, she is a kick-ass heroine who is fighting for a better life and does so with humor and strength. 
 We first met Puck in Reapers Stand and now it is five years later as Puck is out of prison after taking the fall for his MC. His first night of freedom and he meets Becca, in an awkward situation that turns ugly very fast. Puck is a stand-up guy and he basically saves Becca's life. Several years later, Becca is living in a small town in Northern Idaho, working and attending school. She is only 21 but is much older than her years. 
 Becca knows that Puck is not the right guys for her, she has been trying to avoid trouble since she left home 5 years before. But the problem is that Puck can't stay away from Becca and feels protective of her in every sense. They fight, they argue, they battle, but this book is so filled with humor and fast-paced action that the classic ""will-they-won't they"" feels fresh and new and exciting. I couldn't put this book down! Silver Bastard is one of my favorite Joanna Wylde books and I have read them all. 
 Puck can't stay away from Becca and he is an Alpha MC biker so... you can guess where things lead. Joanna Wylde's incredibly steamy scenes between Puck and Becca and the fantastic storyline kept me hooked from the very beginning. I can't say enough about her writing and her MC books. Although there are many serious and dark issues raised in this book, our hero and heroine eventually get their HEA (of course) and the funny and witty dialogue provided a welcome relief from all the drama. 
 I love all Joanna Wylde's characters and I was excited to see some other characters introduced here. As usual, I can't wait for her next book. If you love great writing with tons of steamy scenes and some rough and gritty drama, then you will love Silver Bastard.

 Frederick and Simon meet by chance and once again, Cardeno C.'s incredibly loving, warm and sweet style took over to give these two the full life they had both been missing. 
 Blue Mountain is a fairly short story, but is a wonderful, sweet addition to the author's work. Although Simon and Frederick are only really together towards the end of the story, the story and the characters really mesh perfectly together and I loved the direction the story took. I absolutely adored the narrator of this audiobook, even though I liked him best as the voice for Frederick and Mitch. I would like to hear Sean Crisden again as the narrator in future audiobooks.

 Swoon!!! Ladies and gentleman, meet Gray Grayson and prepare to fall in LOVE!! 
 THE FRIEND ZONE is a super-funny, very steamy, and very romantic sports romance that I absolutely adored. It can be read as a standalone although two characters from The Hook-Up make appearances here. If you are looking for a fast-paced, clever story, then THE FRIEND ZONE is for you. 
 I think one of my favorite quotes of the year so far has to be from this book: 
 ""I'm trying to commiserate, you noodle. Because the itching was torture when it grew back. And do not get me started on the pain of waxing. I was certain that evil woman had ripped my lady lips off."" 
 ""Lady lips? Oh Christ."" His gleeful laughter echoes through the stadium. 
 ""This is so not funny,"" I protest, my hands on my hips as his abs clench--which, unf--and he cracks up. ""It was the worst pain of my life. And I've broken my arm in two places."" 
 Lady lips! I love it! But the story is great and the supporting characters all vital to the story and just as interesting as Gray and Ivy. Ivy has vowed never to do casual hook-ups, especially with an athlete. Her sports-agent father's lifestyle turned her off to that. And Gray isn't interested in a monogamous relationship, until of course, he meets Ivy. 
 This book is extremely clever and the author creates a real and meaningful friendship between Ivy and Gray. Their relationship is believable, sweet and honest, and so their eventual sexy times did not feel rushed at all, but instead felt like a perfectly natural progression of their growing passion. 
 And speaking of sex, did I mention that Gray is irresistible? Yep, perfect boyfriend material. The nighttime stadium scene? I died a little. He's an intelligent and incredibly gifted athlete with a bright future ahead if only he can withstand his sorry excuse for a family. 
 ""To me it's a cathedral. I sit here and I feel calm, centered. And yet it's like all the energy of games past remains, coursing through my veins, and I can't wait for the next game."" 
 These two are meant for each other, it's just that they don't quite realize it at the beginning: 
 ""His forearm tenses, and I find him staring at me with wide eyes. Pain resides there, and a sort of longing too. I recognize it in myself -- that need to have someone understand how empty life can feel, as if you're the only one in your universe. 
 Gray holds my gaze for another second then clears his throat. ""Shit, Mac, you're going to have me bawling like a baby soon."" He gives me a lopsided smile."" 
 Ivy and Gray care deeply for each other; they both had sad and lonely lives when they were younger, some of which has spilled over into their young adult lives and which has brought them closer together. But never fear, the author watches over your heart and doesn't let anything too painful happen to it. 
 Gray falls for ivy, despite his surprise at the depth of his feelings for her. It was actually quite beautiful to watch his feelings unfold 
 ""And that strange dichotomy is my Ivy. Insane planner mixed with a free spirit who goes with the flow. A surge of affection hits me, and I sink further into the pillows."" 
 Lest I forget to rave about the sexy times, they are HAWT!! Take one 6'6'' football player who weighs well over 200 pounds, with a drop-dead body and a very sensitive and loving soul and you have the recipe for PERFECT sex! And they both like to act out fantasies. THUD. 
 There are some very serious and sensitive moments in The Friend Zone, but they are handled with sensitivity and grace by the author. And the Epilogue was perfect! Not completely unexpected but tender and loving nonetheless.",Thu Jan 15 17:19:14 -0800 2015,Tue May 05 02:18:22 -0700 2015,Mon May 04 00:00:00 -0700 2015,Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 -0700 2015,3,0

 Pucked is a witty story about Violet, who has a super funny and very inappropriate mother and a whore of a stepbrother who plays for the the NHL. So she has stayed away from hockey players until she meets Alex, the captain of the Rangers. All that goes out the widow. The writing is funny and light and the sex is great. There is no angst or heavy themes in this book. It is raunchy, funny and filled with tons of sexy times. If you're a fan of sports romance, you'll love this book - Pucked is the perfect, fast-paced summer read!

This is a great debut from Stephanie Rose! I loved the story and absolutely loved the plot. This is an emotional story that grabbed me from the first page. 
 Samantha is stuck in a loveless and heartless marriage and re-connects via Facebook with Lucas, her former college advisor. It is clear from the outset that Sam is with the wrong guy in more ways than one. Her husband Marc is an absentee husband and father. Lucas is wonderful to Sam and her daughter Bella, and Lucas and Bella's relationship makes up much of the heart of this story, it is just amazing. 
 Lucas is, well, irresistible. He is smart, uber-sexy, respectful and H-O-T. Just what Sam needs. And when things with Marc take a nasty turn, Lucas is right there with Sam, supporting her emotionally, and ready to love Bella and Sam forever. Lucas is an amazing character and a perfect book boyfriend!! There are some really romantic scenes in Always You that touched me and melted my heart. As you can probably see, Sam was married when she first reconnects with Lucas but trust me, Marc is a horrible person who needed to be dealt with. Sam just didn't have to courage to act until Lucas came into the picture. 
 There is lots of sexy time and sweet and sexy texting between our Hero and heroine. This book was surprisingly hot, very readable and enjoyable for all fans of steamy contemporary romance. The last scenes in the book were especially touching. I highly recommend this book for romance fans who like some steam to go along with their HEA.

 Silas and Charlie's epic journey continues! I'm a huge fan of this series and Part 2 did not disappoint! Another fantastically thrilling and creative story from Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher. 
 ""Never forget, Charlie. 
 Never stop."" 
 NEVER NEVER PART TWO is another completely gripping and thrilling story that continues literally from where Part One left off. The characters continue to enthrall and the plot continues to thicken in the second installment of this very strange tale. Ms. Hoover and Ms. Fisher are two of my favorite authors so it is no surprise that I loved this book and read it in just one sitting. 
 The feeling of disorientation continued in this story and I could not wait to see where Silas and Charlie's journey would go. Alas... more questions are raised and only a few answers are revealed. To me, this is not a paranormal story even though there are elements of what might be the supernatural here. I was very surprised by the turn of events here and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next story. 
 We again have both POVs, which flowed perfectly and added to my enjoyment of the book. Leave it to these two authors to both grip my heartstrings with Silas and Charlie's story, and leave me feeling like I stepped off a roller-coaster ride, all at the same time. 
 As you can see, these books are not standalones but if you like a twisty, thrilling, beautifully-written story, then don't miss Never Never. I absolutely adore this series and need the conclusion, like, NOW!!",Mon Jan 12 22:35:26 -0800 2015,Tue May 19 07:09:17 -0700 2015,Wed May 13 00:00:00 -0700 2015,Mon May 11 00:00:00 -0700 2015,11,4

 IT ENDS WITH US is one of THE most important books you'll read this year, maybe ever. It is absolutely stunning. There are very few books that I recommend to my daughter to read but this book is one of them. This story should be read by every woman, husband, boyfriend, son and brother because it contains one of the most powerful messages I have ever experienced. 
 On the surface this book is the story of Lily, who has escaped to Boston from the small town she grew up in. Smart and driven, she opens her own shop and meets Ryle, a funny, handsome and brilliant surgeon. Revealing anything more about this book would do a tremendous disservice to the perfect way that Colleen Hoover has told this story. It builds slowly, bit by bit, to a painful and inevitable conclusion that took my breath away. 
 As with all Colleen Hoover's books, IT ENDS WITH US is a stunner, magnificently written and absolutely unputdownable. My heart almost stopped in several places. It's that good!! Do yourself a favor and read this book - you will never forget it.

 I love a sweet, sexy, hot and romantic story, and The Pact is all this and more! Add a charismatic and irresistible Scotsman? YES, PLEASE! Karina Halle hits another home run with this incredibly engaging and modern tale of dating, love and romance. This is a fun, fast-paced and very enjoyable read and a little bit of a different type of book for this author. And I loved every word. Linden and Stephanie are two incredibly engaging characters, both very endearing and sometimes maddening and in the end, just plain human, with all the insecurities, longings and sometimes-dysfunctional relationships that most of us deal with into our adulthood. 
 These two are best friends, but also find each other irresistible. But they are terrified of ruing their close friendship by becoming involved romantically. So, they make a pact. At Linden's suggestion, they agree at age 25 that if they are not married by the age of 30, then they will marry each other. Sounds like a good idea, no? But the problem is that no one else can measure up to the other during all the years in between. At times, I just wanted to scream, ""Get together already!!"" 
 ""I sip my drink and can't help but feel the slightest bit relieved. In five years, all the dating and the strife could be over. In five years, there's the tiniest possibility that I could marry my best friend."" 
 Linden is hot hot hot and the kind of guy that every girl swoons over. He can't seem to fully give himself to anyone and of course, is madly in love with Stephanie. She, however, is not quite sure if he was just kidding about the pact, but she, too, can't seem to find true love, either. 
 ""I want to tell her all the filthy things I think about, be real, raw and unfiltered. I want to make her cheeks flush from my dirty mouth and her body with desire."" 
 Oh, yes, Linden is a dirty talker. Will they finally see through their stubborn resolve and give in to the feelings they have for each other? Things seem to come to a head during a camping weekend and they both seem to finally see the light. Finally! But will they be able to withstand all the outside forces and their own insecurities to be able to really make their incredible bond last? 
 The Pact has one of the most romantic and heart-pounding endings I have ever read. I was alternately swooning and crying. Karina Halle has written a perfect contemporary romance - it has a believable and relatable hero and heroine, modern settings, real-life problems and lots and lots of incredibly steamy, off-the-charts sex!! Issues with friendships, dating, jobs, family -- this book has it all. I loved this book and fell in love with Linden. Highly recommended for all fans of modern romance!

 I absolutely loved Fighting Silence! Till Page is a memorable character that I won't soon forget! Struggling against dirt-poor poverty, absentee parents and an inevitable loss of his hearing, this book pulled at my heartstrings and thrilled me from beginning to end. 
 Till is a fighter, taking care of his younger brothers to keep them out of the social services system. His only bright spot in an otherwise dismal existence is his neighbor Eliza Reynolds, who he spends every minute with after school, but who he completely ignores during the day. 
 She is just a gorgeous person, inside and out, and Till is frightened of ruining their relationship with sex, so... they spend part of the book battling their attraction to each other. 
 ""Eliza was a crier. She pretended that it was only when she was mad. That was bullshit though. She cried every time the wind blew north. Happy, sad, angry--it didn't matter. I loved it when she happy cried. I laughed when she angry cried. I was gutted when she sad cried. I'd held her through all of them. But her reaction that night was extraordinary. I guessed my present was pretty extraordinary too though."" 
 Eliza is sensitive but strong. I loved that about her character! This is not a typical fighter story, it is fresh and new and make no mistake, Till and ""Doodle"" BURN up the pages when they get together. This story is told in alternating POV's and flashes forward in time but Aly Martinez does an amazing job with the alternating voices. 
 This is a story of true devotion, fighting for happiness and fighting for the right to love and be loved. Sounds sappy, but this book is so much more! I loved it! 
 ""Till and I both knew we had a strange relationship. It was more than a friendship, but there wasn't romance or sex. There was definitely love though. Immeasurable amounts of it. I knew that Till had this grand fantasy about me. But what he didn't realized was all that he gave me in return. He was the only thing I'd ever had that I honestly thought I couldn't live without. Till Page was my soulmate on every level.""",Sun Dec 14 22:27:17 -0800 2014,Wed Feb 25 08:18:27 -0800 2015,Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 -0800 2015,Mon Feb 23 00:00:00 -0800 2015,10,0

 This was my first book by Monica Murphy and it was brilliant! It exceeded all expectations and I am anxiously awaiting the next book in this series. 
 Sexy, adult, erotic, this book has it all. Owning Violet introduces us to three sisters ""born to wealth, raised to succeed, ready to love, destined to make waves."" As the daughters of the scion of a world-famous fragrance company (it brought Estee Lauder to mind), Violet and her sisters are all very different but all intimately entwined with the future of their family's company. 
 Violet at first seems like a push-over and a doormat, her boyfriend almost openly cheats on her but she looks the other way, all in the name of the company. But I found her to be a compelling character, driven, eager to love and be loved, and above all, very ambitious. This book literally has it all: highly erotic sex scenes, an Alpha male and lots and lots of edge-of-your seat drama. 
 Ryder is a sexy bad-boy co-worker who rose above his rough past to work in corporate America. Violet may appear to have it all, but she experienced a terrible trauma that is still haunting her to this day. While we might first see her as nothing more than a pawn in a rather sick game between Ryder and Pilar, a scheming woman who wants to bring her down, she is much, much more that that. Violet is no pawn and slowly begins to realize that the sexual relationship she has with Ryder might be much, much more and she must find her inner strength to beat Pilar at her own game. 
 Owning Violet is an adult, erotic, steamy book and I loved the story and the amazingly intense scenes with her and Ryder. He is hot as hell, damaged, sexy, smart and ambitious. The steam factor was just genius. All in all, I loved this book and can't wait to read more from this author. I recommend this for anyone who loves a sexually-charged, fast-paced storyline with some very memorable characters.

 ""You make hell feel like heaven, Blaire."" 
 WOW!!!! This series is one of the most readable series out there. Mia Asher is why I read contemporary romance. From the first page to the every last word, I was hooked, invested in the story and emotionally connected to the characters. If you have read the first book, EASY VIRTUE, then you know that Blaire is then between two men, Ronan and Lawrence. Who will win her heart? Will either of them? 
 Tonight I let a man f* my brains out so he could eradicate a different man from my heart. I've done it before but, this time, it didn't work. Ronan was everywhere. In every kiss and every touch. He still is. 
 Ronan and Lawrence. Two irresistible men, both owning part of Blaire's heart, but in different ways. I can't decide which one I loved more, the author did an outstanding job creating two men who both stole my heart. Although Blaire and Lawrence's relationship was originally based on an arrangement for sex only, he became someone who Blaire could really fall in love with. But there's Ronan, always Ronan, on her mind and in her heart. 
 Ronan has become embittered, jaded and filled with hate for Blaire. But the fantastic way in which the author tells the story here in multiple POV's had me racing through the story to see where it would end up. I did not want poor Ronan to be so bitter! He tries to erase Blaire from his mind but she is always there. 
 When my lips touch hers , she closes her eyes and gives in to the kiss. I don't. I can't. And I f*king hate myself for it because even though I'm kissing this woman, it's Blaire who I taste. 
 I absolutely LOVED the conclusion to this story. It is rare for me to love a sequel as much as the first book but SWEETEST VENOM is pure gold. I applaud Mia Asher for the ending she gave to her characters here and dare I even hope that there could be more books with some of these characters? I will never forget Blaire, Ronan and Lawrence.

 What a raw, beautiful and unflinching look into the world of the one percenters! This is NOT a pretty story - it is filled with lust and mayhem and violence - but it perfectly tells the story of Eva's parents, Preacher and Wheels (Debbie). 
 This is one of my top favorite series EVER and I highly recommend reading the books in order. BUT you can read the first book right away to get a flavor for Madeline Sheehan's writing. 
 Preacher lived an entire lifetime before we ever met Eva as a young child in 'Undeniable.' His life was hard. But he was a survivor. 
 ""Prison had been a painful wake-up call for Preacher. It had taken the man he'd been, beaten the holy hell out of him, flushed him down the shitter, and sputtered and spit him back out a ravaged and shameful shell."" 
 Preacher met Debbie on the road. She, too, was a survivor and did what she had to do to get by on the streets. Madeline Sheehan took two very damaged and hardened souls and created something beautiful which is why I absolutely love her writing style. 
 The book is told as a flashback as Preacher lays dying in the hospital. He is finally telling his story to his beloved daughter Eva. But everything I thought I knew about Preacher and Debbie was wrong! Preacher's tale is heartbreaking but I could not put this book down. I had to see it thought to the end. 
 Preacher was in the biker life no matter what. Loyal and true to his family and biker brothers no matter what, he was a Demon through and through. 
 ""According to the law and the state of New York, he was indeed a free man. But in reality, he wasn't free at all. He belonged to the Silver Demons body and soul, for better or worse. And if he stayed on this path, this wasn't going to be the last time he went to prison."" 
 Heart-wrenching and gritty, 'Undeserving' is nonetheless an incredibly readable story. It must be experienced. Madeline Sheehan does not write hearts-and-flowers stories. But her biker romances are must-reads. While this wasn't as raw as 'Undeniable', it is still one of the best examples of this genre. I can't wait for more books from Ms. Sheehan. She is one of my auto-buy authors.

 Alice Clayton writes funny. sexy, adult romantic comedies. There's plenty of steam and always just the right amount of emotional tension to deliver a good, light, satisfying read. 
 Mai Tai'd Up is the story of Chloe and Lucas. This is a standalone and although Chloe was mentioned in Screwdrivered, you do not need to read the previous books! You can dive right in, and you will enjoy the story. 
 Chloe is a ""runaway bride"" and realizes that she was not in love with her fiancee. Much to the horror of her very proper family, she picks up and moves away to begin a whole new chapter in her life. Her passion is reuse animals and she opens a rescue center for pit bulls. And that brings her to the handsome veterinarian in town, Lucas. 
 The two begin a flirtation and and Chloe really begins to fall for Lucas. I mean, who wouldn't? A sexy vet? Hello! I loved their scenes together, and their relationship was a slow-build. There is one thing that Lucas can't stand, and when he finds out about Chloe's almost-trip to the altar, things blow up. 
 I absolutely loved how independent and feisty Chloe was. She is no wallflower! She's smart and no pushover. Often heroines can be kind of a door mat but not Chloe. And there are plenty of really funny moments in this book to go along with the swoon-y romance. Overall I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a fresh, fun and breezy read. Alice Clayton really knows how to deliver a well-written, well-paced story. Oh, and this is a great book for dog lovers!

 Brilliant!! It took me a while to gather my thoughts on this story. I don't even know what to say about this book other than it was fan-freaking-tastic. Beth Flynn is a master storyteller. Let me stop right here and say that if you have not read Nine Minutes, you must must must read that book before starting this one. OUT OF TIME is filled with spoilers as well as a huge cast of characters that will have your head spinning if you have not yet read the first book. 
 The events that occur in OOT are absolutely mind-boggling. Cathy and I both thought we knew where this story would go, but believe me, even in our wildest imaginations, we never could have guessed the twists and turns that occurred in this book. 
 We are both huge Grizz fans. I loved him even more after reading the flashback scenes and learning about this childhood (such as it was.) His devotion/obsession with Ginny was more fully explained and the use of flashbacks was perfection. 
 A word about that: Cathy is a tough reader, almost impossible to please, and she LOVED this book! She actually called it ""perfect""! And that word sums up Beth Flynn's storytelling ability. Every character in Out of Time is essential, there are no throwaway scenes, and absolutely no unnecessary drama. Make no mistake, this book is violent, it is gritty but it is unbelievable gripping, intense and sexy. 
 My heart broke several times over while reading this story. And while I am a GFFL (Grizz Fan for Life!), Beth Flynn did an amazing job with Grunt's character. His love for Ginny is endless. This is the kind of book that must be savored, re--read and discussed. There is that much going on. And the world of MC's is not in any way sugar-coated yet the story is immensely readable and unforgettable. 
 At the core of this series is the love Grizz has for Ginny. It is unending. 
 OUT OF TIME is without question one of the best books we have read this year. This series is a must-read. Don't miss out.

Her books are among my all-time favorites and The King was an absolute delight to read, from beginning to end. I have always loved Kingsley Edge so I couldn't wait to read an entire book about him! And once again, the author completely captivated and enthralled me. 
 ""He thought of nothing, remembered nothing, but felt everything."" 
 This book mainly tells the story of Kingsley's relationship with Soren but there are plenty of other characters making an appearance in this book. Of course, I am addicted to Kingsley and Soren so their scenes together are completely mind-blowing and absolutely satisfying. This is a very adult and sophisticated book, the prose is gorgeous and the dialogue is pure genius. 
 Even though I though I know Kingsley's story, the author provides plenty of delicious surprises along the way. I LOVED this book!!! It's sexy, funny, incredibly dramatic and gut-wrenching and completely amazing. I did miss Nora, she is not really the focus of The King but she plays a pivotal role nonetheless. The focus here is on Kingsley and his story. I adored the author's snappy banter, smart storyline and very topical themes. 
 ""What's your poison?"" the bartender asked, and Kinglsey answered, ""Blonds."" 
 The King is a must-read!! You will lose yourself in this book. I miss Kingsley already!

 Maybe Not is the funny, sexy and un-put-downable story of Warren and Bridgette and their sometimes rocky and always passionate road from enemies to lovers. This is a novella spin-off of MAYBE SOMEDAY and must, must, must be read after MAYBE SOMEDAY, which by the way is one of my all-time favorites and is not to be missed. There is a major spoiler in this story that will take away a bit from your enjoyment of Maybe Someday if you are a first-time reader. 
 Once again, Colleen delivers a fresh, perfectly-written, intense and witty storyline that kept me reading well into the night. Warren can't stand his new roommate Bridgette at first, but their constant bickering, fighting and pranking quickly turns into something more: 
 ""Oh, my God. I'm obsessed. 
 I'm like a stalker. 
 I am a stalker."" 
 ""She's so confusing, She's so frustrating. She's so damn unpredictable. 
 She's nothing I've ever wanted in a girl. And absolutely everything I need."" 
 I'm kinda obsessed with Colleen's characters and Maybe Not is no excerption. The dialogue and the story are flawless and remind me once again why I will read anything this woman writes. Oh, and there's also plenty of steam in this one to please every romance reader.

Of course, Leah Raeder has a gift with words, that was evident from Unteachable and Black Iris. But Cam Girl took so many twists and turns that my head (and my heart) were left reeling. 
 A book about love, acceptance, sexuality and I think also friendship and loyalty, Cam Girl is one of my favorite books of the year. There is a rawness to Ms. Raeder's writing that is addictive and very real and very challenging. Vada and Ellis kept me constantly guessing, constantly on edge and ultimately, left me with a much deeper understanding of the human condition. 
 Vada is an artist who has become unable to draw like she had in the past. She is forced to drop out of grad school. But she never stops thinking like an artist and seeing the world through a artist's eyes. 
 ""Art is an imperfect impression of the world. As the self is an imperfect impression of the soul."" 
 This story is about losing love, finding love and learning to love yourself. I highlighted so many parts of this book, that I can't possibly pick out my favorite quotes! Vada and Ellis' journey was suspenseful, sexy and breathtaking, and I'm not revealing more of the plot other than to say read the blurb, and then dive right into this fabulous, sexy and beautifully written book. Ms. Raeder's prose is lyrical and her words come alive on the page. 
 ""My love is savage and rapacious. It isn't content to the touch. It wants to be inside, crawl into the marrow, caress each vein until the cells are all mixed up and there is no you and me anymore, no secrets or shadows sliding between our skin."" 
 Be prepared to be challenged. Cam Girl is not your everyday story. It is filled with unforgettable characters and a story I won't soon forget.

 Tessa and Luke. They absolutely can't stand each other...but really they are perfect for each other! All I Want is the second book in the Alabama Summer series and can be read as a standalone although it is recommended that you read Book #1 first. I have not read the first book and I still loved this second installment in the series. The sex is HOT, the attraction undeniable and the story fast-apced and gripping! Tessa and Luke are two incredibly stubborn people who just can't seem to stop torturing each other. Tessa broke up with Luke for what she thought was good reason (if a little misguided) and while he can't forgive her, he also can't seem to stay away from her, either. 
 I'm a sucker for a hot Alpha in a uniform and Luke is one protective, sexy cop. He has a very, very painful family life, one that he hides from Tessa, much to her dismay. Despite her initial resentment of Luke, and jealousy over his random hook-ups, she really wants to be there for him emotionally. 
 Much of this book is spent with these two fighting and then having scorching hot sex. J. Daniels can really write a super-hot, sexy and fast-paced read that will keep you very entertained. This book is as lighthearted as some of her other books but it is very enjoyable and I recommend it for fans of second-chance romance and super-hot, sexy, Southern Alphas who won't take no for an answer! And not to fear, these two have a HEA, even after all of their emotional ups and downs. And I can't wait for the next book in this series, Reed!

 Pepper Winters has created yet another richly woven story in Final Debt, along with even more backstory and fantastic insight into the series' characters. It is difficult for me to adequately describe my feelings about this book and the characters, first because I've read early copies of almost every one of them and second because Jethro and Nila are two of my favorite main characters. It is hard to say the word ""hero"" in the same sentence as Jethro because of the dark nature of this series, but trust me, he truly becomes the man he is meant to be in Final Debt. And the Epilogue? Pure gold. 
 I was completely and utterly satisfied with the way the author concluded this series. My emotions were all over the place while reading this last book and the Epilogue. At times I was fearful that the worst would happen, and at other times I was hoping against hope that Nila and Jethro would overcome all of the dark forces that conspired against them. To say this book is an emotional roller coaster is an understatement. The historical-romance-themed tone of this series again shines through in this book and I am THRILLED at the announcement of a related book about William Hawk! The only thing that would make me happier is if these books were made into a movie or television series. 
 Expect LOTS of surprises in this incredibly satisfying conclusion to the Indebted Series. My heart is breaking a little at saying goodbye to Jethro and Nila.",Sun Nov 23 16:28:49 -0800 2014,Mon Nov 30 00:13:18 -0800 2015,Wed Nov 18 00:00:00 -0800 2015,Mon Nov 16 00:00:00 -0800 2015,17,1

Affliction was a but of a surprise, having a much more emotional story than the first book in the series. This book can absolutely be read as a standalone, although the characters are first introduced in Book One and some of the plot might be a little spoiler-ish. 
 Sy is angry, gruff, and hard-edged, having suffered a very, very painful loss several years before. He spends the first part of the book acting like a complete jerk towards our heroine Holly, and at times I almost felt like the author was making him into a lost cause. Holly is spirited and outgoing and we first meet her in Book One. She meets Sy when her best friend becomes involved with the Club President. 
 Holly, too, has spiraled into a very dark place and Sy is drawn to her and knows that he can help her overcome her emotional scars. I grew to love Sy while reading this book and absolutely adored the protective way he treated Holly. While this story might seem like it is dark and very emotional, the sex scenes are off the charts hot and very, very steamy. And, there is actually a beautiful love story here and a lovely message about forgiveness, acceptance and letting go of the past. All in all, this is a great story for all fans of MC romance. I can't wait to read more from this author!

 Delicious!!! DARK WILD NIGHT is a very sexy, very readable, fast-paced story about two friends who want to move out of the dreaded friend zone. I had forgotten how incredibly HOT and sexy Christina Lauren's stories can be!! OLIVER!! 
 Christina Lauren's stories are a book-crack addiction that I don't intend to give up! I didn't think I could love a couple any more than the other couples in this series but I was wrong. Oliver is sexy, sweet, romantic, and totally sensual and loving on top of it all!! No asshole-y-ness here, just a sexy-sweet, feel-good romance. 
 I absolutely fell in love with Lola, she's a total geek and totally adorable. These two are the only ones of their group of friends who didn't stay married after the shenanigans in Las Vegas. But they are close friends who don't want to ruin a good thing by becoming involved romantically. Even though I knew what was ultimately in store for these two, it still didn't put a damper on my enjoyment of this lushly-written yet totally modern story. 
 Oliver and Lola are two of the most ""real"" characters to date in this series. Lola is consumed with her work and Oliver backs off when she needs space. There is no unnecessary drama here, just two people who care deeply for each other, have smoking-hot chemistry but who have insecurities just like the rest of us. 
 ""I don't think I've ever loved anyone quite like this. In this sort of giddy, obliterating game-changing way. Where I can see myself with her for the rest of my life..."" 
 I feel in love with Oliver and can't wait for more yumminess from this awesome writing duo.

 TIGHT is another unexpected, gripping, very sexy story from Alessandra Torre. It is best that you don't read much about this book before going in, so that you can read it with a fresh eye. The plot is nothing that I expected and delivered a thrilling, one-two punch that came out of left field! 
 On its surface, the story is a contemporary erotic romance between Riley and Brett. They meet while she is attending a bachelorette party and like most books by Ms. Torre, there are other factors at play here that are lurking just below the surface. The chemistry between the two is undeniable, the sexy times are off the charts, and the action is heart-stopping and fast-paced. This is not a light-hearted book, it takes very dark turns but if you stick with this book you will be rewarded with a very satisfying ending. 
 Riley is a very strong heroine and Brett is unforgettable. And talk about the steam factor! SWOON! Tight is a fairly quick read, mostly because you won't be able to put it down.

 Pam Godwin is at the top of my list of favorite authors. Her dark and thrilling stories are among my most treasured books so I was absolutely thrilled to read a copy of Dirty Ties. I loved the crime/thriller/revenge twists in this story. As with all of Ms. Godwin's books, the characters are engaging, the story is twisted, and the steam factor is completely off the charts. 
 Kaci is highly educated, hard working and a loyal wife to Collin. Their unconventional marriage has led to a lonely life for Kaci and she is desperately seeking the intimacy that is missing from with her husband. Her fascination with the underground racing circuit in Chicago leads her to the mysterious ""Evader"", a man who has plenty of secrets himself. These two become enmeshed in a dangerous game that will certainly leave one the of them broken. 
 I love how Ms. Godwin always writes very strong heroines who aren't afraid to go after what they want. Her women are determined, smart and driven, and Kaci is no different. She might have met her match with a sexy man she meets one night, and these two together were absolute magic! 
 ""She was a wild card, and that fucking terrified me."" 
 Lightening up this dark and sexy story are some humorous moments which were a welcome relief from the intense storyline. I especially loved Kaci and Collin's interactions and Kaci's internal debates, especially when it came to the hot new guy she meets: 
 ""What about me?"" The possessive hand on my thigh clenched. ""Are you interested?"" 
 Oh, let me count the ways. And each one led to heartbreak.""

 I read The Hurricane in one sitting and was completely surprised by this fantastic debut book!! This story went way beyond my expectations and I absolutely fell in love with Cormac O'Connell. This book is not a standard fighter romance, but instead takes its time developing the characters, their relationships and the secondary characters in this story. I loved it all! And I especially loved the British flavor to this book. 
 While this book has PLENTY of steam and sexy times, Emily and Cormac's relationship is not just based on sex - they start off slowly as friends, because she is literally scared of her own shadow and frightened of a relationship with a man. Emily McCarthy is sweet, quite, smart and anti-social. It takes Cormac, to me a gentle giant, to slowly bring her out of her shell. 
 ""Safe is boring."" 
 Emily is hard-working and paying her own way through University. She doesn't want to fall for Cormac but he takes things gradually, and vows to protect her no matter what. Eventually she learns to trust him and to let herself actually feel something for another person. 
 ""He was the loud to my quiet, the confidence to my shyness, the rage to my pain. Separately, we were broken and alone. Together, we were blissfully happy and complete and every time that we made love was a celebration."" 
 There is plenty of tension in this fast-paced story and I adored the secondary characters as well. The Hurricane is a stellar debut novel and I cannot wait to read more from this author!!

 How I love the writing duo of K.A. Merikan. I will read anything that these two write. And Tooth, OMG, I know he's gay, but I think he might be my new book boyfriend!! He's bearded, huge, tough and unexpectedly tender with Lucifer. But don't even ask where he got the nickname of Tooth! 
 Although this is the second book in a series, the books can be read as standalones. In The Devil's Ride, Tooth is ordered to protect the Club President's son and at first, it is a painful, unwanted chore. Luci is a brat and very out of the closet, very different than Tooth. But he is crazy about Tooth, even if a little scared of him, and even acts out so that Tooth will ""punish"" him. Although I absolutely adored the smexy times between these two, and they are SCORCHING HOT, I also loved the gritty and very violent look inside MC life. This is not a sugar-coated story at all. I loved the underlying story about a crime the MC is trying to solve. (Not for the faint of heart!) 
 I absolutely adored the slow-burn of Tooth and Luci's relationship. It made their love scenes together all the sweeter. And did I mention that K.A. Merikan can write some of the most erotic sex scenes out there? You will need a cold shower after reading The Devil's Ride!!

 I enjoyed this hockey book a lot and recommend it for anyone who likes a good, hot sports story with a lot of heart. Alex is an incredibly gifted hockey player who comes from an abusive background which is now affecting his game and his relationship with his teammates. 
 As part of a penalty, he is required to volunteer at a local drug-abuse prevention program alongside the beautiful and selfless Sutton. She is different from the hockey groupies who throw themselves at him, but at first he is a total jerk to her. No matter. Sutton sees the wounded person inside and they begin to fall for each other, even as he tries to push her away emotionally. 
 ""I've been a prick far longer than I've been charming. You're seeing a new side to me, but you know the old is bound to come out."" 
 ""We all have days when our monsters come out, Alex. You're not going to scare me off if I see yours."" 
 Sutton is feisty and educated and sees through Alex's B.S. She, too, comes from a dysfunctional family but unlike Alex, she has a positive outlook and is very close to her family. Will she be able to bring out the best in Alex and help him overcome his past demons? This book has more layers than a typical sports romance story and the characters really grew on me. I loved the hockey scenes and the steam factor between these two is AMAZING. 
 I have one tiny issue with this story, and I have found that it is not just unique to this book. Why can't a heroine be on birth control because she doesn't want to get pregnant? Why does it have to be to regulate her periods? This did not affect my enjoyment of the book, I am just surprised to see this recur over and over again in books. Overall, I really like the author's writing style. Alex is a sweetly sexy story with a heroine who is no pushover. It is a quick, romantic read with a VERY satisfactory conclusion. I actually found myself tearing up near the end! I also LOVED the other team members and I know they will have some great stories, too.

A thrilling, fast-paced, GRIPPING and memorable story called Never Never. If you have ever read anything written by Colleen Hoover, you know you are getting rich characters, an unforgettable plot and just all around amazing stories. And Tarryn Fisher has an imagination that can't be rivaled! Ever read her The Love Me With Lies series? Amazing. And Never Never ranks right up there with these writers' best books. 
 From the first words of this book, I was left feeling like someone pulled the rug out from under me. This overall feeling of disorientation is vital to the story, and the authors pulled it off with great success. I sympathized with the characters, felt their confusion, and could not stop turning the pages! This isn't exactly a paranormal story, and I cannot wait to see where the story goes. This review is brief because this book is best read without knowing too much about the plot. It is highly imaginative, inventive and very, very different. Don't miss this one!!

 ""I'd discovered sex at a really young age, completely by happenstance, and like music, it had touched a nerve with me. I still craved that feeling, that closeness, and I sought it out as often as I could. I wasn't picky about who I slept with--older, younger, attractive, homely, mothers, girlfriends, wives. Who they were didn't matter to me, I only cared that they were interested. That probably wasn't the best thing to admit, but it was the truth. Sex was a release for me. It made me feel like a part of something bigger than myself, made me feel connected to the world around me. And I needed to feel that way. My life was full of empty spaces."" 
 And so begins this unexpectedly sexy and compelling book told from Kellan Kyle's POV. Forget that you think you know Kellan and Kiera's story, Thoughtful is a fresh and emotional story and is an absolute must-read!! 
 This book is a tribute to the fantastic talent that is S.C. Stephens. Kellan's voice is very male, very original and very, very sexy! My heart once again ached for him as we were given a peak inside his head and inside his heart. This story gives us insight into Kellan and Kiera's undeniable attraction, the heartache they both experienced and some amazing sexy times between the two of them. It is painful but compelling and I could not put this book down. 
 ""For a brief second, I wondered what she really thought about me. Did she know anything about me besides my name and that I was in a band? Did she realize I screamed my heart out in my lyrics? Did she understand that my life left me feeling vacant inside? That I was so fucking lonely I almost couldn't stand myself? Would she want to know any of that? Or was the fact that I was a ""rock star"" enough for her? Like it was for all the other girls I'd slept with."" 
 I absolutely loved the music scenes and they are an integral part of this book. I literally swooned all over again reading Thoughtful. 
 ""When it was time for us to go play, a familiar feeling washed over me--anxiousness mixed with peace. As I walked up the steps to the stage worn with use, I felt the remnants of who I was melting off me. Onstage, none of my worries touched me. It was like I was a different person. Like I was acting, and yet I was being more truthful than I ever was off the stage. I bled my heart out while I was performing, not that many people truly noticed; they were too busy enjoying the showmanship to dig beneath the surface of the words. There was safety in the scrutiny, anonymity in the spotlight. I felt invincible up there. Just me and my guitar."" 
 The loneliness, the pain of first love...it is all here and more. Thoughtful is a must-read and I applaud the author for giving us an amazingly fresh and new look at the irresistible Kellan Kyle.

 ""Then it's hardly lust.""

 ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!! TURBULENCE was perfectly DIRTY, funny and smart. I could not put it down. There are books that fulfill a certain reading mood, and this juicy story was just what I needed. I totally connected with Gillian and Jake, and more importantly, FELT their connection, too. 
 The chapter headings in this book are priceless and the story line was incredibly creative. Just when I thought the author was taking a predictable path, the plot veered off into unexpected territory. Our hero Jake is cold, distant and sarcastic, but boy can he fuck. He is a MACHINE. He has a woman waiting in every city. When our heroine Gillian meets him, they both agree to a strictly-sex arrangement. But of course you know that one of them is going to fall hard and get their heart broken. But it's what happens along the way that makes for a yummy, delicious, insanely addictive story. And oh my God, the sex in this book is burning hot. I mean this is totally NSFW, reading-under-the-covers kind of sex. 
 ""We'll always be fucking, Gillian"" He smiled, biting my lip before tossing me onto the bed. ""That's the best part of us."" 
 This book would have been 5 stars for me except for some minor details. It might seem clever to name characters after real authors, but to me, it cheapens the story. Many readers will recognize one of the main characters in this book but again, that detail lessened the impact of the story to me. Finally, proofreading would have helped to correct certain inconsistencies in the story. 
 BUT overall, I adored this book and completely devoured it!! I highly recommend TURBULENCE and can't wait for more from this author!

 I could read only Kristen Ashley books and be very happy. RIDE STEADY is another slam-dunk winner from the Queen of Alphas, with a story that ripped my heart out and characters that I won't soon forget. Joker might be one Ms. Ashley's most unforgettable Alphas ever, a man who rose from a painful and loveless childhood to become a patched-in Brother of the Chaos MC. Chaos became his family, and the MC recognized the fire burning in Joker that would serve the club well. 
 ""He was at the shop window, empty pockets, face pressed to the glass, starin' at what he wanted but couldn't have. I'll wager, to survive, he's banked that fire. We gotta help him direct it and make sure if it flares bright, it doesn't burn him out."" 
 Carissa Teodoro's life becomes entwined with Joker's, as the two former high school classmates meet again years later. Let me just say that this book is so incredibly gripping and heartbreaking and sexy, that I am tempted to re-read it to experience these feelings all over again! She was once the golden girl who had it all, and he was the boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Their story spans years and that is what I love about Ms. Ashley's writing: there is no Insta-love here, instead, our hero and heroine have a shared history that adds a depth and richness to this book. 
 ""Yeah, Carrie,"" he answered. ""It's you. It's always been you. It'll always be you. Fuckin' always."" 
 Joker is a sexy, bad-ass Alpha biker that has zero interest in relationships, or in real friendships for that matter, since he has a hard time opening up to anyone about his feelings or his past. That is what makes his relationship with Carrie so poignant: this is a man who is so closed off and afraid of emotional bonds that he has been alone (and lonely) most of his life. 
 Carrie draws his out just by being herself. She is going through a messy and painful divorce, has a baby, is struggling to make ends meet and has a ton of emotional baggage. She is not perfect but she is open to love and gives her heart unconditionally to Joker. 
 ""Rule,"" he stated instantaneously. 
 His strange word made me blink at the lockers. ""Sorry?"" 
 ""Rule. You can't be like that on the phone. You can only be like that when I can kiss you."" 
 I lifted a hand and pressed it to the cold steel of my locker, leaning into it because my knees suddenly wouldn't support me. 
 ""You hear me?"" he asked. ""Yes, Joker."" 
 OH. EM. GEE!! *SWOON* I can't say enough about Ride Steady. Plus some of my favorite bad-ass Alphas from Ms. Ashley's other books make appearances here! Dead. There is also a sneak peek at the next Chaos book at the end of Ride Steady and it sounds amazing. Joker and Carissa's story is beautiful, thrilling and passionate. Ride Steady is a must-read!

Although each book can be read as a standalone, the series is fantastic and you really get a sense of the strong camaraderie and history between the characters if you read the series. It is hard to say goodbye to these beloved characters but Harper Sloan does in in style with Locke. 
 Locke has a horrible relationship with his family as does Emmy, each in a different way. They both suffer terrible emotional (and physical) abuse. Locke has been convinced by his family that he is worthless, evil, bad, etc., so it is no wonder that he believes he has nothing to offer anyone, let alone Emmy. 
 Emmy has always loved Locke and when these two finally get together, it's the usual hot and fiery Corps-Security, bad-ass Alpha way! Locke won't let anyone or anything harm his Emmy and she helps him finally confront his own personal demons. 
 This is a fast-paced, really sexy and hot read. I love this series and fell in love with all the Corps Security men. Locke's family felt a little over the top to me, almost cartoonish in their behavior but other than that, I loved this book and highly recommend it.

Annika Martin is a new author to me and now I want to read all of her books, too! As with all of Skye's books, the hero Grayson (yes, he is a hero to me) is darkly sexy, dangerous, forbidden and completely overpowering. He knows his power and attraction and he uses it against those weaker than him. Unfortunately it is a survival skill he learned at a very young age. Abigail meets him in prison when she is picked to teach a writing course to the inmates. But very quickly she realizes that Grayson is dangerously attractive, untrustworthy and dishonest. Or is he? 
 This book literally kept be turning the pages until the middle of the night. There is no right and wrong in this book, only two extremely damaged and vulnerable people who quickly become the target of a massive manhunt. Prisoner takes one thrilling turn after another, and Abigail, who fought Grayson with all her might, slowly realizes that all is not as it seems. 
 I loved Abigail's bravery in the face of absolute and complete danger. At first it seems as though Grayson would just as soon kill her than f*** her. But as with all for Skye's books (and I will assume Annika's books as well), this intensely sexual man is struggling with his own inner demons. Grayson makes no apologies for his actions. But will he and Abby survive all of the forces out to destroy them. 
 I couldn't put this book down. The prose is perfect and the story thrilling, sexy and even tender and heartbreaking at times. It is told in alternating point-of-views which gives great insight into Grayson's motivations. I was devastated to see this story end and I can only hope that the authors intend to write more stories including Grayson's crew. I absolutely loved Prisoner.

 ""...the problem with books is that they end. They seduce you. They spread their legs to you and pull you inside. And you go deep and leave your possessions and your ties to the world at the door and you like it inside and you don't want for your possessions or your ties and then, the book evaporates."" 
 Every word, every line of this book is PERFECT. I have never been so creeped out, or laughed so hard. I'm obsessed with Joe Goldberg! 
 Joe is obsessed with Beck. But I mean, hack into her email, stalk her every move kind of obsessed. And he is sick. Very, very sick. But that doesn't stop Caroline Kepnes from making him one of the funniest, creepiest, saddest, meanest and kindest characters of all time. He just wants Beck to love him. And that is no easy feat. Beck is at once smart, self-involved, funny, cruel and naive, but Joe is very, very determined. 
 ""You are a woman and I am a man and we belong in the dark together and you smell good, pure. I like that."" 
 This is not a romance but it is without a doubt one of the most memorable books I have ever read. Just when you think Joe has sunk to a new low, he goes even lower. He is perverted and weird and I am obsessed with him!! This book is filled with absolutely unforgettable characters. And the jokes about New York City living are the best.

 ""He had the manners of a gentlemen all wrapped up in the cutthroat harshness of a criminal."" 
 Just...WOW!! I am a huge fan of Pepper Winters and RUIN & RULE is another dark, action-packed and twisted tale from this incredibly talented writer. 
 If you're a fan of MC books, then you add this one to your must-read list!! It has it all, a strong, beautiful and spirited heroine, a tortured, complicated hero, tons of action and lots and lots of complicated plot twists and turns. 
 PURE IN THOUGHTS AND VENGEANCE. CORRUPT IN ALL THINGS THAT MATTER, and the symbolism of what he stood for. Biker. 
 I was on pins and needles from the first page of this book. I experienced the disorientation of our heroine, Sarah/Cleo, as she woke to the horrific reality of being held captive by a vicious MC gang. She feels a glimmer of recognition when she sees Arthur ""Kill"" Killian, but from where? When? I kept turning the pages to find the answers. Does Kill know her? Why is he so ruthless? There are so many to this story! Sarah/Cleo has lost her memory and her only clues to her past are tiny flashes of memories that come to her fleetingly. She feels a connection to Kill, but why? 
 ""I'm no one. And no one would've helped me. In my world--you survive or you die. You don't rely on others to make sure you do either one. It's the very first fucking lesson you learn."" The pain in his voice notched around my heart, squeezing. 
 I loved the small glimpses from Kill's POV. This book is a fantastic bundle of delicious mysteries all wrapped up in a sexy, dangerous biker package. Despite his hardened demeanor, Kill slowly allows himself to feel something for our heroine, all the while knowing his feelings could be the end of him. 
 For the first time in my godforsaken life, I felt... felt something instead of the cold hatred of vengeance. It gave me strength all while making me weak. I wanted more. Therefore, I had to stop. Before she destroyed me--just like all the rest. 
 Pepper Winters made me feel sorry for Kill, despite his outwardly vicious demeanor. This was a man who had suffered terribly and been horribly mistreated. But by whom? Many answers are revealed but I am definitely craving more. 
 ""I'd been spoon-fed lies all my life. I'd become a master at smelling untruths. And the woman currently residing in my home--the woman who'd healed me -- smelled terrifyingly toxic. A scent that made me want to run with one heartbeat and then fuck her with the next. She made me face things I was no longer strong enough to face. She made me look past her scam and crave."" 
 RUIN & RULE is told through a series of flashbacks interwoven with the present-day story. Pepper Winters is the mistress of a gripping and intense story and this one is no exception. Just when I though I knew what the outcome would be, she proved me wrong. RUIN & RULE is also a STUNNINGLY beautiful love story and succeeds as a romance on every level. There is a twist at the end and I cannot wait to get the next chapter in Kill and Cleo's story!!

This story is not for the faint of heart so heed the warnings, but if you are ready for a stunning, thrilling, twisted and emotional story, then Debt is for you. 
 A suspenseful and revenge-filled tale, Debt had me on the edge of my seat from the first page. I highlighted so much of this book that I could fill this review with amazing passages but read it for yourself and experience this fantastic and sexy story. I have never read a book by Nina Jones and she absolutely blew me away by this story. 
 ""This man is my stalker, my terrorizer, my lover."" 
 Told in flashbacks and in alternating POV's, Debt is a story about Tax Draconi, who has come to settle an old debt from Mia Tibbett. He at first appears to be filled with hate, revenge and basically, with pure evil. His actions throughout much of the book are absolutely unforgivable. But the author is an absolute genius at making me actually love Tax and empathize with him. The scenes with Mia are beyond explicit. Tax brings new meaning to the phrase ""dirty talker"". 
 ""It's what I do when it comes to women. I can't give them affection, or love, or intimacy. That all died in me long ago. So I give what I can: Relief. Pleasure. Abandon."" 
 The focus of his plan is Mia, who remains mostly clueless about why Tax hates her so much, but still finds herself powerless under his erotic spell. He owns her, body and soul. She realizes that he has ruined her for other men and despite his evil ways, she still feels compelled to try to break through his wicked exterior. 
 ""Is it possible Tax could be everything I need in a man? He has the fire that burns me and awakens me. That was the thing I had been looking for, and it is so uniquely hard to find."" 
 The trauma that Tax and his twin sister Jude suffered at a young age is hinted at throughout the story and when finally revealed, sheds light on his behavior and Jude's thirst for revenge against Mia as well. This book might shock you but the story flows and the characters are unforgettable. I found a few minor inconsistencies with the story which in no way took away from my enjoyment of this dark, sexy. erotic, dark and fantastic story. I was distraught that Debt ended and I am waiting not-so-patiently for more from Ms. Nina G. Jones!

 I loved this book because it mixes both love and heartbreak seamlessly. I was so wrapped up in Cassie and Ethan's grand love story that I was thrown completely off-balance (just like Cassie!) when things would go wrong. And I loved every single minute of it!! The author once again switched between both past and present here, and while the back-and-forth can be jarring in some books, it worked perfectly here. 
 Broken Juliet picks up literally right where Bad Romeo ended. Ethan has broken Cassie's heart more than once and he is begging her for another chance. Cassie has finally moved on with her life and cannot believe that Ethan has finally changed and is open to really love her. One of the many, many things that I loved about this book is that it mixes in plenty of humor with the heartbreak and passion. Cassie is tentatively letting Ethan back into her life but she is trying her best to move slowly so her heart doesn't get trampled once again. Her inner monologue can be hilarious: 
 ""I can't drive. Is it cool for me to sleep on the couch?"" 
 No. Get out before I mount you. 
 Broken Juliet is a heart-pounding, passionate love story above all else. Leisa's writing is flawless and the chemistry between her two main characters absolutely off the charts. I was so connected with Ethan and Cassie that I was on the edge of my seat reading this book. And when Ethan gives Cassie his journals to read? Perfection. Cassie finally understands what was going on inside Ethan's head when he left her in drama school years before. These two share a passion and a love that is undeniable and absolutely breathtaking: 
 ""This man represents so many things to me. He was my first true friend. My first love. First lover. The master of more pleasure than I knew existed, and the architect of more heartache than I thought I could endure."" 
 I also really loved the behind-the-scenes look into the world of theatre. I appreciated the author's insights into the world of stage actors and the acting process. Some of my favorite scenes take place when Ethan and Cassie are in drama school, these are soul-baring, painful and beautiful passages to read. I can't recommend this series highly enough and I am totally addicted to Ethan Holt!! Both books are out now, so get reading! 
 4.5 passionate and heart-pounding stars!! 
 Favorite quotes: 
 The thing about developing an addiction is that it happens so quietly, you don't know how much trouble you're in until it's too late. It tiptoes through the rooms of your mind and body, gently inserting hooks and strings into every cell, until you don't know where you end and it begins. And untangling that web is nearly impossible. 
 This is more than lust. It's even more than love. It's imperative. Mindless, bloody-minded need. I can't kiss him deep enough, or hold him close enough.

 Well. Where do I begin? Bad Romeo is one of my favorite books of the year. It is the perfect blend of coming-of-age, intense longing, heartache, friendship and first love. The story is told in a mix of present-day and flashbacks which can be confusing but work perfectly here. Ethan Holt is the classic bad-boy, who smashed Cassie Taylor's heart when they were drama students. Flash-forward to present day, when they are both cast as the leads in a Broadway play. Told from Cassie's point of view, the book follows their completely tortured, angst-filled relationship. But don't be scared away: this book is raunchy, laugh-out-loud funny and will keep you turning the pages to see what will happen next. 
 Can Cassie work with Ethan again after what he did to her in the past? She can't seem to stay away from him and Leisa Rayven gives a wonderful, slow-build story that kept me reading until the wee hours of the night. I was fascinated by the behind-the-scenes look at the theatre world and the sometimes-painful description of the acting process. And even though this is a New Adult novel, it is incredibly sexy and steamy and filled with just the right blend of longing and sexual release. And Cassie, what a fantastic heroine! She's smart, tough-on-the-outside but very vulnerable, and funny as hell. I fell in love with Ethan Holt and even though he was portrayed as a jerk, felt sympathetic towards him because of his tortured past. I can't say enough about this book!! 
 After I finished this book, I was fascinated to read that it originally began as fan fiction. How did I not know this? I am now officially addicted to this series and this author. I highlighted practically the entire book. The ending was perfection and I am literally counting the days until the next book, Broken Juliet!!

 Looking for a different kind of story, but one with scorching hot sex scenes and a strong heroine? Read Uncivilized now! I was completely unprepared to fall in love with Zach but I did and I miss him already. There are some books that merely recite one sex scene after another, with no emotional connection between the characters and writing that fails to connect the reader with the characters. Well, not Uncivilized. Ms. Bennett has written a sensitive, interesting, very different story with absolutely memorable characters that will stay with me for a long time. 
 Zach at first comes across as a somewhat cold, savage man who will never become acclimated to the modern world. But is that such a bad thing? As the story progresses, Moira becomes more willing to bend towards Zach's way of life and his belief system. And this man is HOT HOT HOT. The book's sex scenes are absolutely among the most gorgeous, lush and loving scenes I have ever read. 
 This book could have been a cliche but it's most definitely not. I loved the world created by Ms. Bennett and I highly recommend Uncivilized. Enjoy! And have a freezer nearby!

 Dark. Dark. Dark. Those were my first thoughts upon finishing Raze. I love a good dark and gritty romance and Raze fits the bill. This book is filled with intense drama and brutal scenes of torture so be warned. I have a very strong threshold for dark reads, but there was an extra element that didn't quite sit well with me. That being said, this book has an incredibly creative storyline and some hot, steamy, passionate and over-the-top sex scenes that are alone worth reading the book for. 
 This story is told in flashbacks. Raze was brutally ripped from his home as a teenager and subjected to all kinds of physical and mental abuse at the hands of an underground fighting ring. He loses his memories of his family and his childhood and literally turns into a fighting machine, bent on revenge against the monster who put him away. These scenes in the underground are difficult, tough and gritty. 
 Raze has the vaguest memories of a girl who is Kisa, the daughter of a New York Russsian mobster. She, too, is condemned to a live of confinement as the fiancee of Alik, a sadisitic, brutal and controlling fighter. The stage is set for her past and her present to collide. Will she able to save Raze from almost-certain death? Will Raze ever remember Kisa, the only girl he ever loved? 
 ""I've seen too many bad things with these eyes. This, I will feel in my heart."" 
 There are scenes of incredible beauty in this book along with scenes so brutal they are difficult to get through. But all in all, this story kept me turning the pages to see where these characters' journeys would take them. I was cheering for Kisa to stand up to Alik and rooting for Raze to be able to find the peace he so desperately needed. If you like gritty fighter stories, then Raze is the book for you!",Mon Sep 22 15:56:26 -0700 2014,Fri Jan 02 07:33:43 -0800 2015,Mon Dec 29 00:00:00 -0800 2014,Sun Dec 28 00:00:00 -0800 2014,6,0

Filled with THE most amazing plot twists and gorgeous moments, November 9 literally took my breath away, This book is on my favorites lists, not just of 2015 but of all time. It is absolutely unforgettable!! 
 I read this book in one sitting and was absolutely devastated when it ended!! The writing is so perfect, the story is so creative and the characters are so vivid that I felt like a piece of me was missing was I finished this book. I felt like I knew Ben and Fallon personally, that's how expressive Colleen Hoover's writing is. 
 Fallon is damaged goods, growing up in Hollywood and having survived both emotional and physical trauma when she and Ben meet. 
 ""One of the things I always try to remind myself is that everyone has scars,"" she says. ""A lot of them even worse than mine. The only difference is that mine are visible and most people's aren't."" 
 Fallon and Ben are only teenagers when they first meet, literally on the eve of her big move to New York City. Could what Fallon feels for Ben be real and lasting? Only time will tell, as they make a pact to meet only once a year until she turns 23. No contact, no social media stalking, nothing, until their annual ""dates"". Fallon believes that this is the only way for her to be mature enough and self-reliant enough to be in a relationship with Ben. She is determined not to lose herself in a man. 
 But oh so much can happen in the time in between, and as the story unfolds from the past to the present, I began to realize what this book was really about. My heart broke for both Fallon and for Ben, and I was completely taken aback by the path this story took. 
 There are SO many memorable moments in this book, and they all took my breath away. Imagine think you have met your soul mate, only to see them once a year for the next few years! I wanted to scream at Fallon and Ben to grab onto their love and never let it go. 
 ""Please say yes. Please tell me you aren't finished falling in love with me yet.""

 The minute I saw Aleks Voinov's name in the acknowledgements, I knew I would LOVE this book, and I was right! His epic work Special Forces is one of my favorite books. Please heed the author warnings about Guns N' Boys, this is a dirrrrrrrty, homoerotic, violent crime thriller. But wow, what a ride! This book grabbed me from the first page an did not let go. 
 Seth is the son of a crime lord and is rescued and secreted home by the irresistibly sexy, dangerous and dominant Domenico. The two were childhood friends but hadn't seen or spoken to each other in years. 
 ""Domenico was the human equivalent of his motorbike. Fast and dangerous, yet impossible to resist taking a ride on, even at the risk of getting hurt."" 
 This book is a fast-paced, super-sexy, graphic and very intense story of two men in a forbidden relationship. Seth and Dom could not be more different, but yet find themselves drawn to each other. They must hide their relationship, and the underlying tension between these two had me on the edge of my seat. 
 There is a fantastic surprise for fans of the Dark Souls series!! Even if you haven't read the series, you will love the character of Sylvio. Guns N' Boys is a super-hot, incredibly well-written, steamy thriller. If you want to move outside your comfort zone and you love M/M books, then I highly recommend Guns n' Boys. There will be more books in this series and I absolutely cannot wait for the next installment!

 WHOA!! Ricochet was un-putdownable!! Very, very dark, violent and sexy. Loved the fast-paced story. Great book for dark romance fans. 
 Told in dual POV's, Ricochet pulled me in from the first page and was one of those books that I could not put down. The storyline is very fresh, very original and very, very violent and dark. Which I totally loved. 
 Nick is hell-bent on the revenge of his family's violent death and Aubree is a pawn in his scheme. But she is trapped in a hellish world of her own, in a marriage to a sadistic, powerful man from whom she is all to relieved to escape. 
 Even before Nick abducts her, Aubree is fascinated with a mysterious masked man who warns Detroit's ruling elite that the city's criminal element is coming down: 
 ""I'd become obsessed with him just the same. Behind that mask was a mastermind of the most notorious computer hacks the city had ever known. His bold threats, his willingness to take on my psychopathic husband, had turned him into my own personal fantasy. 
 Is Nick the same, myserious dark avenger? Ricochet is not your average dark-romance kidnap story. Nick is cruel to Aubree but she slowly becomes obsessed with him, and he with her. Even though she started out as just a faceless pawn in his game. 
 ""I'd fallen in lust with a complete stranger, strictly on the basis that he happened to scare the shit out of my husband. 
 Aubree sees the hurt and pain behind Nick's rage and he slowly realizes that Aubree has suffered as well: 
 ""I saw darkness in her beauty, and she saw beauty in my darkness. Yin and yang. Black and white. Beauty and scars; fury and forgiveness. She should've been my nemesis, but in her, I found something I didn't know I was looking for."" 
 The law of the streets rule in this book and the action is gritty and unrelenting. And there is a HUGE twist at the end that I did not see coming. Ricochet is a great fast-paced, emotional, gritty and VERY sexy read that I highly recommend.",Mon Sep 01 08:36:25 -0700 2014,Tue Dec 01 10:35:27 -0800 2015,Wed Jul 29 00:00:00 -0700 2015,Mon Jul 20 00:00:00 -0700 2015,13,2

 Cathy and I read this book together which has become a rarity lately! We both loved this book and found it to be a beautifully written, heartfelt story filled with amazing and memorable characters. And Gus, hello!! What an amazing guy!! Perfect. He's loyal, sexy, honest, hard-working and always there for Kate. 
 This book tackles some very sensitive subjects so this will be a completely spoiler-free review. Kate is very funny, tough on the outside, and gives a lesson in what's important in life to just about everyone she meets. Cathy is not a huge fan of mature young adult novels and even she loved this one! 
 ""Katie didn't just look on the bright side, she lived there."" 
 And let's not forget Keller. We loved Kate with Keller! Once their slow-build relationship picked up steam, they were irresistible together. The alternating POV's told in the form of diary entries worked great in this book and really gave great insight into each of the character's state of mind. Keller grew emotionally and matured over the course of the story which was a beautiful thing to see. 
 ""Just when you think you know someone, they change. Or you change. Or maybe you both change. And that changes everything."" 
 I loved the book and would have really adored more steamy scenes between Keller and Kate. Cathy would have liked a little deeper exploration into the music scene. But we both loved Bright Side and think that Ms. Holden is an amazingly talented writer. 
 There are many secrets in this book and you will really enjoy it much more if you don't know what they are. This book will make you laugh, cry and and get lost in the story. Don't miss this one. And we are doing a happy dance because it looks like Gus will be getting his own story next year! SQUEEE!!

 Sexy and totally addictive. Sustained is written in the unique Emma Chase style that I love! Ms. Chase ""returns to her roots"" in this super-sexy and funny story with lots of heart. 
 Ms. Chase really nails the male POV in SUSTAINED and she had me literally laughing out loud at Jake's inner monologue. He's a player, never letting his one-night stands stay past their first cup of morning coffee, and acting quite happy about the way his life is arranged. 
 ""If you're my date, stick to what will turn you on. I'm not a therapist or Prince Charming - and I don't pretend to be."" 
 Until Chelsea and her brood of six come crashing into his well-structured life, Jake never dreamed he'd be remotely interested in a relationship, let alone a ready-made family of six. Now I am not usually a fan of kids in my romance books. I have two big ones and let's just say I prefer a little escapism in my reading. But Ms. Chase makes the kids here such an integral part of the story that they were a delight to experience. There's no ridiculous babble or baby-talk but there are some tough scenes about raising teens, bullying and even just trying to find a moment alone with your significant other in the middle of chaos. 
 But SUSTAINED is at its best when Jake does the talking (or thinking!). Before he meets Chelsea, really all he wants is a warm body and some meaningless sex. A brief dry spell at the beginning of the story led to some of my favorite quotes: 
 ""...You and Hanna are going to be monogamous for a while."" 
 My eyes squint, 'cause I have no idea what he's saying. 
 ""Hanna who?"" 
 He waves his palm. ""Hanna Hand."" 
 Emma Chase writes some of best male POV's I have ever read. I absolutely loved how Jake evolved in this book from a callous playboy to a guy who realizes what's important in life. This book is expertly written, with a beautiful story, tons of steam and witty, fast-paced dialogue. Highly recommended!! 
 Favorite quote: 
 She frowns back. ""And you sound like you don't respect philosophy very much."" 
 ""All philosophical questions can be answered with one concise statement."" 
 Chelsea refills her glass. ""Which is?"" 
 ""'Who gives a fuck?'"" 
 She laughs, and it's an amazing sound.

 That's what scars are for. They protect the wounds. Cover them with thick, numb tissue so we'll never have to fell that same pain again. The bottom of my stump is one big, hard callus"" 
 I absolutely adore Emma Chase! She is back with another super-sexy, witty and warm-hearted story that made me laugh at loud and tear up a bit. 
 Brent and Kennedy's story is sexy, funny, and completely endearing. Brent won me over and once again, Ms. Chase shows her skills at writing the male POV. 
 Brent Mason is a top lawyer and is totally surprised to see Kennedy Randolph again after many years. She was a sweet and nerdy girl who has now blossomed into a beautiful swan, who is also gorgeous, smart and his adversary in the courtroom. 
 Irresistible Brent sleeps around (a LOT) but never forgot his first love. Kennedy and Brent now face off in court in a high-profile case which added lots of opportunities for these two to really let the sparks fly. But it's the supporting cast of characters as well as the witty banter between these two that are central to this story. An interesting twist to the story is that Brent lost his leg in a childhood accident. He doesn't let this slow him down in ANY area of his life. This was a refreshing change of pace in an otherwise funny and sexy contemporary romance story. 
 Kennedy is scared of getting involved with Brent after all these years and the flashbacks to her teenage years, when she was bullied at school, are very poignant and form a stark contrast to the smart, successful attorney she is now. But Brent will stop at nothing to show Kennedy that she is the love of his life, and he is one determined guy! 
 ""...I collapse on top of her, my bones turned to Jell-o. 
 When the aftershocks eventually ebb, she laughs. That tinkling, magical laugh that sings of contentment and tugs up my own lips in a responding smile. 
 Now that - that is how you start a f-cking trial."" 
 Emma Chase's fans will eat this one up! Ms. Chase keeps up her winning streak with Appealed, a great entry in the Legal Briefs series. 
 ""Commitment isn't always a burden, Brent. It can also be the source of unimaginable joy and satisfaction.""

A few inconsistencies in the timeline interfered with my enjoyment of the book and I found some of characters to be Southern stereotypes. I also didn't really feel the emotional connection between Stanton and Sofia. I absolutely adore this talented author and will always read her books!

 Magnificent and heart-stopping. This was my first reaction upon finishing Finding Eden, the continuation of Calder and Eden's story from Becoming Calder. Mia Sheridan has become one of my go-to favorite authors for creative story lines, heart-stopping emotion, and beautiful, glorious, sexy and REAL love scenes. 
 This will be a short review because both books should be read together and contain so many twists and turns, they are best read without knowing too much detail. Just know that the author answers all questions left open at the end of Becoming Calder, and delivers an incredibly satisfying conclusion for these two amazing characters. 
 Calder and Eden take an incredible journey and Ms. Sheridan lets you experience every heart-stopping second of it. Both books taken together are about staying strong, staying true to yourself even when everyone around you tells you something different, and overcoming incredible obstacles to find your one true love. 
 This isn't all hearts and flowers; there are some really steamy sex scenes along with some very brutal scenes of psychological and physical abuse. But the author really knows how to bring an epic love story to a wonderful conclusion and Finding Eden does all of that and more. 
 ""And we'll spend as much time as we need just escaping from the world. That's our plan because I swear to you, my beautiful, sweet love, everyone deserves a love story that doesn't hurt."" 
 In the end, Finding Eden is a story about forgiveness and learning to love yourself no matter what has happened to you in the past. Run, don't walk, to pick up a copy of both Becoming Calder and Finding Eden. Your life will be all the better for having read these books. 
 Favorite Quote (well, one of many!): 
 ""We have to figure out how to forgive, not for the people who wronged us, but for us. We can't keep bitterness attached to our hearts because eventually, it might become part of us--so deeply ingrained we can't work it back out. I think we have to focus on the beauty we've been given in this life, and make that the thing that defines us.""

 Brooklyn and Jason are forced to write and record a song together, but there's one tiny roadblock in their way - he can't stand her and she feels the same way about him! Jason is a broody, folksy musician whereas Brooklyn is a ""pop princess"". But she actually writes all of her own songs and is really a very warm, smart, funny, sarcastic woman who is lonely and wants to really experience love, not just write about it. Jason only sees the stereotype and is very judgmental toward her at first. 
 The Duet is very funny, witty, sexy and just plain un-put-downable. The author makes tons of pop culture references and give the reader lots of sneak peeks inside the business of producing popular music. The banter between Jason and Brooklyn is absolutely priceless and the story never sinks into sentimentality but instead stays fresh, modern and very, very witty. 
 Jason and Brooklyn begin a no-strings-attached sexual relationship which of course turns into much more for Brooklyn. I absolutely loved the sexy times between these two and I loved watching Jason's douche-y, ""asshole-ian"" (no, not a word!) facade slowly change. But he is hiding a whopper of a secret and I was sitting on the edge of my seat to see how this would play out. 
 The Duet is for sure a romantic comedy but it is much more. It is about accepting who you are, being true to yourself, always being honest and the importance of keeping your heart open to love.

You can absolutely read this as a standalone - but L.H. Cosway is such a talented writer that you should give Painted Faces a try, too. Nicholas is such a memorable and haunting character that I will always remember him. Beautiful, sexy, sensitive, angry and loving -- he is all these things and more. 
 ""I like to think of myself as a wonderful and unique snowflake."" 
 Killer Queen is basically Nicholas' POV along with some additional scenes. You really gain a lot of insight into Nicholas' character in this book and the Epilogue is absolutely fantastic. This is a very, very unique story - definitely not your standard contemporary romance - and it will change the way you look at gender and sexuality and men and women. I also loved the added touch of song lyrics at the beginning of each chapter to really match the tone of the story. 
 I love L.H. Cosway's writing and have every one of her books on my Kindle. Can't wait to read more by this incredibly gifted author.

 Kate McCarthy is a favorite author of mine but surprisingly this book just did not do it for me. Although the book features a very strong heroine and and a talented but tortured hero, which I loved, the plot of this book fell flat for me and the so-called scandal was absolutely not scandalous in my eyes at all. Lots of readers fell in love with this book so definitely give this one a try and judge for yourself.

 ""I squeezed him tight, because I already had what I wanted. Him. This. Us. Unfortunately, fantasies are for children and I was a grown woman. I should've known it wouldn't last."" 
 We are HUGE fans of Joanna Wylde's Reapers' Motorcycle Club series and Reaper's Stand might be our favorite book in the series so far! And that's saying a lot because each of these books are fantastic. But Picnic's story is grittier, edgier, meaner...and hello, we love that he is a bit older and has certainly lived a rough life. He has sex with loads of women since the death of his beloved wife, won't be tied down, but then meets London, who is a strong, independent woman. She has lots of burdens to bear and tries to make a go of things with out Picnic's help, but when these two get together...WOW. He's bad-ass, tough, sexy but funny and this story is one you just can't put down. 
 ""Just let me be strong for you for a minute, okay?"" He said softly. ""You've held on for a long time, sweetheart. Nobody can say you haven't been strong. But it's been a hell of a night, so why don't you let me hold you and help you right now, okay?"" 
 We found this book to be incredibly hot and sexy and much darker than most of the other books in this series. We absolutely loved these two together and Reaper's Stand is one of our favorite MC stories. It is violent but it is also real and the funny moments add some much-needed levity to the tense storyline. And the tease at the end...oh my lord!! The author gives us a peek at the next book in a new series and we cannot WAIT!!

I am trying to avoid using the word epic here as it has been overused a bit, but this story took me on an incredible journey that left me nothing short of anxious, elated, enchanted and drained. Penelope Ward is hands down one of my favorite authors and this book is an absolute must read. 
 The story follows Greta and Elec who are step-siblings. But like all of Ms. Ward's books, there are many layers and nuances to this book and nothing is quite as it seems. 
 ""I won't give you exactly the same thing...but I can give you more. Okay? I can give you better. It may be one night, but I will make every second count."" 
 Although Elec is her stepbrother, I really didn't feel that Greta's love for him was forbidden. You will have to read the book and judge for yourself on that one. What I did feel was the incredible sexual tension, emotion, surprise, and yes, even humor in Ms. Ward's writing. 
 ""Nowadays, every single guy seemed to pale in comparison to Elec on the physical attraction meter. I wanted to crush that meter with a sledgehammer."" 
 Greta is smart, quirky, funny and compassionate. Elec is angry, cocky, sexy and irresistible. Slowly but surely, Greta begins to see behind his angry facade and they eventually form a deep bond. 
 ""... I thought about how ironic it was that this guy who'd done nothing but try to chase me away and intimidate me was the one person in the world I felt like I wanted to protect."" 
 But this is only in the first part of the book! In true Penelope Ward style, STEPBROTHER DEAREST is a richly woven tale that spans many years. The characters grow, move on, and the story almost loops back on itself. No spoilers here, just read this sexy, funny, emotional and fascinating story for yourself. And be prepared to have your heart stolen by Elec.

 This was my first book by Nalini Singh and it is a passionate, emotional, sexy and fulfilling story. I loved this book! The writing is incredibly sexy, beginning right from almost the first page when sexy-as-hell rock god Fox meets the shy librarian Molly at a party. It might sound cliched but the story is so well written, and the characters so well-developed, that I was drawn in immediately. 
 Molly has her reasons for staying out of the spotlight so a good part of the book is spent with her anquishing over stepping into the public arena with a world-famous musician. But she is powerless to resist Fox, a man who knows what he wants and goes after it. This book is fast-paced and takes the reader around the globe to New Zealand, Australia and California. And the supporting characters are fantastic, from Molly's best friend Charlotte to all of the other band members. Can't wait to read more about all these characters. 
 This was a wonderful story and the sex is incredibly HOT!! The book also created the oh-so-important emotional connection between the main characters. I also absolutely fell in love with Fox! This story is a must-read and is a great begninning to a new series.

 These were my first thoughts upon finishing this book, an ARC of which was graciously provided by the author. Why was I on her ARC list? No clue. But I thank her from the bottom of my heart. This is an original story, with well-written, fully-developed characters, and clever twists and turns which forged a connection between the book and myself. Am I gushing? Yes. Because there are SO many books today that have cookie-cutter plots with cliche characters, I find it incredibly refreshing to come across a story like Black Lies. 
 There is no plot or character discussion here. Read the synopsis. That's all you need. Was this a 100% perfect story? No. But it is absolutely one of the best books I have read this year and I applaud Ms. Torre for her story.

 Gritty. Raw. Suspenseful. SEXY. Come take a wild ride through the author's City of Angels, and enjoy every second of the hot and thrilling rollercoaster ride. Antonio and Theresa got under my skin and I can't wait for even more of their story. 
 Ruin begins shortly after Spin ended. Theresa has become incredibly determined and strong and will do anything, ANYTHING, to protect and stay with Antonio. But he is lethal, dangerous and also determined to keep Theresa out of harm's way. Not an easy feat when the mafia is out ot get you and no one is to be trusted. 
 Theresa is still close to her family and Antonio ""Spin"" is acutely aware of that. But he will do whatever it takes to keep her safe, even when the things quite literally start to spin out of control. He tries to keep her isolated but she will have none of that and his carefully-crafted plans begin to quickly unravel and escalate to an incredibly satisfying conclusion. 
 This is an action-packed, super-hot and sexy story. The writing is gorgeous and spare. There are no flowery words, no gushing declarations in the world of Antonio Spinelli. But surprisingly, there is humor, which provides a welcome relief from the near-constant state of tension and almost primal sexual urges. Spin loves Theresa in his own way, and they are both completely obsessed with each other and cannot stay apart. 
 ""You're from a different world , but you smell like home to me. I haven't been to Napoli in ten years, but whenever you're near me, I smell olive flowers. My heart gets sick with thirst, and the water is poison."" 
 I can't stop thinking about Spin and Theresa. C.D. Reiss has become one of my favorite writers and I absolutely cannot wait for the next installment in this series.

 The Stage Dive series is one of my favorite series and Lead is an absolute delight. Sexy, refreshingly funny and smart, Lead not only features the achingly beautiful Jimmy, it also introduces us to the fabulous Lena, who in my opinion could be every woman's new best friend. Honest, funny and real, Kylie Scott has written a completely relatable heroine who at times broke my heart and other times had me laughing at loud. 
 Lena knew that Jimmy would be her Achilles heel almost from the get-go when she is hired to be his assistant and sobriety companion. 
 ""Whatever else he might be, Jimmy Ferris was special and complicated, beautiful and beastly, all rolled into one. A natural-born performer."" 
 Lena struggles to fit in to the rest of the band dynamics and all the sexy couples of the Stage Dive family. She is tenacious, hilarious and completely turned on and attracted to Jimmy, but the real Jimmy, not the rock-star persona. 
 ""My heroin was six-foot-one and gorgeous as sin."" 
 Lena has had her share of heartache, and is afraid that Jimmy will steal her heart away while she is working as his assistant and stomp on it in the process. I absolutely loved how strong Lena was and how she really stayed true to herself and did not try to hide her true feelings for Jimmy. Will these two get their happy ending that they so desperately deserve? 
 ""Love was truly one of life's mysteries. That it could f@@@ you five ways to Sunday and still remain so utterly perplexing and unknown was kind of impressive. I guess."" 
 Lead is a fabulous summer read and Kylie Scott is one of my favorite writers. Enjoy Lead, you will fall in love with Jimmy!!

The story is fresh and creative and I absolutely fell in love with Andrew. What starts off as cute storyline turns into a lovely, sweet and very, very funny story about overworked Gwen, who is struggling to manage raising two young children on her own, and Andrew, a wealthy, seemingly carefree guy, who must get a job and really wants to become responsible and self-sufficient and please his cold and distant father. 
 Eight Days a Week is a fantastic ""lighter"" read, with an unexpected storyline and interesting characters. My heart ached for Andrew; he has spent his life trying to please his parents and live up to his ""perfect"" older sister. He sees his chance at redemption when he becomes ""manny"" for Gwen's young family and actually finds something he is very good at. The children love him and of course, he is madly attracted to Gwen. But they both decide not to pursue their insane chemistry for the sake of the children, because what would happen if they broke up? 
 Will these two be able to love each other and keep their new family together? I adore Amber Johnson's writing style and was laughing out loud as well as totally swooning many times during this book.

 I really liked the romantic suspense aspect of this story, and I really admire the author for writing a strong female character. Oh look, it's okay to be a workaholic and be a professional! I am on board with female characters who are not just window-dressing or who do nothing but sorrt of flit around the story. But I digress. 
 Liis and Thomas do connect early on, but it really works in this book. Jamie can really write a steamy hot sex scene and I can't wait to read more of this from her!Liis is smart but she is pretty insecure in her personal life. 
 I'd gone from feeling sexy and desired to an embarassingly eager, cheap score. 
 Liis and Thomas must later work together as FBI agents and this aspect of the story was very fast-paced and interesting. Liis, like Thomas, is devoted to her work which has not left much time for a personal life. 
 ""Ah. You're married to the job. Betty Bureau."" 
 Thomas is a total hard-ass and has a notorious reputation for being impossible to work for. Will he soften for Liis? I loved seeing the other Maddox brothers make an appearance here, but make no mistake, this was Thomas' story through and through. This book is fast-paced, sexy, very romantic and a must-read for Jamie McGuire fans.

 This is the first book I have read by this writing duo and it certainly won't be the last! This is a gritty, thrilling and addictive story. Please note the series name - SEX and MAYHEM, and there's plenty of both! 
 This is a M/M Motorcycle Club book with a twist: Stitch, is a closeted gay biker. His MC is seriously homophobic and he is not out to his ex-wife or to his family. This guy is sex on a stick and and when he meets the sexy and alluring Zak, all bets are off. Zak is a tattoo artist and is completely out. They have explosive chemistry and these sex scenes are absolutely among the top 5 hottest scenes I have ever read. What begins as a sex-only relationship gradually builds into something more. Stitch grows as a character and little by little comes face to face with his own sexuality. 
 ""I had a bad night. All I wanted was to come home to you."" 
 Stitch and Zak have an intensely passionate relationship but Stitch still will not admit that he is gay. He imposes secrets and restrictions on Zak and Zak quite naturally rebels and much sex and mayhem ensues. I found this book to be incredibly gripping and the writing style fast-paced, gritty and intensely sexual. 
 Make no mistake, this book is incredibly violent and graphic. It is also filled with what I found to be highly erotic m/m sex and irresistible characters. I absolutely loved this very dark and emotional story and can't wait to read more from these authors!

DO NOT DISTURB is a thrilling, dark, sexy and fast-paced story with a twist! If you are looking for a dark, smart and erotic story, then DO NOT DISTURB is the book for you. 
 This book is the sequel to THE GIRL IN 6E, a fantastic and surprising story which I recommend that you read immediately!! The author continues the story of Deanna in DO NOT DISTURB and her story is intertwined with another character who might, just might, be as dark and disturbed as she is. But where Deanna tries her best to keep her dark nature hidden away and under control (barely), this new character does not. He is plain evil. The author has done a masterful job at building suspense and anticipation in this book and the plot twists are fantastic. This is a smart and twisted book and definitely NOT for the faint of heart. 
 Deanna is faced with danger here in the form of an unhappy client. Will he outsmart the brilliant Deanna and pierce the layers of protection she has built of around her? Will Deanna finally find some semblance of normalcy with the sexy and understanding Jeremy? Once again, the author writes a brilliant story that answers all these questions without talking down to the reader and without coming to any false conclusions. The tensions are high and the sexy times are brilliantly erotic. I haven't stopped thinking about these characters! I amy dying (well, not literally) for another book in this series!! Don't miss DO NOT DISTURB, it is a must-read book that will keep you on the edge of your seat!!

Kelsey and Archer were seen in the earlier Spiral of Bliss books but you do NOT have to read those books first (although they are fantastic and I highly recommend reading them NOW!!) One of my favorite couples, Dean and Liv, make an appearance here but the center of this amazing book is the stormy relationship between Kelsey and Archer. 
 ""I swallowed to ease the dryness in my throat. 
 'Do you always let fate decisions for you?' 
 'Fate makes better decisions than I do.' "" 
 Archer has always been a screw-up, an angry (and rightfully so), rootless man, drifting from job to job and never able to commit to much. He rides into the town of Mirror Lake already a changed man but his brother Dean only sees the old Archer, the addict and the womanizer. Enter Kelsey, the tightly-wound meteorology professor who needs to let go a little, and who knows that Archer is everything she should avoid. 
 ""He could push me to my limits and protect me the entire time."" 
 Kelsey and Archer immediately strike a ""deal"", agreeing to a temporary relationship while he is visiting with Dean and Liv. Suffice it to say, they both get more than they bargained for and both learn to see behind the other's facade and get to what's real and honest. All of this plays out against the almost-fairytale-like setting of Mirror Lake, which adds a very special magic to this incredibly sexy and adult story. 
 I must say that I absolutely love how Nina Lane can write about the world of college academics on the one hand and then turn around give us one of the dirtiest-talking characters EVER! (Phone sex, hello!) Archer is all man, commanding, bossy and completely honest with Kelsey. I found their relationship to be completely real and perfectly developed. I also loved the way Archer and Dean's relationship grew throughout this story, and the way Archer really matured and came to terms with his past. 
 BREAK THE SKY is tender, sexy, funny and incredibly satisfying. Another must-read from Ms. Nina Lane!

 This is my first book by Sawyer Bennett and I absolutely loved it! Sugar on the Edge reminds me why I love reading contemporary romance. It has emotion, perfect pacing, a lovely locale (the Outer Banks of North Carolina), a character-driven story and BLAZING hot sex. Gavin and Savannah are memorable, real and totally drew me into their story. 
 I have not read the other books in the Last Call series so I can tell you that this one can absolutely be read as a standalone, but now that I have sampled Ms. Bennett's writing, I will read them. There are other characters from the previous books but they are fully-written characters and I did not feel as though I was lost at all. 
 Gavin is in a lot of emotional pain and moves to North Carolina to finish writing a manuscript. He's sexy, British and has a very dark side. Savannah seems at first to be his total opposite - sweet, hard-working, yet smart and a little sassy. I literally read this book in one sitting and recommend it as a perfect read if you want a hot, sexy, funny, exciting and emotional story. I highly recommend Sugar on the Edge and am adding Ms. Bennett's other books to my TBR list immediately. Enjoy!

 Colleen Hoover is a must-read author for me. I always adore her books, the stories, the emotions, the characters, and Confess was no different. This book is pure magic, from the opening chapter to the very end. Confess is an intricately woven tale from beginning to end, where all of the characters are somehow connected and where everything is slowly revealed, little by little. 
 I absolutely fell in love with Owen. He is a gifted artist but has some very rocky relationships in his life. I just knew that I would grow to love him even though he seemed like he made some questionable choices early on in the book. Owen and Auburn are both very, very complicated characters and my heart nearly broke for Auburn and her situation. I could not put this story down and read it in practically one sitting. 
 ""I love you so much."" His voice is breathless and full of fear. ""I'll love you forever. Even when I can't."" My tears fall harder at his words. ""And I'll love you forever. Even when I shouldn't."" 
 You should read this book without any spoilers because the plot is very clever and there are surprises thrown in along the way. I love the creative plot and the paintings throughout the book are just magnificent. They tie into the story perfectly. I will confess that my ARC copy did not have the paintings so I bought a Kindle copy and I am so glad that I did. The paintings are haunting and very revealing. Even though this is a romantic story with some very emotional situations, there are definitely moments of humor which I greatly appreciated! 
 Confess is another must-read from one of my absolute favorite authors. It is a beautiful story about the power of trust and love and I didn't want Owen and Auburn's story to end.

 I absolutely love Melanie Harlow's Frenched Series! The heroines are strong, witty, sexy and very relatable. Coco is thrown together with her ex, Nick, a well-known chef who broke her heart years before. She has never really gotten over him and it seems that even though he broke up with her, he isn't over her, either. Melanie French writes sexy heroes who have a heart of gold, a strong romantic streak and who aren't afraid of strong women. The sex scenes in this book are UBER-hot and sweetly romantic at the same time. 
 Sometimes you need a sexy, light and super-romantic book in between some of the darker, heavier reads, and Forked fits the bill perfectly. Put Nick and Coco on your reading menu, you won't be disappointed!

(This is a novella that should be read as part of the fantastic Inside Out series and is not a stand alone.) We absolutely LOVE this incredibly original series and it remains one of our favorite series - it's original, thrilling, sexy and very addictive. A must-read. As for My Hunger, we see Mark dealing with the traumatic events surrounding Rebecca's disappearance as well as his mother's illness. He is still deeply affected by Rebecca but is now drawn to Crystal Smith, one of his top employees. 
 I have always loved Mark and his controlling ways. He is attempting to become Master to Crystal but she is very different from his other submissives. Will he be able to fight their overwhelming attraction? 
 I loved their banter and sexual tension and Lisa Renee Jones is such a talented writer that she only makes me want more from Mark's POV. He is one of my favorite characters from the series. This is a fairly quick, very sexy read, and I highly recommend it. Enjoy!

 Once in a while, a book comes along that absolutely throws you for a loop and knocks your socks off and I'm happy to say LOCK & KEY is one of those books. A story about a 42-year-old heroine who has sacrificed her whole life to the One-Eyed Jacks MC, LOCK & KEY is hot, sexy, thrilling, perfectly written and filled with characters that I won't soon forget. 
 Grace and Lock meet right at the beginning of the story and sparks fly. They are both damaged and not looking to connect with another human being on any kind of meaningful level. They spend an incredibly HOT night together ((hello, ice cube scene!!), thinking they'll never see each other again, but boy, are they dead wrong. 
 I fell in love with Lock, he is one bad-ass biker but he knows a good thing is right in front of him. The problem is, will he realize what a treasure Grace is before she slips away? 
 ""I had my dream on my hands and in my mouth, and I never fucking realized."" 
 This story is perfectly told in both a combination of flashbacks and alternating POVs. The book unfolds like a flower petal, layer by layer peeled away until the reader is left incredibly satisfied at the end. This is a long and meaty book, filled with plenty of drama and scorching hot sex scenes, but I literally could not put it down until the very end. Ms. Porter has created a world of memorable characters, Alpha bikers, strong and feisty women and a solid story that will stay with me for a long time to come. 
 I highlighted half the book but instead I am ""borrowing"" the author's teasers. This is an original and very creative story so I don't want to give any of the plot away. Add Lock & Key to your TBR list immediately! This is a must-read book for all fans of strong writing, characters with backbone and beautiful stories about the importance of family and second-chance love. Ms. Porter deserves a place among Joanna Wylde, Madeline Sheehan and dare I say Ms. Kristen Ashley with her absolutely incredible debut MC romance book. Go meet Grace and Lock. I know you will be as captivated as I was.

 ""Because I can't stand the girl underneath,"" she whispered 
 ""Why the tattoos?"" Lexi asked 
 ""Because I can't bear seeing the scars of my past."" 
 Tillie Cole is a very gifted writer and this story is fascinating, heartbreaking, beautiful, funny, tender and wonderfully written. This is not exactly your typical jock-meets-Goth-girl story, it is much richer and more nuanced than that, and I really recommend you give this book a try. 
 You do not need to have read the other books in the series (I did not but I plan to read them now) to follow Lexi and Austin's story. Austin is the star player on the University of Alabama's football team, and Lexi is part of the cheerleading squad. But he is also a tattooed, former gang member struggling to break free from his past. She, too, has her own painful struggles that are handled with incredible sensitivity and care by Tillie Cole. 
 There were many times during this book that I was afraid something terrible would happen to Austin or Lexi, and I read the story with my heart pounding. Austin is a beautiful boy inside and out and showed great compassion and caring for others, all hidden beneath his tattooed, tough-guy exterior. Lexi struggles to keep it together, even as all others see is an offbeat but talented cheerleader on a very tough college squad. 
 Sweet Fall is very much about not judging a book by its cover and not expecting others to conform to your idea of of ""perfect"". Acceptance, of both yourself and of others, is the message I took from this story and I applaud the author for writing about a very difficult and painful subject. I highly recommend Sweet Fall and I can guarantee you will fall in love with Austin Carillo!

Yes, I LOVE Van, and for those of you who have read Deliver, you know that he is twisted, really f*ed up and obsessively, possessively in love with Liv. He seemed BAD through and through but I knew better! I couldn't wait to read his story because I knew there was much more to him. 
 Vanquish totally blew me away. It is really a story of two painfully lonely people who really only want to connect with another human being on the most basic of levels. But this being a Pam Godwin story, well, you get two very effed up people, tons of mind-blowing sex, and lots of danger thrown into the mix. 
 Pam Godwin's writing is pure perfection. There is no insta-connection, the emotions are real and the sexual chemistry is explosive. This book has it all. And Amber broke my heart. I am a huge Pam Godwin fan and I will devour every book she writes. Vanquish is raw, gritty, beautiful, suspenseful, sexy and painful.

 Alice Clayton writes very realistic and humorous banter between Simon and Caroline and I laughed out loud through many parts of this book. An added plus is the incredible chemistry between these two and the sexy times are absolutely hot and very satisfying! This story is about real-life, Simon and Caroline have real-world professions and work hard just like lots of outer couples to make their passionate relationship work. Jobs, friends, family, and yes, even all-seeing Clive all intervene into their blissful existence. 
 I loved the way Simon and Caroline's relationship grows in this book. They learn more about each other and their witty banter is funny and realistic. Caroline has to make some tough decisions this book but all is done with good grace and humor. There is no over-the-top drama or contrived situations. But Simon is absolutely still gorgeous, sexy, romantic and swoon-wrothy and can still sweep Caroline off her feet. 
 I also loved all of the supporting characters, and Simon and Caroline's friends play a major role in Rusty Nailed. I can't wait to read more about them in upcoming books in this series. Rusty Nailed is everything you expect from Alice Clayton: intelligent, witty dialogue; steamy chemistry; and true love and caring not only between Simon and Caroline, but between all of their friends. I can't wait for Screwdrivered!

Both sweet and sexy at the same time, Left Behind is a wonderful story of loss, strength, emotion and first love. The story is very engaging and the characters are very real. Nikki and Zack's story totally drew me in, and once I started, I read this book in one sitting. 
 Told in alternating POV's, which actually become one story, Left Behind tells the story of Nikki, who relocates to California after the death of her mother. Having lived a very lonely and sad life, she is apprehensive about starting over. But Nikki is very strong because she had to grow up at an early age. She doesn't want anyone's pity and just wants to be a normal teenager. 
 To her eyes, Zack lives an almost-perfect life, with a stable family and seemingly happy home life. But Zack has faced a terrible tragedy and is dealing with it in his own way. Angry and guilt-stricken, he is confused over his feelings for Nikki. There is a twist to this story that wasn't really a surprise, but I was literally holding my breath through most of this book, hoping against hope that nothing would come between Nikki and Zack! 
 The authors really hit a home run with Zack. He took my breath away! Zack is one incredibly sweet, romantic and sexy guy. I loved Zack and Nikki together. I also love how this book dealt with some very adult subjects in a very sensitive way. This book contained just the right mix of sexy romance and emotion. Combined with the inventive story, it is great young adult book.

 What a perfectly dark ending to one of my favorite dark romance series! I read for escape and Monsters in the Dark offers just that. Pepper Winters has created a dark, sexy and highly erotic series with two unforgettable characters. Tess and Q are both damaged, flawed and perfectly matched for each other. I adore this series and read this intense story almost in one sitting. 
 Q was born into darkness, but he'd never baptized me in his blackest desires. And because of that, I could implicitly say he spoke the truth. No matter what he did to me, he would never truly harm me. 
 Told in dual POV's, this book is very, very dark and offers some BDSM along with the highly unusual relationship between Tess and Q. Having settled into married life, Q is hiding something from Tess that he fears will break them apart. But Tess is strong, brave and absolutely devoted to Q. She will let nothing and no one come between them! 
 We come alive when we're together with no cages or locks between us. 
 Q is fascinating and irresistible. I love him!! JE SUIS A TOI is a very graphic story but it is truly Pepper Winters at her best. I'm very sad to see this series end but looking forward to what is next from this author!

 This story is told in the very clever way of Chase/Charlie looking back over time and telling his story through the format of looking through a photo album of his life. I adored this. The story itself is a beautifully-written mix of humor, pain, steam and sweetness. I can't wait to read more from this author. 
 Charlie/Chase has always been true to himself, which has not been easy for other men in his life. I loved his honesty! Although the book is told from three different POV's, it is really Charlie who is the main character in this story. Scott is his first love and their story is hot, sweet and heartbreaking. Scott moves away abruptly but remains the love of Charlie's life. Years later, Charlie meets Adan and thinks that maybe he could love again. The way these three eventually come together is both surprising and totally hot. The character development is fantastic and the writing, to me, almost flawless.

 LOVE Nix!! I read a lot of biker books so I was totally surprised when I finished Incandescent and loved it! Kadence is a schoolteacher and never expects to fall for the oh-so-hot Nix who is the parent of one of her students. He is a bad-ass biker with a heart of gold, trying his best to parent his son Z with a no-good ex-wife who is always causing problems. 
 Kadence has dealt with a lot of past pain (both physical and emotional) and the last thing she expects is to fall for Nix. But the man is persistent and can't stay away from the sexy teacher. 
 ""I haven't been able to get you out of my mind, woman. Your attitude, your body, from the moment I had you on the back of my bike, I knew I was in trouble. You feel it too, Kadence. I know you do. Stop denyin' it."" 
 These two have tons of chemistry but there are some obstacles in their way. For one thing, Nix is the parent of Kadence's student, and the school has a no-dating policy between parents and teachers. Add to that one crazy ex-wife, and an even crazier (and more dangerous) ex of Kadence's and you have lots of fast-paced drama and totally HOT sexy times. This book takes dirty-talking to a new level, and River Savage has quite the talent at writing absolutely SIZZLING sex scenes! 
 This is a fast-paced, hot biker romance with a lot of heart. I loved Kadence and Nix and adored how Nix got Kadence to open up to him. 
 ""I want this man. Want everything he was doing to me, and then more.""

 I really loved the latest book in the Wild Seasons series! It is very, very funny, had really hot scenes and a wonderful storyline. Harlow is a funny, smart-ass, modern and smart heroine. Finn is another nuanced, sexy and loving leading man created by this fabulous writing duo. This is not a cliched contemporary romance story but instead has some very serious themes woven into the story. 
 Harlow and Finn have lots of miscommunications throughout the story but their scenes together are fantastic and their chemistry feels real and genuine and never forced. I truly thought that the authors could not top the first book in this series but Harlow and Finn are every bit as addictive as the characters from Sweet Filthy Boy. 
 These two are at opposite ends of the spectrum personality-wise but their banter and sexy times are hilarious and very, very hot. Don't miss this book. It is a wonderful, passionate and very funny read with lots and lots of heart.

 Hush is the last installment in the very dark story of characters that I will not soon forget. If you have waited until all the books are out in this series, well, wait no more! I highly recommend this highly imaginative and incredibly twisted series. All of the hype surrounding these books is very well-deserved, in my opinion. Nina/Elizabeth, Declan, Bennett, Pike...I grew to care deeply about each and every one. I will never forget this conclusion to this series. While I am saddended that this is the end of the series, I cannot wait to see what E.K. Blair dreams up next. 
 If you have read the first two books, you know that Elizabeth has lived through unimaginable suffering. BANG, the first book in this series, is one of my top favorite books ever. The emotions, the thrills and the incredible darkness in that book left me reeling. The characters have come full circle here, and although the author certainly stays true to the dark nature of the series, the ending was perfect for these characters. 
 ""We are monsters and lovers, animals and killers, but nothing can extinguish what we have when we're together."" 
 As I was coming to the ending of HUSH, I thought, ""Where is the author going with this? There are only a few more pages left! GAH!!"" E.K. Blair never takes the easy way out and she remained fiercely honest to each of her characters in this series. Sympathies will be challenged and emotions will be tested in HUSH. I am being vague because there is an incredibly risky and very surprising conclusion to this series and it must be experienced first-hand while reading, without knowing any spoilers. Don't skip to the end!! It has been days since I finished this book and these characters are still filling my head and my heart. Don't miss HUSH and don't miss the BLACK LOTUS Series. You won't soon forget these stories.

 This is not your typical high school drama, Bronagh and Dominic fight like cats and dogs which is kind of like their foreplay. She is also feisty, likable, curses all the time, and has some body issues. I loved her! The relationship between the two main characters is unpredictable and fresh. I also absolutely loved all the Slater Brothers and look forward to reading more about their exploits. 
 This book is written in Irish dialect which the author explains right out of the box. I enjoyed it but it might be a little much for some readers to digest. This book is also hilarious and contains more F words than I think any book I have ever read. Dominic has some very endearing characters and totally hot sex scenes. I guarantee this book is different from any book you have read so far this year! Give it a try if you love strong heroines and gorgeous, Alpha fighters.

Scoring Wilder is the perfect summer read - sexy, funny, swoon-y and fast-paced. I fell in love with Liam (and Kinsley a little bit) from the beginning, and Liam didn't let go of my heart for the entire book! This story is the perfect combination of a smart, strong, witty heroine, a sexy, good-hearted bad boy, and a yummy story that is head and shoulders above most books in the genre. 
 Even if you are not a fan of New Adult books, you will LOVE Scoring Wilder! Liam Wilder is a famous professional soccer player with a bad-boy reputation. Of course, much of it is due to the ever-present media and some undeserved bad press. Kinsley is a smart, driven, talented and FUNNY rising soccer star who immediately falls in lust with her new soccer coach. They are acutely aware that they are forbidden to be together, and Kinsley has some very, very funny moments when she is struggling to fight her growing attraction to her soccer coach. 
 Oh - and Kinsley's previous relationships ended VERY badly so she doesn't trust anyone, let alone a tattoo-covered, world-famous soccer star. But Liam turns out to be a total sweetheart, romantic, honest, open and giving. But will Kinsley come to her senses in time? 
 Scoring Wilder has plenty of steam, hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments, plus a gorgeous soccer-playing hero. What's not to love? If you are looking for a perfect summer read, Scoring Wilder is for you!

He is my favorite part of this story and is a very, very complex character. For all of his very, very bad equalities, and there are many, he really loves Karissa and will let nothing stand in the way of keeping her safe. This is a very twisty story that begins in Book #1 and is part intense love story and part suspense story. 
 Torture to Her Soul was a tiny bit slow for me midway through the story only because I have such high esteem for J.D. Darhower and her storytelling abilities. But the characters and the story are really fantastic and Mafia romances are one of my favorites genres. So I completely loved Naz, even when I hated him. 
 This entire story is solely from Naz's POV and is a fascinating look inside his very dark mind. I could not wait for this conclusion to the incredible story from Monster in His Eyes and it did not disappoint. A must-read for all fans of darker romance.

All of the other characters play a role in the story but the author did a great job at making this purely Nico and Sophie's story. I absolutely LOVED the dirty-talking, possessive and sweet Nico! I was surprised at the quick way they met and fell for each other, as I am not usually a fan of Insta-love. But it worked perfectly here. 
 """"You know, the moment I saw you, I knew you were the one for me,"" I say gently, watching her eyes get big. ""You're mine, Sophie. Every beautiful inch of you is mine."" 
 Nico is the love-'em-and-leave-'em type. He is also very family-oriented, sexy as hell and willing to take his time (sort of) with the shy and closed-off Sophie. The sex scenes are AMAZING and off-the-charts steamy! 
 ""I know what I want. I always get what I want. And that's the last thought in my head before I fall asleep.""

 The Resistance completely took me by surprise with its perfect writing, passionate and heartfelt characters, and absolutely fantastic sexy times!! This is the first book I have read by S.L. Scott and I can't wait to read her other novels. 
 I went into this blind and was drawn right into the fast-paced story of Holliday and Jack. Thank God for a smart, strong heroine! I am so tired of weak, cookie-cutter heroines and Holli was a breath of fresh air. She created her own business and the corporate side of this story was very realistic and not over-dramatized like many books have done lately. So thank you, Ms. Scott, for that. Holli doesn't need anyone, she's lonely but wrapped up in growing her business. So Jack Dalton is the last person she expects to fall for when she attends a convention in Las Vegas. 
 They have immediate chemistry but he is actually a very sensitive, lonely guy who also looking for a deeper connection than his usual parade of one-night stands. 
 Trust me, this book is so well-written that I lost myself in the words and read this in almost 1 day. I wish I would have read The Resistance slower! The storyline is also rich with other characters, and of course, lots and lots of hot sex. 
 I must feel that the main characters are emotionally connected to each other, and the author succeeds on all levels. I as a reader also must feel a connection to the characters and I really cared about Jack and Holli. Their dialogue is witty, they both grow emotionally during the story, and I can't say anything negative at all about The Resistance. I absolutely love a rock star story that explores the perils of fame and excess, and this book also does that perfectly.

 If the mark of a good book is that you can't stop thinking about it, then CORRUPT is a winner. I love dark books but even I was close to not finishing this one due to the darkness and rage that filled the early part of the book. But what a story!!! Dark, sexy, thrilling, action-packed...and filled with twists and turns that took this cynical dark romance reader by surprise. 
 Let me be clear that if Penelope Douglas wrote a grocery list, I would read it. BULLY is one of my favorite books and her new contemporary romance MISCOUNDUCT is one of the best books I've read this year. So there's my disclaimer! 
 If you are looking for a gripping, edge-of-your-seat book, then CORRUPT is for you. It is rough, it is scary, it is sexy...but it is ultimately incredibly thrilling and emotionally satisfying. And the sex scene near the end of the book? Holy moly. Kudos to you, Ms. Douglas, you thrilled even this jaded erotica reader. 
 AS I was reading, I couldn't help but fear for Rika and the dire circumstances she found herself in. But she's an unusual female protagonist in that she literally could give as good as she got, and she never, ever once cowered or allowed herself to be overpowered by the ""Four Horsemen."" I still think about all of these characters weeks after finishing this book. And that to me is what makes a good book great. 
 CORRUPT is not your average dark romance. It is really a stand-out book. Highly, highly recommended.

 What an addictive and enjoyable story! Nicola Haken is a new author for me and I will definitely read more of her books. Being Sawyer Knight is not only an incredibly hot and sexy story, it is also filled with plenty of tender and emotional moments and a beautiful message about learning to love and accept yourself. 
 Sawyer Knight is a world-famous musician who longs for people to see the real him and not just his rock-star stage persona. He has very little to do with his mother, and had an abusive stepfather who was only interested in Sawyer's fame as a musician. He hasn't spoken to his best friend Jake since they were teenagers, when Sawyer could not deal with Jake making his true feelings known for Sawyer. 
 Jake has followed Sawyer's career and is the only person who has ever really known the real Sawyer. He comes back into Sawyer's life as his bodyguard and is still very much in love with Sawyer. Now he just has to convince Sawyer that they belong together. The chemistry between these two is literally explosive and burns up the pages! I absolutely fell in love with Jake and his bossy, dominating ways. He cannot stay away from Sawyer, but will Sawyer admit his true feelings for Jake? 
 This book is told in dual POV's which I thought worked great. There is a side plot involving death threats to the band but to me, it is the scorching hot sex scenes between Jake and Sawyer that made this book come alive. Nicola Haken is an incredibly talented writer and I devoured this book almost in one sitting. There is also a beautiful love story at the heart of this book and I was sad to see Jake and Sawyer's story end! I can't wait to read Ryder's story, which is coming up next.

From the start, I was having palpitations. You know when you're reading and you're waiting for a disaster to happen? That was me. I empathized with the main character right from the Prologue. This is my kind of book - Louis is 30, wealthy, hot, a womanizer with a really foul mouth. What more can you ask for? Emily is 18 years old and meets Louis while filling in as a waitress for her sister's catering job. She can't keep her eyes off this magnetic man, who has every women salivating for him. She notices that his eyes are following her the entire time. But he just leaves that night without saying a word to her. Her obsession starts from that day. All she does is fantasze about him. Louis hired her sister's company for more parties. She find out it's him and signs up to work the jobs. Louis approaches her and lets her know how he can't stop thinking about her, and how much he wants her. They go out for coffee and dinner but he is so cocky that she sets him straight, and from there on he switches because he realizes just because she's young, she's not a push over. Their obsession for each grows, they can't be without each other. They are consumed with one another. She lives for only him. He changes his lifestyle for her, stops sleeping around and breaks up the the ""boys"", his best friends. 
 Will his past interfere, and her insecurities doom them?

 Thank the gods for Mia Sheridan! Becoming Calder is so very beautiful, my heart was overflowing in some parts, and breaking in others. This story is completely original and the characters are so brave and honest, that I was lost in this book from beginning to end. 
 Calder and Eden's story is very unconventional and is very painful in parts. But their bond is so strong and passionate, that I just knew that they would be able to withstand any heartache and pain that came their way. I feel very strongly about the type of ""community"" that Eden and Calder lived in, and many scenes were almost too painful to read. I feel that the author absolutely nailed the psychological and physical abuse so accurately that it blew me away. This story unfolds layer by layer, with the reader joining in Calder's slowly dawning realization that he and his family did NOT, in fact, live in a paradise. 
 ""We hadn't chosen this life. It had chosen us."" 
 Calder and Eden's love is almost magical. But there is plenty of off-the-charts heat and longing between them to satisfy every contemporary romance reader. The story has tons of twists and turns and there are so many obstacles thrown at Calder and Eden that I was afraid they wouldn't survive. 
 ""Where do you find your strength, Morning Glory, he had asked me. 
 From you, I had said, smiling and pulling him close."" 
 Try to read this book without reading too many reviews with spoilers. Becoming Calder is passionate, refreshingly original and completely satisfying. A must-read!!

Many thanks to the author for the ARC because once I started reading, I absolutely could not put it down. Karissa is a poor college student, struggling in particular with a Philosophy class. The professor is a jerk and if she gets a low grade in the class, she will lose her scholarship. 
 Naz and Clarissa meet by chance outside the classroom when he stops to pay a visit to her professor. He is the quintessential bad boy, but a wealthy one, and slowly begins to sweep Karissa off her feet. She leads a very quiet and simple life, and finds herself falling hard for the incredibly sexy and overwhelming Naz. This is NOT the standard innocent-girl-meets-older-rich-guy trope, instead there are INCREDIBLE twists and some scorching hot sex!! 
 Naz is a bad boy but he really does treat Karissa like a princess.

 This book HOOKED me from the first page until the very end. The author has given me another great love with M, and the story to me was every bit as gripping and gut-wrenching as Jesse and Ava's story. I was SO excited to read an early copy of this book!! One Night: Promised is a 6-star read for me and it is NOT to be missed. 
 Livy is a very relatable woman, a bit of an underachiever but working hard to put her past dysfunctional family life behind her. She leads a rather quiet and sad life. At first, she resists the mysterious stranger who visits her coffee shop, but M is nothing if not persistent and she finds herself accepting his very risky proposition - spend just one glorious night together. 
 ""I know a bad thing when I see it, and standing behind me is a man who could crush my logic."" 
 M is HOT and if you think this is a standard romance story, you are WRONG. M is nuanced, damaged, and yes, ultimately very lovable and Livy falls hard. This book has a TON of twists and heart-stopping turns so this review will be spoiler-free. The story is filled with fantastic, memorable characters including a wonderful supporting cast of friends and the amazing, funny and incorrigible Nan, Livy's grandmother. 
 Livy has blocked off her emotions for a very long time but she cannot resist M's no-strings-attached proposition. He makes her feel alive, BUT she does push back at certain points in the story which I found to be very believable and true to her character. M has many, many faults, and he turns out to be a very flawed, very human character. I fell in love with him immediately. 
 ""I've always tried to keep my life simple, but now I'm craving a complication - a tall, dark-haired, mysterious complication."" 
 I absolutely LOVED the gentlemanly, ""formal"" side of M. It fit in perfectly with his personality. This book has a slow build to it but you will be generously rewarded by sticking to the story. The author 
 thrilled me to my very soul by the end of the book. M to me is a actually a very loving person, wrapped up in a stunningly handsome, rather cold exterior. He makes makes a real effort to be close to Livy, to treasure her and care for her in his own way. 
 ""Beautiful things should be savored, Livy, not rushed."" 
 Overall, One Night: Promised is one of my top reads of the year so far. I absolutely cannot wait for November!! 
 ""Each and every moment will be etched on that beautiful mind of yours forever. Every kiss. Every touch. Every word.""

 5 stars!! 
 Jodi Ellen Malpas is a genius at making you feel sorry for her Alpha male even though he is so f*****d up, and knowing the heroine should RUN not walk the other way! I wanted Livy to stay and fight for Miller. And the author's phrasing is absolutely epic. I fell in love with the characters all over again in this book and wanted more. 
 I adored One Night Denied. I felt that Ms. Malpas really tapped into Miller's emotions and even though I believe that we really don't know his whole story yet, I was okay with the parts of his past that the author revealed. I loved this book even more than the first one and I cannot wait for the third book. 
 Ellen: 
 4.5 stars!! 
 I absolutely fell in love with Miller Hart all over again. This book begins right after Book 1 so there will be no spoilers here. The passion and the intensity that Miller feels for Livy were the best parts of the book for me. My heart broke for him in this book, and I was praying that Livy would get beyond her own painful past and let Miller love her. This is a man truly and deeply in love and he would let nothing and no one stand in his way. That is one of the many things that I love about the author's tortured heroes. 
 ""I'm madly fascinated by you, Olivia Taylor. You fill my dark world with light and my hollow heart with feelings. I've persistently informed you that I'll never go down easily."" 
 While I was not as obsessed with this book as I was with One Night: Promised, I absolutely loved it and I am very impatiently waiting for the next installment in Miller and Livy's story. Jodi Ellen Malpas remains one of my favorite contemporary romance authors and I treasure every word she writes.

No need - Colt steps right in when he sees Mel struggling to work three jobs.

 Torrent took me by surprise and didn't let go of my heart until the last word. I need Book #2! Rafe is one of the most dangerous but most sympathetic characters I've come across in a long time. I can absolutely see why Alex has been in love with him since she was a young girl. She has lived a very rough life, perfect from the outside but tortured behind closed doors. She has had to endure unimaginable abuse, both emotional and physical. 
 Heed the warnings on this book, the story is a rough one, but it is incredibly well-written, totally sexy and has a fantastic, creative plot. I loved the dual POV's which were a great way to garner sympathy for even an unsympathetic character. This is a story of obsession, lust, love and revenge, and I loved every word. Gemma James has now become a 1-click author for me. She has created a world that I did not want to leave once I finished Torrent, and isn't that the best form of escapism? 
 The ending will leave you reeling and dying for the next book in this series. Not sure I can wait until release and I have already ordered the next book!

 Um...wow...what did I just read? If It Drives is hands-down my favorite book in the Market Garden series. This story focuses on ""Red Tie guy"", the wealthy banker James Harcourt. 
 His driver Cal has a crush on James, and wants to figure out why James keeps going back to Market Garden when Cal is available and literally right in front of his face. One night they cross over the employer/employee line, and what a night it is! But something seems lacking, and Cal feels that he can't quite give James what he really needs. Cal then embarks on a journey to explore his own Dom side and he and James have some smoking hot scenes together. But will James realize that Cal wants more than meaningless, one-night stands? 
 If It Drives turned into a quite tender and lovely romance between Cal and James in between all the scorching hot scenes. I absolutely loved the development of their Dominant/submissive relationship and did I mention the sex scenes BURN UP up the page? I also loved the emotional connection between the characters, and Cal's inner dialogue. He came across as surprisingly thoughtful and sweet, an interesting mix with his Dom tendencies. 
 This is a fantastic addition to the Market Garden series and I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a gutsy, sexy and surprisingly emotional love story.",Tue Apr 01 10:49:20 -0700 2014,Tue Apr 01 12:13:48 -0700 2014,,,2,0

This book was released under Entangled Embrace, so it's not quite as dirty but I absolutely loved it! This is Willa and Shane's story. Willa first appeared in 'Protecting What's His', from the author's Line of Duty series, and I have been looking forward to her story ever since we met Ginger's younger sister. 
 Willa has won a photography contest and the prize is a trip to Ireland. She has broken up with her boyfriend and is tortured over whether she did the right thing. She is met at the airport by her ride to the bed-and-breakfast, none other than the handsome, sexy and apparently very angry Shane. He is none to happy to be burdened with fetching Willa from the airport and they immediately argue. She stands up to him, which most people do not do, and fireworks ensue. 
 Unfixable is a sexy, layered and nuanced story that captured my attention from the beginning to end. Tortured, sexy Irishman with a soft heart? Check. Beautifully described Irish locales? Check. Troubled, insecure and beautiful heroine? Check! Add some really hot and sexy times and you have a perfect romance novel. 
 The characters are all incredibly well-written, Shane and Willa both have issues that they must come to terms with, and above it all, this book has real heart. I absolutely love Tessa Bailey's books and will read anything this woman writes.

Sweet Filthy Boy is the first book in Wild Seasons, a new series from these authors, and if the next books are anything like this one, this will be an AMAZING series! I really didn't expect to love Sweet Filthy Boy as much as I did, but the story and the characters drew me right in and this book far exceeded my expectations. 
 This book starts out with a twist and builds from there. Mia and her friends go to Las Vegas after college graduation as a gift from the parents of one of the friends. Mia is determined to let loose for a weekend before she follows her father's wishes and heads off the graduate business school in Boston. She gets more than she bargained for after one wild night with the gorgeous, sexy but oh-so-sensitive Ansel, who is visiting from France. 
 Mia decides to spend the summer with Ansel in France. This book really transports the reader to the different locales and I loved being lost in the story. Las Vegas, San Diego, Paris... the cities each almost became another character in the book. I absolutely fell in love with Ansel and the sexy times in this story are SMOKING HOT, off the charts! The writing is perfection and I want to get to know all of the characters better! 
 I really wasn't sure how this book was going to turn out, and I was glued to the pages until the very end. I loved this book, I loved Ansel and can't wait for more in this series!

I don't know where she dreamed up this storyline from, but it is gripping, erotic, gut-wrenching, suspenseful and incredibly creative all at once. I fell in love with all of the characters, and was blown away by the fantastic story. 
 Bang is an absolute must-read! It is highly erotic and very, very dark. And yes, the ending will totally leave you guessing as to what happens next. I miss these characters and can't wait for the next book in this series!

 I have a confession to make: I read this book a while ago and have simmered over what I could possibly write that would do justice to this unexpectedly sexy, warm-hearted and funny story. Slow Burn was nothing that I expected from Ms. Bromberg, and it totally took me by surprise and blew me away!! 
 Ah, Becks and Haddie. If you think you know them from the Driven Trilogy, you will see them in a whole new light in Slow Burn. With that being said, this book can absolutely be read and enjoyed as a standalone. Becks and Haddie had one night together and he knows in his heart that he won't be able to stay away from Haddie, even though she presents a tough-as-nails exterior to the world. He sees the real her. I read this book literally on the edge of my seat and I have never appreciated Ms. Bromberg's brand of humor more!

 Oh Mia, what have you done to my heart? 
 If you have read Mia Asher's first book ARSEN, then you know she is a master storyteller, taking the reader down one path and then surprising you with a twist that you didn't see coming. And that is exactly the way I felt when reading EASY VIRTUE. This book drew me in, grabbed me and didn't let go! I read this incredibly HOT book almost in one sitting. Blaire seems unlikeable, cold and calculating from the outside, but she really is a product of her sad childhood and massive insecurities that have shaped her adult life. Is she really capable of real love? I think so but you have to read this gem of a book for yourself to find out. 
 I absolutely fell in love with Ronan, he seems the perfect match for Blaire and he might be the one to show her true love. There are lots of twists and turns in this book and it should be read without reading any spoilers. It is the kind of book that warrants a re-read because there are hints dropped here and there about the future of the story. Make no mistake, this is an incredibly sexy and fast-paced read, and will have you turning the pages until the very end. My only complaint: I NEED MORE RONAN, NOW!! Highly recommended!!

 This incredible book begins with this beautiful dedication: 
 ""To every child who waited for a savior that never came."" 
 You don't need to be a fan of fighter books to absolutely cherish this heartbreaking and ultimately incredibly uplifting story of Rex and Georgia. Fighting for Flight is one of my top reads so far of 2014 and stayed with me long after I finished. 
 This book paints a vividly detailed picture of the heartbreaking pasts of Rex and Georgia. He was in foster care with her, but he had a nightmarish childhood that haunts him in expected ways as an adult. He is troubled both sexually and emotionally and can never quite put his finger on what is at the root of his problems. He does know that he is attracted to the somewhat elusive new friend. 
 Rex is both a singer in a band and a fighter. While he can't recall his childhood, she holds the key to his past, and while she is desperately trying to correct her past mistakes, and alleviate some of the crushing guilt she has carried with her for her entire life, she doesn't always go about it in the best way. Assumptions are made, hearts are broken, beautiful words are spoken...and during this incredible book, I absolutely fell in love with Rex. 
 ""The pain. It's the only thing that reminds me I'm alive. When most of the time I wish I were dead."" 
 Georgia understands Rex on a very deep and intimate level and their scenes together are breathtaking! I was blown away by the incredible intimacy and deep emotional connection Ms. Salsbury created between the two characters, a connection that is often missing for me in most books. 
 The author doesn't try to gloss over Rex's horrific childhood. His present-day obsessive-compulsive disorder is honestly dealt with and very detailed. I loved the fact that Rex was also a musician and his lyrics are testament to the author's incredible writing talent and creativity: 
 Vivid dreams, different faces 
 Waves of hate and lust in traces 
 Festering sickness, my insides rot 
 There's no pill for what I've got. 
 Fighting to Forget is a must-read. It has steam, unforgettable characters, a heartbreaking storyline, intensity, creativity and emotion. Do not miss this one!! Jamie Salsbury has become my new 1-click author and I can't wait for more books in this series.

Our heroine Nila is a successful fashion designer, although she has led a somewhat sheltered life (which actually plays quite nicely into the storyline). On the night of her big runway show, she encounters Jethro Hawk and she senses immediately that her life will change. And does it ever. 
 ""That was my last day of freedom. The last day that was my own."" 
 As a huge Pepper Winters fan, I absoultely loved this mind-f* of a story and the dark elements did not disturb me, but only enthralled me. It seems as though the demanding Jethro has no redeeming qualities, but I feel there are hints of much more to come about this mysterious man in the future installments. He fascinated me. The story is quite twisty and yes, somewhat fantastical, but this is a true page-turner, no doubt about it. 
 ""One mistake six hundred years ago put a curse on her entire family. One mistake sold her life to me in a mountain of unpayable debt. I inherited her. I preyed on her. I owned her life and had the piece of paper to prove it.""

 Seriously, how can I even begin to discuss a book that has shot to the top of my list of favorite books ever? Colleen Hoover has written another magical, perfect story that will grab your heartstrings and will not let go until the very end. I have to make this review intentionally vague because there is a major plot twist in Maybe Someday that must be experienced first-hand and should not be known before you start reading this book. 
 ""Sometimes in life, we need a few bad days in order to keep the good ones in perspective."" 
 Truer words were never spoken. Sydney and Ridge's story was like nothing I have read before. And Maybe Someday is SO much more than just a book, there is a gorgeous soundtrack that accompanies the story and makes this an unforgettable reading and listening experience. 
 Ridge is hands-down my new favorite book boyfriend. Ms. Hoover has taken a familiar genre, and created an imaginative and unexpected story that surprised and thrilled me and left me with a serious book hangover after finishing. This book is perfection and it is an absolute must-read!!

 Wow! A true m/m contemporary romance with two gorgeous, loving and confident men! I loved this book. I read a lot of m/m books and Always was a refreshingly different and wonderful story! I was hooked from the first glance between Avery and Kane and read this beautifully written book almost in one sitting. 
 Although I am not a fan of insta-love, the author handled the stunning attraction between Avery and Kane in a fantastic way in Always. Once these two met, there was no turning back. 
 ""Kane could feel his soul being extracted from his body. His heart followed, no longer his own, but given to this man he didn't even know. In a matter of a few short minutes, he had become one with this man in from of him."" 
 These two embark on a wonderful journey together and Ms. Alexander handles their lives with beauty and grace. Oh, and the sex scenes are absolutely some of the steamiest I have ever read. These two have a chemistry that jumps right off the page! I needed a cold shower after reading this book. I'll keep this review spoiler-free, because there are some major surprises that I did not see coming and this book should be read without knowing the plot twists. 
 Even if you are not a fan of the m/m contemporary romance genre, I highly recommend giving this book a try.

 Ridge slept with his brother's fiancee Mia, but they really never intended to hurt anyone. They really love each other but Ridge is consumed by guilt over his relationship with his brother, so he suddenly breaks up with Mia in an effort to repair his relationship with his brother. Ridge battled addictions most of his life, and breaking up with Mia sends him into a downward spiral. He had a very, very rough past, including drugs and spending time in juvenile detention, among other things. 
 Ridge has now become a successful restaurant owner but his pain over Mia pulls him into a very, very dark place. He tries to have other relationships but no one can compare to Mia. Even when he was a jerk to everyone, I loved him! He was never intentionally hurtful and really wanted to make things right. 
 Mia had every right not to care about Ridge, but even after he broke her heart, she really tries to do the right thing. I loved how she was a multi-dimensional character and seemed very ""real"" to me. 
 Oh, and the sex! It is HOT AS HELL . I mean, really dirty, scorching hot sex scenes. I applaud you Ms. Wild! I literally read this book in a few hours. It is the kind of book where you can't tear your eyes away from what is happening in front of you. If you like a down-and-dirty story with flawed characters, you will love Ridge.

 After Dark brings the fantastically addictive Night Owl trilogy to an incredibly satisfying conclusion. And what a finale it is! We are now witness to the somewhat ""normal"" living arrangements of Matt and Hannah as they return to real life after the tumultuous events of the first two books. Their relationship continues to be beautifully sexy, erotic and passionate. Make no mistake, After Dark is incredibly hot, dirty and lusty. Matt is irresistible! If not very maddening. 
 ""...little secrets are like water, but if water gets into a rock and freezes, it can break the rock."" 
 Hannah and Matt both struggle in After Dark to reach a level of closeness and honesty that is sometimes brutal to witness yet real, honest and emotional. I love how both Matt and Hannah have grown and matured over the course of the trilogy, without one false note. The plot in the final book is refreshing and a complete page-turner. I will admit that I am distraught that this trilogy has ended (one of my all-time favorites, hands down), but I was absolutely entranced by the conclusion and the Epilogue. After Dark is a moody, erotic, sensual story that is a must-read book. Fingers crossed for many more books from the extraordinarily talented M. Pierce!

 I love picking up a book and being totally surprised and enthralled by a new author. I could not put down Besieged once I started. It is uber-sexy, scorchingly hot, but with a fantastic story that kept my attention until the last page and left me dying for more from this author! Warning: the build up to these two having sex is just as hot as when they actually get together and this book requires a cold shower or two! My favorite kind of book! 
 Theo is a wealthy London businessman and Lilly works for his solicitor (lawyer in the U.S.). She's smart, sarcastic, funny and drop-dead sexy. Alhtough this might sound a tad familiar, the author really does a great job with Lilly and Theo's story as well as with making the city of London a character in the book. I absolutely loved the club scenes as well as the well-written supporting cast of family and friends. 
 Lilly and Theo have some F***-HOT scenes and they literally cannot keep their hands off each other. Theo is a confirmed bachelor, he has never even wanted to spend any time at all with a woman, let alone commit to anyone. Lilly only uses guys for sex, so they enter into a no-strings-attached sexual relationship. But Lilly makes Theo fight for her at first, she's stubborn, feisty and also very funny. 
 She's no pushover and is painfully aware of his player status. 
 Theo can't resist Lilly and what I loved about him is that he is totally honest with her. When he begins to develop real feelings for her, he puts himself on the line and does not play games. 
 Never have I gone to such lengths over a woman. I'm having to convince her that she wants me for god's sake. I close my eyes and I can hear her moaning as I taste that sweet pussy of hers. Her cries as she trembles against my tongue. Oh god. My cock stiffens immediately at the memory. 
 I realise that now I know what it is to have her...I can't go back. I will fight for her, no matter what. 
 All in all, I highly recommend this fantastic, sexy debut by L.P. Lovell. It's modern, totally hot and has characters that I really care about and who I really bonded with. The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star read for me was the pacing and editing which will probably go unnoticed by most readers but interrupted the flow for me. I was thrilled to read that this author will be paying closer attention next time and I absolutely cannot wait for the next book in this series. Grab Besieged, let it take you on a sexy trip to London, and enjoy!

 Leave it to Abbi Glines to give us yet another absolutely irresistible, surprisingly thoughtful leading man in Grant. The sweet and beautiful Harlow didn't have a chance with Grant around. I loved getting inside Grant's head to learn what his possible motivations could be in sleeping with Nan. And the alternating POV's work perfectly in this story. 
 Abbi Glines knows how to write some hot and dirty scenes and that's exactly what you get in Take A Chance. Along with the dramatic twists and turns (especially near the end), and the very alluring characters, I could not put this book down. I absolutely cannot wait for more Grant and Harlow!!

The story of how Kate blossoms once she arrives in Napa Valley for her latest assignment had me hooked and I read this fabulous book almost in one sitting. The chemistry between Kate and Jamie was real and relatable to me and I fell in love with the California and Chicago settings of this story. 
 Kate is in a ho-hum relationship with a boyfriend who really doesn't even pay that much attention to her. and decides to leap at the chance to interview a reclusive tech millionaire at his winery in Napa Valley. She has learned to rely on only herself, which is kind of poignant and sad. 
 ""I'm all I've got."" 
 Jamie is one of the winery workers and let's just say he brings Kate out of her shell. 
 ""Food is like love,you know?"" 
 ""Yes,"" I said breathlessly. 
 ""We need it to stay alive."" 
 There is so much more to this story, and it is a richly written, lovely romance that left me wanting more! There are spoilers to this story, and no, I didn't see them coming, unlike other readers. I absolutely loved the characters and the story took my breathe away. Nowhere but Here is a must-read for lovers of a solid story, contemporary romance and a swoony leading man!

 Mia is almost left at the altar (her fiancee calls off the wedding a week before by text message) and she is completely depressed, especially since she is an event planner and used to making detailed, well-thought-out lists for EVERYTHING (even down to the outfits she is going to wear each day). 
 ""Top Five Reasons (Out of 100) I Am NEVER Coming Out Of This Blanket Fort"" 
 Mia is not a spontaneous person at all but ends up traveling alone to Paris on what would have been her honeymoon. What sounds like it might be a cliche story turns out to be SO much more as she meets a scruffy bartender, Lucas, who makes a bet with her that leads to them sightseeing together all over the city. 
 This is a very, very funny book and is told from Mia's POV. It is a total escapist story and I absolutely loved every minute of it. Lucas is smart, kind, sensitive and not at all like the type of man Mia thought she would be attracted to. He breaks all the molds but he, too, has some hang-ups of his own. 
 Their chemistry is AMAZING, and I wanted more, more, more!! This is a standalone book but I will say that I really would like to read more of Lucas and Mia's story. There is also a wonderful supporting cast of characters so maybe we will read more about them in the future? (Hint, hint!) 
 This is a perfect, sexy little gem of a book. I highly recommend it.

This book will draw you right in from the very powerful prologue right through to the very end. Kylie and Cooper are a young married couple who have suffered an almost unimaginable loss. Unfortunately, their mutual grief almost leads to their complete self-destruction as a couple. 
 At first I could not understand why they continued to torture each other but the author writes in such a way that I fell in love with both characters and with their mutual best friend Grayson. These are not perfect people and they make lots of mistakes along the way. At a few points, I almost could not stand the way Cooper and Kylie treated each other -- but then the author gives us flashbacks so you can't help but understand and even sympathize why they are so shattered, but yet so joined together 
 ""We share a reckless, toxic love that feeds the brokenness in me, in us. Our love is an addiction. A love that I won't ever consider living without."" 
 Against All Odds is an outstanding debut novel from Angie McKeon. There are plenty of steamy sexy times but also tons of emotion and a really creative story that makes this book stand out from the crowd of contemporary romances. I have heard that the author has another book in the works and I can't wait to read it!

Blood Mate is a FAIRY TALE, not really an erotic romance in any way, and is another intense story from Kitty Thomas. I don't normally read this genre of books but I absolutely loved the writing and the characters and am so glad I had the opportunity to read this book. 
 August is a very powerful vampire who is cursed to forever take human victims on order to ensure his own survival. He was a good man in his former life and he desperately wants to break his curse. To do this, he must find his ""blood mate"", a woman whom he cannot ""enthrall"" or control via her mind, and who will stay with him throughout eternity. 
 August finds Nicole, who is actually very happily married. Through a series of twists and turns, August creates a situation where Nicole will become his blood mate, but she doesn't give in so easily, and is a very strong and feisty heroine. August is torn by his actions but he absolutely must ensure his own survival. 
 Only Kitty Thomas could create a cast of strong characters like those in Blood Lust and an fantastically creative story that will keep you guessing until the very end. 
 If you want to step outside your usual genre of books, I highly recommend this dark and sensual tale. You will not be disappointed.

 Therapy is an absolutely beautifully written book that explores very sensitive topics of depression, bullying, self-harming and addiction in an unflinching way, but without ever dragging the reader down or making the situations too unbearable. Jessica has a tormented life, but I was cheering for her and I loved the way the author really got inside this young girl's mind. Jace comes to her rescue, but he is certainly no cookie-cutter hero and battles demons of his own throughout the book. 
 The time span of this book is wide and it is a rich story filled with unforgettable characters. There are some major ""oh wow"" moments so I'll keep this review spoiler-free. Jessica is tormented relentlessly by bullies in high school. She battles depression and engages in self-harming (very graphically depicted) and makes some other very poor choices that will come back to haunt her later. Jace is the quintessential popular high school jock who befriends Jess and their friendship grows into a deep and lasting love. 
 But nothing is ever easy for Jess, so this is not a hearts-and-flowers love story between her and Jace. The author writes a wonderfully detailed story and it should be read without knowing the plot spoilers! This is a must-read book for its sensitivity, writing and creativity. I loved the story and can't wait to read more from Ms. Perez.

 As someone who reads a LOT of m/m books, I went into TAKE with some reluctance. I generally prefer male authors of m/m stories and I prefer the books to be graphic. I have read Ella Frank's books and she is a gifted and talented writer but I wasn't sure where she'd go with this genre. Well, she totally took me by surprise with Tate and Logan! I LOVED their story and highly recommend this series to anyone who appreciates lots of steam, an emotional story, and well-written, engaging characters. The story is wonderful and my heart broke a little for Tate as he struggled with coming out to his family.. 
 I absolutely loved Logan's confident, take-charge personality. He is very comfortable in his own skin. And the chemistry between these two is unmistakable. I recommend reading Try first - you can read Take as a standalone but the characters and story are more meaningful if you ""begin at the beginning"". I did find the main characters to be just a little chatty at some points, but Ms. Frank more than makes up for that with absolutely off-the-charts sex scenes that are incredibly erotic. This demanding m/m reader was more than satisfied. Have a cold shower ready, you will need it after reading Tate and Logan's story!

Her books always have such a sense of heart and family infused into the smexy-ness of the story that they truly are a treat to read. I absolutely loved City - could he be ANY hotter?? - and the object of his lust, the very endearing schoolteacher, Suzy (or Suzette, City likes to use her real name and not her nickname). Often I read erotic romance that is rushed, empty, almost soulless, and Throttle Me is the compete opposite: a steamy, tattooed hot guy who has had his share of meaningless hook-ups but who has a real sense of romance, love and family. 
 Tattooed, motorcycle-riding Alpha bad boy? Check. Smart, hard-working, sweet woman who is just getting her first taste of really mind-blowing sex? Check. Well-written cast of supporting characters? Check! (Hello, Gallo brothers!) There are no billionaires here, no young, blushing virgin. What I have always loved about Chelle's books are that the characters and everyday, working people, looking for love and having some super-hot sexy times along the way.

 This is a stunning tale of mental illness, love, adolescent angst, sexuality, revenge and finally, self-acceptance. Laney is the voice of the story and she is not the most lovable of characters. Yes, her tale is sad and depressing at first but ultimately it is uplifting in a way that only Leah Raeder can make honest, real, believable and sympathetic all at once. 
 ""Tell me something."" He leaned closer, his voice raspy at the edges, charred. ""If you hate human connection so much, why come with us?"" Because I don't hate it. I hate how much I need it. Because you're the ones I was waiting for. Because you smell like prey."" 
 Unteachable is one of my favorite books so I could not wait to read BLACK IRIS. And Leah Raeder has written another powerful and brilliant story that will keep you guessing until the very end. It is not told in chronological order, which adds to the element of disorientation present throughout the book. Her writing style is beautiful, seductive and addicting, a world where wet eyelashes become black petals and a lowly puddle of water becomes a brilliant oil color painting. 
 The characters in this book are unforgettable and I felt as though I personally knew Delaney, Blythe, Armin, Donnie and Hiyam. The writer is wise beyond her years and her glimpses into married life are brutally honest and painful and will haunt me for a long time to come. The plot is incredibly imaginative and meaningful and is not all hearts and flowers. If you are looking for a thrilling, suspenseful book with a powerful message and perfect writing, then read BLACK IRIS. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is truly a one-of-kind story from an author with a very unique voice.

Our hero Jack is a classic alpha male, in fact, he's the town sheriff and basically falls for Jenn immediately and claims her as his own. He is very sexy and I loved his no-nonsense, blunt, plain-speaking character. 
 ""I'm not 9-5 suit material; I wear jeans; I hunt bad guys, and I rescue damsels in distress."" 
 Jenn has had several major upheavals in her life and ends up relocating to the town of Gunnison in the Colorado mountains. I liked that our heroine is not 22 years old but instead is old enough to have a daughter in college. Much action and drama ensue once Jenn arrive in town, and the best part for me was the romance and the very, very hot and steamy sex scenes between Jenn and Jack. There is also a crime/mystery story involved which puts Jenn in peril throughout much of the book. 
 There is no question that this book is cut from the same mold as Kristen Ashley's stories. The author clearly and admittedly is a fan of KA. If you like a growling alpha male with a good heart and a feisty heroine, you will love this book.

The writing style is very different and fresh, written mostly in the form of diary entries. Emma is a smart and ambitious corporate employee and becomes personal assistant to the imposing Alaric Canon, who has burned through so many PA's that he is the subject of office betting pools. The jerk-y boss/subservient assistant has been done before, but never like this! Emma has a plan to get Alaric to notice her but he is perpetually challenging and sets standards that are basically impossible for his assistants to meet. Emma's inner monologue is hilarious, as she deals with his demanding and dominating personality: 
 ""Life's a bitch, and she has several sisters."" 
 This girl has a plan to get Alaric to notice her, but her best-laid plans go wildly awry when the two take a tension-filled business trip and basically spend 24/7 together. Emma rises to Alaric's challenges time after time, and I absolutely loved the slow build-up to their incredible sexy times together: 
 ""Denim in long expanses. Barely contours to his thighs. Thighs I have leaned against but not touched. Bare feet. 
 Barefoot! Put some shoes on, already! How am I supposed to look unaffected and asexual 
 with all this unfair fuckery happening?"" 
 Emma is completely self-deprecating and really holds no illusions about the possibilities of a relationship with Alaric. I mean, he is rarely seen with the same woman twice. 
 ""God, I'm not in just in the neighborhood of pathetic, I'm circling the block."" 
 Alaric really grows and develops and begins to show a more human side and I loved that he was not just a one-dimensional character. My heart was literally in my throat by the end of the book. Qwen's writing style is incredibly fresh and unique and is a most welcome addition to the contemporary erotic romance genre. I adored the conclusion and I am demanding more from this author!

This book is written in a raw, take-no-prisoners style which is refreshing and different. This is not the usual damaged-hero-and-heroine story but instead is a real, gritty portrayal of two people who have endured suffering and abuse (graphically portrayed, so be warned) but who manage to come together and yes, fall in love. 
 Kace has what can only be described as severe social anxiety disorder and it's a miracle she even could hold a conversation with Shane, let alone let him love her. And Shane is surprisingly introspective, tender and loving, despite his sad background. 
 Undefeated contains what I thought to be very realistic and detailed fighting scenes which are really written in a different style than the fighter books I have previously read, I guess due to the author being male. The erotica in this book comes a little later in the story, but is super-steamy and sexy nonetheless. 
 If you are looking for a book that is written in a very raw style with very real people, then I recommend Undefeated. And please heed the author's warning about the violence, it's very, very graphic! And give his Baby series a try, you will love them.

I was completely fascinated from Page 1 with our heroine Vera, a whip-smart, unique, insecure beauty who marches to the beat of a different drummer. Thank you, Karina, for a heroine who's real, flawed, emotional and, in the end, very open to love. 
 This book transported me to Spain with its sexy and romantic story of Mateo and Vera, two mismatched lovers thrown together by chance. Vera is a young Canadian college student who takes a temporary summer job in Spain, to provide English-only conversation to Spanish attendees. Mateo is a handsome, married ex-footballer, well-known in Europe and older than Vera but quite discontent with his life. Their love builds slowly, beautifully, painfully and with tons and tons of off-the-charts chemistry. 
 While in Spain, Vera learns to slow down, appreciate life and be in the moment. The scenes between her and Mateo are absolutely breathtaking and almost painfully beautiful. He sees her inner and outer beauty, and in his eyes, she is a bright and shining star. His ""Estrella"". 
 ""Design your own universe, make your own stars, write your own stories and create your own destiny."" 
 This is not a book where the decisions of the hero and heroine are made lightly or without thought to the consequences. I really felt Mateo's agony as he struggled to do the right thing but to also follow his heart and live his life to the fullest. Love, in English is ultimately a beautifully written journey of two very different people who fall madly in love. If you care about such things, this is a standalone book but you will be sad for it to end! I leave you with my favorite quote from Love, in English, and the unqualified recommendation that you read this book. You will love it! 
 ""What is love? In English."" 
 I raised my brows. ""Love, in English, is love..."" 
 ""What is it in Spanish? 
 I was so enthralled by his hypnotic eyes, I could barely remember. ""Amore?"" 
 He shook his head ever so slightly. ""No. Love in Spanish is you.""",Tue Jan 07 23:05:24 -0800 2014,Fri Jun 06 14:08:11 -0700 2014,Sun Apr 13 00:00:00 -0700 2014,Fri Apr 11 00:00:00 -0700 2014,9,2

I believe that there is a 30-page long sex scene! Give or take a few pages. This is part of the Wicked Lovers series but it really can be read as a standalone. The characters are believable, the guys are HOT, and the story is incredibly engrossing. This is one of those books where the title really says it all. 
 I LOVE menage books and Shayla Black has written one of the most memorable menage stories I have ever read. With the fantastic D/s elements, this is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it. Nothing is rushed and I felt an emotional connection with the characters. I loved everything about this book! Shayla Black has become one of my go-to authors for erotic romance. I am usually not a fan of suspense elements in my romance books but I loved this story and highly recommend this book.

The characters, the setting, the story, the EMOTIONS, this book had everything I love about a great book. Mia Sheridan is a gifted and talented storyteller and Archer's Voice is at the top of my all-time favorite books. I absolutely fell in love with Archer, he has suffered unimaginable trauma and is closed off from the world. Along comes Bree and awakens his long-dormant feelings and his abilities to possibly become a whole person again. Archer is an intense, sometimes difficult character and my heart broke for him. Don't wait, Archer's Voice is a must-read!!

I absolutely love the tattooed and pierced Hayden and Tenley very much grew on me by the end of this story. 
 I have not yet read the prequel novella, Cupcakes & Ink, but I will now run to read it. I will admit that the first part of this book was a ""slow burn"" for me, there was no rushing into romance but instead Ms. Hunting slowly reveals the badly damaged souls of Hayden and Tenley. But then WOW, the author writes some amazingly hot sex scenes, which are very much infused with love and caring and an emotional connection between the characters. Hayden and Tenley both have secrets they are afraid to share with each other, even though it becomes clear they are falling in love. 
 Hayden is seriously hot and really tries to show his vulnerable side to Tenley. But she is both emotionally and physically scarred and keeps pushing him away. 
 ""Everyone has scars, Tenley. If we're lucky, they're only on the outside."" Hayden 
 I ended up falling in love with both these characters by the end and I can't wait for the next book in this series! Inked Armour will be released May 13th so I can get more of my Hayden fix.

I am a huge fan of Pepper Winters and Destroyed lived up to every expectation I had, plus some. I did not read any reviews of this book before I started reading it and I am so glad I had no idea about this story other than the synopsis, so I will keep this spoiler-free. Pepper has created two of the most memorable characters I have ever read and even now I can't stop thinking about Hazel and Fox. 
 This is a dark, dark journey, but hold out and keep reading because the author makes it worth your while. Our hero and heroine meet under very harsh circumstances and their story is a raw, gritty and emotional journey like no other. Yes, the sex scenes are incredibly steamy, but they are infused with a rawness and pain that is at times difficult to witness: 
 ""It was the best kiss I'd ever received, but also the worst. It sparked lust and need in every inch of me. My lips wanted more, my tongue wanted savagery. My skin wanted to bruise because he needed to touch me so badly. 
 All my thoughts disappeared as I nipped at his bottom lip. He flinched, but a second later he copied, his sharp canines piercing my oversensitive flesh. 
 I moaned. 
 I couldn't take it. 
 My hands flew up and gripped his shirt. Yanking him toward me, fireworks whizzed in my fingertips; my heart galloped toward exploding with lust. I'd never been so drunk on someone before. 
 Then I landed flat on my back. 
 The crack of my skull jangled my teeth. The thick carpet did little to cushion me. My eyes flared wide and I grunted in pain. Fear, hot and terrible, swamped my lust in a dampening wave. 
 ""Top rule. Unbreakable rule. Don't. Ever. Touch. Me."" Fox kneeled on one knee beside my head, breathing hard. His hand noosed my throat, pressing my spine into the carpet. His eyes were cold and lifeless, looking like a hunter intent on blood."" - HAZEL 
 My heart went out to both of them and especially Fox, he was a fighter, hiding his fractured soul behind a stony, murderous facade: 
 ""Fox made a sound in the back of his throat, tightening his fingers. He glared, looking ready to murder me. ""Who are you?"" His eyes darted over me as if looking for an answer. 
 When I didn't respond, he swiped his face with his other hand. His forehead furrowed while his expression turned pissed and stormy. ""You think I didn't see you watching? You had your eyes all over me. Answer me. Who the fuck are you?"" His deep, accented voice stiffened my nipples even as a thrill of fear jolted through me. 
 My temper gave me false courage. ""I'm not in the habit of answering such rude questions."" -- HAZEL 
 I absolutely loved the dual POV's, which are very difficult to do well, but Pepper does an amazing job at getting the reader into these character's heads. Destroyed was an absolute 5-star read for me. I do hope, however, that the small editing and grammatical will be corrected. Otherwise, Destroyed is another fantastic and completely original story from the very talented Pepper Winters.

Joss is trying to move on with her life after the sudden death if her beloved husband. Little does she know that his best friend Dash has always been in love with her but never acted on his feelings out of loyalty to his best friend and Joss' husband. Sparks literally fly when she walks into Dash's D/s club one night, and he realizes she is looking to be in a submissive relationship. He is shocked but thrilled at the possibility of a relationship with her. 
 Maya Banks can write hot and steamy sex scenes like nobody's business! Wowser! What was beautiful about the story is that Dash and Joss had a deep connection before they have sex and there is a slow and gradual build-up to their scenes together. I loved when Joss really ""saw"" Dash for the first time as a man and a sexual partner, instead of the best friend of her husband. It was breathtaking. 
 The sex scenes are totally hot and the anal play scenes are absolutely among the hottest I have ever read! There is a fabulous Epilogue and no cliffhanger, but there will definitely be more books in this series about Joss and Dash's friends. Can't wait for more from Maya Banks!

Yes, there is, in a way. The story of Lilith and her rise to become the powerful and influential head of a high-class call-girl operation is tragic at times and always gripping. Her mother trains her in the ways of the lifestyle, and Vivian will certainly not win any Mother of the Year awards. But she is sure of a woman's power and never lets her daughter forget it. 
 This story spans several decades and is filled with some of the most intense sexual scenes I have ever read. Menage, light BDSM, young girls experiencing their first sexual awakenings, this book has it all. All of the characters spanning the years are fascinating, and the Miami drug scene in the eighties and nineties provides a dangerous backdrop to the main story. 
 M. Robinson has an interesting way of writing where she takes you literally through the life and the mind of the main characters. It is a layered and very rich story, and not exactly for the faint of heart. Ms. Robinson is extremely talented and certainly can bring on the angst! Just please note that this book contains some very graphic erotic scenes and if that is your cup of tea, then you will love The Madam.

Ream is explosive and sexy, but he is harboring some terrible secrets that cause him to turn off emotionally and push Kat away. Kat herself is keeping a huge secret from Ream and the book turns on some major misunderstandings between the two of them. 
 The band is back home after being on tour and Ream aggressively pursues Kat. She can't deny his larger-than-lfe personality and his aggressive alpha tendencies. I loved this sexy, hot rocker but much of the story is spent with Kat denying her true feelings for him. I absolutely loved the two of them together, and they have incredibly explosive chemistry. 
 The story felt a little rushed toward the end, with several plot threads coming together and very crucial characters all appearing at the end of the story. I love dark reads but the darker elements felt a little forced, and I would have loved a little more background on some of the characters that shaped Ream's life. The best parts of the story were when Ream opened up emotionally about his past, I really felt connected to him and Kat during those moments in the story. My heart broke for Ream and what he endured in his past and I loved how he overcame these horrible obstacles so that he could be what Kat needed. 
 I loved all of the friends and bandmates and look forward to reading about Georgie and Deck. Nashoda Rose can write seem sizzling hot scenes and I look forward to reading more of her books!

The story is told from multiple POVs which can be a little disorienting but which does give insight into the three main guy characters. I loved the chemistry between Nixon and Trace but I needed more romance! Their scenes together were sizzling but not explicit. This book explores the inner workings of mafia families and if you like mob stories, then you will love that part of the plot. There are a lot of secondary characters here, as well as lots of betrayals and violence...in short, a good look into the uncertain and tough world of crime families. 
 I am interested to see where Chase's story goes and hope there will be more written about him! I loved his scenes with Trace. Rachel Van Dyken is an excellent writer and there is never a dull moment with this story. Overall, I thought a Elect was a fast-paced read, with well-developed characters and lots of surprising plot twists.

Evan is a shell of a man, he thinks he's unloveable and he suffers terribly from painful memories of his past. Lia might be his savior and he will do anything to protect her. The storyline is incredibly creative, and the steam factor is off the charts! 
 This is a real page-turner, a true romantic suspense story. There are some memorable (and dangerous) characters here and Ms. Savage kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading this book. I loved the completely unpredictable plot and absolutely loved the chemistry between Evan and Lia! I highly recommend this book and series when you crave some major suspense and need a departure from a hearts-and-flowers story. Evan is an amazing character, and the writing is top-notch.

Human trafficking, drugs, kidnapping, abuse in all forms - this story contains all of this and more. But it is also an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling book if you can make it through the very difficult parts of Tess and Q's story. 
 Reading the fantastic Tears of Tess first is a must so that you can fully understand the dark and complex nature of the main characters' relationship. I had been waiting for Pepper Winers to continue Tess and Q's story and I devoured Quintessentially Q almost in one sitting. This is a highly addictive series and the writing is lush, detailed and very, very sexy. I mean, Q almost literally burns up the pages.

 The publisher very graciously sent me a copy of this gorgeous book to review. From the minute I opened this book, I remembered why I LOVE Travis Maddox so much. This story brought me back to those treasured times when I would get lost in a book! A Beautiful Wedding answers all the questions you might have about the circumstances surrounding Travis and Abby's wedding. It is funny, it is tender, it is swoon-worthy and yes, I cried several times during the story! 
 Jamie McGuire is such a great writer that I immediately re-connected with these characters and was drawn right back into their story. This novella can definitely be read in one sitting but I kind of wanted to draw it out because I love Travis so much. This fantastic story is a must-read for all fans of the Beautiful Disaster series!

The story begins right after Found in You ends and launches right into more delicious romance and intense chemistry between Alayna and Hudson. I loved this attentive and romantic side of Hudson! 
 ""No. This is better than a beginning. This is what happens next."" - Hudson 
 There are still lots of external forces conspiring to drive a wedge between these new lovers' relationship. PLus, Alayna has her own demons to deal with which make her behaviour at times vert maddening! This book inspired a lot of emotion in me and I was really worried that she would be the one to drive the two of them apart: 
 ""He'd told me once that he would always be manioulative and domineering, even when he wasn't playing games. It was who he was. Me, I would always be obssessive. I'd always question. Even when I was healthy. Asking to forget about this was defying my nature."" - Alayna 
 Hudson does all that he can possibly do under the circumstances to persuade Laynie that his feelings for her are genuine and real. But her obsessive nature bubbles to the surface on more than one occassion. 
 Hudson also seems to be keeping something from Laynie despite their promises to be completely honest and open with each other. There is a very compelling storyline here that is very creative and emotional. At times, I feared that Hudson's behavior, not Laynie's, would destroy their relationship. I don't want to give any spoilers away but rest assured that this book is packed with some totally HOT sex scenes and a fantastic storyline. It is a fabulous conclusion to the series! I highyl recommend this yummy trilogy and I hope there will be more written about these characters in the future.

Even though I am addicted to reading, sometimes I get a little jaded...And then a book like Tangled comes along, and BAM! Just like that, I'm addicted to reading again. Seriously, a book that cites Braveheart, the Borg, an NYU sex study and frogs? I'm in. 
 Tangled is one of the most original books I have ever read. Told from the main male character Drew's POV, the very talented author gives the reader a peek into how guys really feel and think: 
 ""Every healthy man in the world wakes up with a stiffy. A fatty. Morning wood. I'm sure there's some medical explanation for the phenomenon, but I just like to think of it as a little present from God."" 
 Drew is insanely attractive, smart, hard-working and very wealthy. Sounds cliche, right? In the hands of this talented author, Drew is one of the most memorable and original characters I have ever encountered! I love Drew's inner monologues. They are both hysterically funny and very, very touching. He's a self-confessed womanizer who meets his match in the very smart and gorgeous Kate Brooks. He falls hard for Kate and all his old rules about women and dating fly out the window. 
 ""Women fall in love quicker than men. Easier and more often. But when guys fall? We go down harder. And when things go bad? When it's not us who ends it? We don't get to walk away. 
 We crawl. "" 
 The author has described the genre of Tangled as ""Comedic Erotica"" and ""Funny Smut."" Both phrases describe this book to a tee. It is both hilarious and very, very intense. I started reading this book past midnight and did not want to put it down. Seriously, it's that addictive. Don't waste time reading this review. Start reading Tangled. You will absolutely fall in love with Drew!

They both have suffered terribly, in different ways. Crystal is a waitress at a strip club, paying off an old debt while taking care of her special needs sister. Shane is a protective former Special Forces Officer who is intrigued by Crystal and wants nothing more than to take care of her. 
 These two are dealing with some very tough circumstances, to put it mildly. There is a pretty detailed backstory in Hard As It Gets that might be helpful to read before Shane and Crystal's book to give you a sense of the characters and their relationship to each other. I absolutely loved the sexy scenes between Shane and Crystal and the twists and turns that Laura Kaye does so well.

 I love to read and I read a ton of books. Among all the books I have read, Night Owl is one of my top favorite books of all time. I could not wait to get my hands on Last Light. And let me just say that M. Pierce delivered big-time with this book. 
 Matt Sky makes my heart hurt. I have not stopped thinking about him since I finished reading Last Light. Wait, what? He's a fictional character? That's okay. I'm still obsessed with him. 
 Last Light picks up as Matt has faked his own death, and retreated to a life of solitude in the woods. He simply cannot bear the attention and acclaim that came with being a famous author. He has convinced Hannah to play along with his ruse, much to her growing dismay. Poor, beleagured Hannah is forced into the charade as she attends Matt's memorial and is faced with lying to his family and an ever-growing web of deceit. And hello, Sky brothers! In Last Light, we get to know uber-sexy, bad-boy Seth, who I hope and pray will get his own story soon. Seth is absolutely irresistable. But I digress. Matt made me very uncomfortable with his growing deception, and his relationship with a new character named Melanie. If she was supposed to be a sympathetic character, I'm not buying it. I hated her!! 
 I don't want to give away any plot spoilers so I will just say that I am in love with this series and with this author. The sense of melancholy that pervades this book is completely haunting, but is perfectly balanced with humor and some of the hottest sex scenes you will EVER read. Did I mention that M. Pierce is a brilliant writer? I haven't stopped thinking about this book since I finished and I might have to go back in for a re-read. The cast of characters from this series are unforgettable. I cannot wait for After Dark!

The publisher was kind enough to send me a paperback and it is stunning. Now, on to the novel. I absolutely loved this very suspenseful and totally HOT story of Becca and Nick and the introduction into the Hard Ink world. Becca is frantically searching for her missing brother, and her search leads her to Nicholas Bixey and Hard Ink, the tattoo parlor he co-owns with his brother. Nick resists her at first but then is drawn into helping her, due to the deep ties he had with her military father and because he is completely attracted to her. The action begins and doesn't let up until the last page. There are some loose ends left (NOT a cliffhanger though!) and I can't wait to see where the author takes us with the underlying mystery. 
 One of the reasons why I loved this romantic suspense story is because the relationship between Becca and Nick builds nicely and is very believable. Yes, their chemistry is off the charts but they both treat each other with respect and Becca could have been a pushover but she's actually a very strong character. 
 Hard As It Gets is a tough, sexy, action-filled mystery filled with well-written, fantastic characters. I'm eager to read more about each and every one. Nick is one hot Alpha male and I loved the VERY steamy sexy times between Nick and Becca. Wowza! Ms. Kaye really knows how to turn up the heat! This was my very first Laura Kaye novel and I'm hooked! I'm looking forward to reading more books in this series.

 To say that I was ecstatic to read this book is an understatement. 
 The Raven has everything I love about Sylvain Reynard's writing and more. Lyrical, erotic, sensual and mysterious, The Raven begins another addictive series with the introduction of Raven and the Prince. This book is a must-read!! 
 Professor Emerson and his wife do appear here, but Raven and the Prince are themselves insanely fascinating. Even if you are not a huge fan of paranormal stories, this book is a must read for the thrilling story and lush, intensely sexual scenes. We are introduced to the Prince, leader of the City of Florence, who is at once cold and calculating but beautiful in his own right. He cannot stay away from Raven and feels compelled to help her again and again. He sees in her virtue and goodness, and she awakens long-dormant feelings that he never believed he could have, even at his own peril. 
 ""I'm afraid that trouble is not what you do. Trouble is what you are."" 
 Raven is an unlikely heroine and I fell in love with her! She is damaged goods, inside and out, and her painful history is hinted at and then ultimately explained. She is an extremely sympathetic character and I cannot wait to read more about her in the next book. The Prince, too, is surprised at his attraction to her; might she lead him to redemption and true love? 
 ""In many ways, we are the most perfect match. We see each other as we are, but neither of us views the other as broken."" 
 I am not articulate enough to adequately describe the virtues of this book! Part art history lesson, part paranormal romance, part erotica, it is a must read for all fans of Gabriel's Inferno - and even for those readers new to the series. This book can be read as a standalone but is best understood after having read the GI series. The Raven is engrossing, suspenseful, sexy and and yes, humorous. Do not miss this book! And while it has a a fabulous conclusion, there is much, much more to come for these characters and I cannot wait for more!!

Lorrie has been (understandably) struggling with the tragic deaths of both parents. She has returned to college after taking time off and feels overwhelmed by her life. She is almost literally thrown right into the arms of the incredibly hot Hunter ""The Hammer"" Jensen, a fellow college student who also happens to be a sexy MMA fighter. Lorrie finally feels a little emotion, but refuses to let herself become romantically involved with Hunter. 
 I really loved Hunter. He is sexy, incredibly sweet to Lorrie, and doesn't give up when Lorrie tries to keep him at arm's length. There's a slow build up to their relationship, but when they get together, BAM! The floodgates really open up, so to speak! The author really knows how to write incredibly steamy sex scenes, and Hunter and Lorrie are totally HOT together. 
 There were parts of this story that I became frustrated with Lorrie. I mean, this gorgeous and really caring guy wanted to be more than friends but she kept pushing him away. It then becomes clear that Hunter also has a wounded soul and is maybe hiding a secret or two of his own. 
 I really enjoyed this book. What started off as a typical college story turned into something more for me. I liked the creative plot and the emotion between Lorrie and Hunter. This book ends on a very suprising note and I can't wait to read more of Lorrie and Hunter's story!

As a fan of the m/m genre, I found the story to be very gripping and very satisfying in terms of the heat factor. I read a fair amount of m/m books and I generally find female authors to be a bit less gritty, but I will say the sex scenes in Saving Alexander did not disappoint! The heartbreaking description of Alex's background, from which he tries to find some sort of healing through BDSM sessions, is balanced out nicely by the loving relationship he finds with Sage. There is a suspenseful storyline here along with the very erotic romance between Sage and Alex. The only minor drawback for me was that these two talked A LOT about their relationship and their feelings. But overall I really liked this book and found it to be incredibly well written and enjoyable! Definitely a must-read for any fan of m/m books.

The author has created very passionate and complex characters that I related to from the first page. And the steam factor is perfect!

I picked up Jake Undone and was immediately drawn into the story, without knowing too much about the author or the characters. I recommend reading Gemini first but I don't think it's 100% necessary. Jake and Nina captivated me from the the first page. They begin in the friend zone as roommates but it's clear there is so much more to Jake than he is revealing to Nina. He is hot, tatted, passionate, and surprise, an engineer! Nina is beautiful but filled with phobias which Jake helps her overcome. 
 These two have amazing chemistry, and the story is totally captivating! This book was a complete surprise. Jake and Nina's sexy times are absolutely incredible. The story has two major plot twists (yes, two!) which completely took me by surprise. The author has created a very memorable book boyfriend in Jake. And the dual POV's are perfect.

A very grown-up sequel to the first book in this series, Disclosure of the Heart is a wonderful story about second-chance love. Nicki works in the White House, traveling with the President and in a seemingly passionate relationship with Juan Carlos. Along comes Adam, now a BBC reporter who now has a long-term girlfriend. Nicki can't forget her first love Adam but a relationship between them now would violate lots of rules, both personal and professional. There is lots of back-and-forth between Adam and Nicki and although at times, I wanted their relationship to speed up a bit, it was actually very realistic. I was pleasantly surprised at the steam factor in this book! I loved it! Mary Whitney obviously did her research here on the politics of working in the White House. This is a very smart, sexy, adult book, and is a great conclusion to Adam and Nicki's story!

 If I could give this book 10 stars, I would. Fighting Redemption belongs on everyone's must-read list. The writing is perfection, the story is emotional, sexy, funny, beautiful and thrilling, and the characters will stay with you long after you finish the words on the page. 
 Kate McCarthy has created a memorable novel that is filled with so much emotion, loyalty and love, that I don't even know how I can do justice to her written words. I absolutely fell in love with Jake, Ryan and Fin and was rooting for all of them from the first page! Ryan had very painful childhood and grows up desperate to leave his small town far behind. He has a burning desire to join the military and no one, not even the beautiful and sweet Fin, can change his course. He loves her deeply but feels that he must let her move on with her life because the military will always come first for him. 
 ""He shouldn't still be feeling this way after so many years. Why was he doing this to her, and to himself? It was better for everyone if he stayed away like he was supposed to."" 
 Fin, too, tries to move on but is drawn to Ryan and can't let go. 
 ""She took a step closer and he breathed her in, her scent like jasmine on a hot summer's day. He was surprised when he looked into her eyes and saw anger burning hotly in their depths."" 
 The book perfectly outlines their struggles to love, overcome loss, and be real and honest with one another. 
 ""Why can't I force myself to leave?"" He rested his forehead against hers and closed his eyes. ""I hurt too. For six years I fought every day not to think of you, and I lost, because every day you were all I could see. You were the best thing in my life--so sweet and innocent, and so goddamn tempting."" His hand strayed from her hip and slid down to grip her ass. He swallowed the groan. ""I stayed away so you could move on."" 
 This is easily one of my top books of 2013 and it is a must-read!! Fighting Redemption is the perfect mix of Alpha heroes, emotion, sexy times, a great story and extremely well-written characters. There are also several great twists to the story which will keep you on your toes. Kate McCarthy is an extremely gifted writer and I can't wait for more stories from her.

 Secrets are revealed, lots of action and romance ensue, and I couldn't put this book down, I read it in one sitting. I really cared about Aesa and Decker and felt emotionally connected to them.

Wrenn is very mature for an 18 year old and Dalton is only a few years older, just out of college. Added to that is the fact that he is teaching at her school on a temporary assignment, filling in for a teacher on maternity leave. 
 Their attraction builds, and their scenes together are very satisfying and super-steamy. This story is perfect for when you need a sexy, fairly quick read that is a standalone with no cliffhanger. I didn't feel too much of a taboo feeling towards their relationship, but I was on pins and needles waiting for the other shoe to drop.

 Jace and Colt (love the name) have been admiring each other from afar for years. Jace is openly gay but Colt is closeted. This book literally hits the ground running, and doesn't let up until the end. I was hooked right away and loved every minute of this very beautiful, sexy and dramatic story. And let me tell you, this story is HOT!! 
 When Colt and Jace first get together, there are almost fireworks exploding! 
 ""Let me tell you what I am sure of, what I want. I want you to fuck me tonight. I want you inside me. It's my first time, but I know I liked your finger in my ass when we made out in the locker room. How do you feel about that?"" 
 I loved Jace, he is kind and loving and only wants the best for Colt. He could have pushed Colt to come out of the closet but he didn't. He is loving and protective, even though he gets hurt by Colt's actions. These characters tragically spend years apart, and during that time, I also felt huge sympathy for Colt. Living his life as a lie brings him nothing but pain and heartache. But he courageously makes a lot of changes and as part of that, he goes after the love of his life, Jace. 
 ""No, I just need a minute, that's all. I've thought about this night for a long time. I want this, and I want it with you."" Colt kissed Jace's lips, a smile spread across his face. ""I plan on doing this often. Just be gentle with me, or not. Whatever."" And with that, Colt gave a devilish smirk, winked, and turned on his heel, not bothering to look back as he stepped inside the bathroom. 
 I loved the beautiful love story between Jace and Colt. It gets a but melodramatic at times but the love scenes are fantastic and I loved the whole storyline about being openly gay in the world of professional sports. I love a sexy M/M story with two male leads who are devoted to each other. Beware, this book is also filled with some pretty hateful characters! There are also some great supporting players. In particular, I am hopeful that Mitch will get his own story! This is my first book by Kindle Alexander and I can't wait to read more from her.

There is a little bit of a Colleen Hoover and Jamie McGuire vibe about this book, but it is also very adult on many levels, despite the college setting. 
 Amber, Brock and Ryder are all very complex characters and their histories makes it easy to understand and empathize with them as they plunge headlong into a steamy and passionate relationship. Amber especially has suffered terribly, but has pulled her life together (somewhat) by attending college in Maryland. 
 ""... (T)heir safety net came too late, unable to save me from my ancient habits. I continue to disconnect, self-destructing one man at a time, using sex as a brain detox. Sex is and will always be where I find control, a hidden shelter keeping me benign from the cancer that will forever disease the dark, frayed edges of my thoughts. Starting at the age of fourteen, I've abused, loved, craved, and hated sex in ways most people can't fathom. It'd rock their skulls. I've given it away without feeling a morsel of anything for the person on the receiving end and, many times, accepted it from those I knew couldn't stomach me."" 
 Amber is deeply attracted to both Brock and Ryder but Gail McHugh makes it very understandable how their feelings develop, even though Brock and Ryder are best friends: 
 ""Despite my friendship with Brock, Amber's worth a few rounds in the moral boxing ring."" 
 The plot was unexpectedly thrilling, and there was a rawness to this book that I did not expect. The characters were also unexpectedly sympathetic. I had a few minor drawbacks with the story but overall, I felt that Amber to Ashes was a very fresh and surprisingly sexy story that left me wanting more from this author!

 Remember When 2 takes place almost a decade after high school and everyone has gone their own way. Layla is a journalist and finds herself in a position to interview Trip, who has gone on to become a major Hollywood star. She has never forgotten Trip but assumes he has moved on with his life. In fact, she is engaged to a seemingly perfect guy. 
 ""Trip Wilmington had been a gorgeous teenaged boy, no question. But Trip Wiley was a gorgeous young man exuding raw, unabashed sex at every turn.""

Torrest has gifted us readers with a nostalgic, sweet, sexy and emotional story about two high schoolers trying to navigate the treacherous waters of first love. More than anything, Trip and Layla are great friends, but both are too young and perhaps inexperienced to move things forward in the romance department. 
 Trip has become one of my favorite book boyfriends. He is sweet, gorgeous, a little insecure and a little damaged. I absolutely devoured this nostalgic story about small-town life and loved all the swoon-worthy moments in this book. Trip is the new kid in school and Layla quickly befriends him. But she falls for him, and isn't sure of his feelings for her. The story takes place during senior year of high school so everyone is getting ready to go their own way, which adds to the overall poignant atmosphere of the story. 
 Remember When is a rich, funny, witty and beautiful look back at the feelings of our first true love. It is fast paced and filled with memorable characters. The final chapters of this book might contain one of my favorite scenes ever in a book. I am still thinking about it. I can't properly explain all the feelings that the author evoked in me while reading this book, but thank goodness I could start Book 2 immediately after finishing! I did not want to leave Trip and Layla and you won't either.

 I cannot get enough of Pam Godwin's books. Deliver is another deliciously dark and sexy book, which will sicken, stun, surprise and arouse you. 
 I could not put this book down. Forget what you think will happen in this book, because the author will totally surprise you with the characters and the plot. No one is all bad, and no one is all good. Yes, I even felt a little sympathy for Van, in all his f****d-up glory. Deliver is a perfectly written, dark thriller, with everything I love in a book: emotionally-connected characters, an incredibly twisted storyline, and scorching hot sex scenes. 
 Deliver is a must-read for fans of dark romance. I did not want this book to end, and I can't wait to read more from Ms. Godwin!!

 Cathy: I really liked this story about Jackson and Serenity! I felt sympathy for Serenity because of the situation she was forced into by Hogan, at the same time I was mad at her for doing what she was to the MC. I really loved Jackson. He's kind and helpful underneath the rough exterior. He really wants to help Serenity sort her shit out. It doesn't 
 hurt that that he is hot as hell and the sex is great. Knights' Sinner is a great, quick read. 
 Ellen: Once again, Bella delivers a super-hot, sexy story with characters you can sympathize with. I loved Serenity and the chemistry between Jackson and her is amazing. There are some super-steamy scenes between them, I loved Jackson because he is a little older and really knows what he wants. The age difference between Jackson and Serenity keeps things interesting. The story has just enough tension and drama to keep this a page-turner, there is some violence but the sex is HOT HOT HOT. And although I am sad that this is the last book in this series, Muff will be getting a novella!

This book wraps up the incredibly sexy, complicated and intense story between River, Dahlia and Ben that began in Connected. I could not imagine where these characters' story would end up after the shocker at the end of Connected, but Ms. Karr has given us an incredibly satisfying conclusion, along with a ton of emotion, sex, angst, betrayal and plot twists! 
 Dahlia and River's relationship is threatened by the shocking reappearance of Ben...River is jealous and angry...Dahlia is confused and insecure in her relationship with River...and Ben wants Dahlia back. River and Dahlia have a seemingly loving and beautiful relationship, but will their devotion to each other survive all the obstacles thrown in their path? Although I felt a little sorry for Ben throughout the story, I was thrilled at the conclusion to these characters' stories, and completely shocked by the very surprising revelations about several main characters near the end of the story. 
 There is lots of romance and sex in Torn, to balance out all the emotion and drama! I really love the author's writing style. Plus I was thrilled to learn that there will be more books in this series about characters from Connected and Torn.

I loved Adam and Mia. He is a tough-talking, Alpha cop and she is a beautiful redhead who doesn't take BS from anyone. I loved Adam and Mia's near-constant fighting almost as much as I loved their incredibly hot sex scenes. These two can't stay away from each other even though they drive each other crazy when they're together. The book is told in a series of alternating POV's which I loved. Adam and Mia married young, and suffered through an incredibly painful tragedy. A series of unfortunate misunderstandings leads to their breaking up, but they never stopped loving each other. At times during the story, I found Mia's behavior to be absolutely infuriating but I really grew to love her about half-way through the book! And Adam is amazing! All he wants to do is provide a home for Mia. He is a really good guy but he always says the wrong thing. 
 There is an exciting storyline and a very satisfying epilogue to Adam and Mia's story. Sometimes, you need a break from all the wealthy billionaire/innocent heroine love stories with a story about two very down-to-earth and relatable characters and this is the perfect antidote. I am going to read the first two books in this series and I am looking forward to more stories from this author!

Do not shy away from Good because of the student-teacher storyline! This book is filled with plenty of funny and witty moments to go along with the dramatic, emotional and very sexy scenes. The book is an emotional roller-coaster but the author wisely lightens up the drama with just enough light-hearted moments to make this one very enjoyable and read-in-one-sitting book. 
 Cadence is a high school student who made one pretty bad mistake one night. She is sent to juvenile detention, and when she returns to high school, she is horribly bullied and becomes a total outcast. Her parents are in complete denial about her situation at school, adding to her desperation and loneliness. The only bright spot (well, two, more about that in a minute) is her smart, kind and oh-so-sexy teacher, Mark Connelly. He recognizes the torture Cadence is suffering through at school and befriends her. He finds her beautiful, funny, smart and sensitive beneath the tough-girl attitude she tries to adopt at school. 
 The other bright spot in Cadence's life (and in the book) is her friend Avery, a sarcastic, funny and very smart girl who helps Cadence through some of her toughest moments. I loved Avery! And the teenage-girl banter between Cadence and Avery is hilarious, sad, dirty and sweet, all at the same time. 
 Back to Mr. Connelly. I loved him. The forbidden aspect of their relationship only made it more thrilling (and poignant) for me. Adding to the age difference, Cadence comes from a strict Christian home and she constantly battles with what she has been taught. Is she a bad person? No. Is Mark a bad person? Absolutely not! I absolutely loved both characters, loved reading about their internal struggles and loved their beautiful and tender love scenes together.

Faith Andrews drew me me into Mia's story from the very beginning, grabbed my heart, and didn't let go until the last page. To call this a second-chance love story doesn't really do this wonderful book justice. Mia and Declan married very young, had children right away and got caught up in the same problems many married couples face: he works very long hours, she feels under-appreciated and unattractive, he is a little resentful, their young children demand a lot of energy and attention, etc. etc. Declan is a gorgeous, sensitive, smart and loving husband but Mia always dreams about the ""what-ifs"" with her high school crush, Noah. 
 Is the grass always greener on the other side? You will have to read Man of My Dreams to find out. There are no bad people in this book! Mia, Declan and Noah are all good, loving characters who find themselves a little weighed down by the ordinary problems of life. The author has written some wonderful characters here, and I absolutely loved both Declan and Noah. I was thrilled at the conclusion of this book. I don't want to give any spoilers away because the author really kept me breathlessly guessing up until the very end where this story would go! 
 Man of My Dreams is a very well-written, touching and fast paced debut story and I am looking forward to more books from Ms. Andrews!

AJ is the Latino drummer that we met in Book One. The ladies fall all over him but he is searching for something more meaningful. A chance meeting with nurse Mia might be just the cure for him. We are treated to lots of hot sexy times with AJ and Mia but will she let down her guard and let him in to her heart? 
 Mia is introduced to AJ's rock musician lifestyle and wonders if she can deal with his crazy lifestyle, even though she really does begin to develop deep feelings for him. I love books with a dual POV so this was a big plus for me. I also liked the fact that Mia is pretty much an average working woman and yet AJ sees her as beautiful, desirable and sexy. 
 Beat of the Heart is a fairly light, erotic and well written book. Ms. Ashley's writing style flows well and I cared about the characters. If you want a break from a heavy, angsty book, then Beat of the Heart is for you. Enjoy!

She writes real new adult characters, who are not perfect by any means and who are all looking to find themselves a little bit. There are connected characters in Breaking Shaun, but you absolutely can read this book without having read Freeing Asia (although I totally recommend it because it's awesome) Breaking Shaun tells the story of Natalie and Shaun, Asia's brother. He is a hot and sexy, gorgeous surfer, a total manwhore who is unapologetic in his behavior but in his defense, completely honest and open with the girls that he sleeps with. Full disclosure. but it doesn't make for any less drama on the part of the girls he leaves behind. He is NOT interested in any kind of lasting relationship at all. 
 Shaun then meets his match in the smart and sexy Natalie. She has moved to town to get a fresh start and starts work as a bartender. She, too, doesn't believe in true love and uses guys for sex. Perfect match for Shaun, right? Natalie has her reasons for this behavior which we find out later in the story. 
 Shaun and Natalie's group of friends like to party so there is lots and lots of wild nights out drinking and smoking pot. Shaun and Natalie start off as good friends and move towards a deeper relationship when they have the most mind-blowing sex of their lives. And Ms. Abel can write some SOMKING hot sex scenes! What I loved about the sexy times is that they are actually infused with some pretty deep feelings, despite what Shaun and Natalie might say about wanting to remain unattached. 
 As Natalie asserts: 
 ""Women like me don't fall for men like you. We don't come when you call, we don't beg for your attention and we don't confuse sex with love. Women like me, break men like you"" 
 Natalie and Shaun really do build a solid, caring friendship, and they both try to make the other a better person. Natalie encourages Shaun to move forward with this surfboard designs and Shaun encourages her to return to school to pursue her passion, photography. I absolutely love the beach-y setting of Breaking Shaun and the glimpses into the world of surfing. This is another warm, very sexy, well-written story with lots of heart. There is lots of partying but there is also a great story and strong characters. I love this author and hope there will be more books in this series!

Freeing Asia was one of those books that started off in one place and then completely changed course and took me in a whole other direction. This was a completely refreshing and surprising book that is a total gem and a wonderful read. 
 It's hard to believe this is the first book by this author. 
 Asia grew up the only girl in a house full of boys, an artist who is afraid to explore her talent and be herself. While living her somewhat lonely life, she meets the gorgeous, sexy and wealthy Jay, which is where I thought, ""Uh oh, not this story line again."" Well, I was dead wrong! Freeing Asia is about so much more, it is about being yourself, not being afraid to love, and not changing to be what other people want you to be. 
 Jay is driven, smart, handsome, very kind and clearly smitten with Asia. And she with him: 
 ""He had the power to change me and turn me into anything he wanted me to be. And, in this moment, I was willing to be whatever he wanted."" 
 Asia had her heart broken by her first love, Marcus, who is still in her life as her brother's best friend. The author writes so many smexy scenes between Jay and Asia that I was really caught off-guard by where this story went. 
 ""Marcus had been my first. He'd known the real me, and there had been something between us that I could never explain."" 
 I don't want to go into much detail about the plot because it is very creative and filled with a fabulous cast of supporting characters. Freeing Asia is a great story about finding yourself and finding your own self-worth. 
 ""You should be proud of who you are babe, 'cause you are amazing."" 
 Don't worry, there's lots and lots of steam in this book! This is the kind of book that you start reading and don't put down until you're finished. I absolutely felt a deep connection to these characters, and must admit that it was tough to pick between Marcus and Jay! But ultimately this is a book about learning to love yourself before you can let others love you. And for that, the author should be applauded.

This book is a must-read, your life will be all the richer for reading it. 
 Fern has been the plain girl for most of her life, the quiet kind of girl who fades into the background. She has an incredibly close bond with her cousin, and with him and Ambrose, form the heart of this story. 
 Fern, Ambrose and Bailey all attended high school together and Fern loved Amborse from afar. Ambrose was the star wrestler and had his pick of the prettiest girls. The way Amy Harmon writes about high school was incredibly funny and painful at the same time. But then after graduation, Ambrose leaves for Iraq and returns a very changed man. 
 ""Sometimes you can't take your life back. Sometimes it's dead and buried and you can only make a new life. Ambrose didn't know what that life would look like."" 
 For the first time, he really gets to know Fern and sees her true inner beauty. But Fern is still incredibly insecure about her outward appearance, and is desperate to have Ambrose really desire her as a beautiful woman. 
 ""But I would really like it if, for once, I could be beautiful on the outside.""

 So do I! What started off for me as a classic Young Adult book became much, much more! (Jake Andrews, where have you been all my life?) This story is both very sweet and very, very hot, which I love. Mikayla is not only faced with heartbreak very early on in this story, but she is also faced with an unspeakable tragedy. To the rescue comes the hot Jake Andrews, who is actually a really, really great guy underneath all that baseball-playing hotness. And he's funny, too. Mikayla has moments of humor, too, which totally works to lighten up the darker parts of this story. 
 Jake and Mikayla have some very explicit sessions together but they do not take their relationship past a certain point throughout much of the story. But it actually works! The tension between the two characters keeps the story moving forward and kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next: 
 ""The sexual tension between Jake and I is off the charts. I'm actually scared I might combust any second. No joke."" - Mikayla 
 They both want to be more, they want it all. I loved this story and loved the author's writing style. There's drama, humor, lots of sexual tension, plenty of sexy times, and a great story line. Highly recommended for anyone who loves a hot young adult story.

 Let's start with Greg Cage. Lord this man is HOT. He is super-protective, loyal and knows pretty much right away that Melissa is very different from any of the women he has been involved with (and there are plenty!) He is used to being pursued, not being the pursuer. 
 ""My body wants her; that is no secret, but level of want is borderline craving. I need her. Needing someone is not something I am used to. No, I am used to being needed...something this woman clearly doesn't want."" 
 Cage and Melissa connect on a deeper level than just the hot sex but Melissa is a tough character. She is used to being the strong one in her family, and they rely on for everything. She is very wary of men and relationships. Will she let her guard down and let Cage in? I wanted her to open her heart to Cage and trust him completely from the very beginning, but she is too wary. 
 ""No, even with the perfect sex, I have learned enough from my sister to know it isn't wise to let a man have your heart. When that happens, it is only a matter of time before you lose yourself."" 
 There are a lot of twists to the story and one very large secret that threatens to tear Cage and Melissa apart. These two are so amazing together, that I was on the edge of my seat until the very end. Cage knows Melissa is his ""missing piece"", and I absolutely loved the way the author concludes this story. I hope we get more of these two characters in future books. 
 I also loved the cast of supporting characters in this series, and cannot wait for Beck and Dee's story. Corps Security is a favorite series!

I loved this book. It is a story about real, working-class people with real problems and real passions. And the sex is OFF THE CHARTS! Kayden has a great job and a seemingly stable life, but has had anger issues and a psycho ex-girlfriend who made his life hell. He and Sophia connect through Facebook one day, and they begin to communicate and can't resist wanting to get to know each other better. He was a friend of her older brother and is very sexy and has an allure that Sophia can't resist. She leads a quiet life, and is looking for a little excitement and yes, even love. 
 Sophia is willing to take a risk on the handsome Kayden, and falls quickly for him. He really is a decent guy, but his internal demons threaten their relationship. I loved seeing these characters really develop and grow throughout this book, and the story kept me turning the pages until the end. I really was invested in these characters' stories and felt a connection with them from the very beginning. 
 Untangle Me is a great debut from this author. The characters have ordinary lives (no billionaires here!) but the sex scenes are scorching and their problems are real. The ending got a little dramatic but overall this was a very enjoyable read for me, and I recommend it for anyone who wants a hot, well-written and gripping story. 
 I also loved the New Orleans and Florida settings! The author really got it right on both accounts. I'm looking to more books from this author in the future.

It is so refreshing to read a modern, funny and very sexy story that still has some emotional weight to it. Andie is a hard-working lawyer, stuck on a personal and professional path that might not be right for her. It takes an impulsive trip to Vegas with friends to change everything. She meets gorgeous cowboy Mack, outrageous flirting ensues, and they have a smoking-hot one night stand. Mack is actually refreshingly open and honest about his feelings almost right from the start, which I really enjoyed about him: 
 ""It means if I want to get lucky with you, I should take the risk and tell you what's on my mind, because failing would be worse than never trying."" 
 Andie has her life mapped out in detail and refuses to budge, even when life throws her a few surprises. She has a tough time believing that a guy like Mack could be interested in her. 
 ""He sounded so sincere, it made my heart skip a beat. How could a guy that good in bed and this gorgeous be so nice?"" 
 Andie must be in control of every detail of her life at all times. I love how she evolves and grows as a character during Shine Not Burn and allows real life to change her rigid plans. There's lots of humor and some very hot sex in this book and I loved every minute. And, since I'm picky about this, kudos to Elle Casey for getting lots of legal details very accurate. 
 No spoilers but I absolutely loved the way the story concluded and I am really looking forward to more books like Shine Not Burn from Elle Casey!",Thu Sep 05 15:18:28 -0700 2013,Tue Sep 17 14:28:30 -0700 2013,Fri Sep 06 00:00:00 -0700 2013,Thu Sep 05 00:00:00 -0700 2013,1,0

I always want to have sex, but right now I want to have sex with the giant pair of scissors I'm currently holding in my hand and that wouldn't be good at all. Sex and scissors should never mix. 
 Poor Gavin! He is in love with Charlotte, with whom he grew up and who unfortunately has ""friend-zoned"" him. Or so he thinks. Love and Lists is the hilarious story of two twenty-somethings (and their group of friends) who constantly think about sex and how to have it. 
 If you've read any of Tara Sivec's hysterically funny Chocolate Lovers books, you know she is really foul-mouthed and really funny. Love and Lists is no different and it is a very cute and refreshing story. I loved the main characters, Gavin and Charlotte, and the supporting cast. This book also has a surprising change of course about mid-way through the story which I loved. Will Gavin get the girl? Will he move out of the ""friend zone""? Everything is answered in a very satisfying and funny way by the author. If you want a dirty, funny and fairly quick read, don't miss Love and Lists!

 Yes it is, dear readers, yes it is. I have a little secret: I started reading Stinger without even reading the book description. Not one blurb, not one review. I had a very long and stressful week when I looked at my reading calendar and saw Stinger up on deck. So I jumped right in. 
 I was hooked from the first page. Mia Sheridan has written a finely developed, emotionally charged and sexylicious book that I devoured very quickly. Grace and Stinger literally run right into each other in Vegas while both are attending very different conferences: she, a law conference, he, a porn convention. Yes, he is an adult film star. Grace is a straight-laced law student, hell-bent on following a certain career and life path and she absolutely, positively will not be pushed away from following her life plan! 
 So meeting a porn star doesn't exactly fit in with her well-made plans. 
 I could fill this review with breathtaking quotes from Stinger but I would love it if you would give this story a chance and read it with fresh eyes. The author has created a gorgeous, sexy but very smart and sensitive hero in Stinger, and a beautiful, smart and kind heroine in Grace. Neither is perfect, yet neither one is afraid to admit when they have made a mistake. There are also lots of essential supporting characters here, some living, some gone, who populate this book and make it come alive. 
 The characters also undergo tremendous emotional growth in Stinger, an essential development which is very often missing in a lot of books. For the storyline, the amazing sexy times, and the fabulous characters, I am giving Stinger five stars!",Thu Aug 29 19:39:42 -0700 2013,Sat Sep 28 14:49:51 -0700 2013,Sat Sep 28 14:49:51 -0700 2013,Fri Sep 27 00:00:00 -0700 2013,2,0

Bravo, Ms. Douglas! Well done. Note: although this book can be read as a standalone, I cannot recommend Bully and Until You highly enough. These books might not be everyone's cup of tea, but the sexual tension, the constant push-and-pull between the characters, the engaging and thoughtful story lines are among my very favorite books. 
 I have two words: JAX TRENT. Oh my lord. This book was well worth the wait just to get inside that sexy, beautiful head of his. 
 And K.C.? I absolutely adored reading about her history, her back story, and her motivations. This whole book was one delicious treat just begging to be unwrapped.

 Until You is one of those rare books that is as good, if not better, than the first book in the series. Bully is one of my favorite books ever and Until You has now taken its place as one of my all-time favorites. Jared got under my skin and would not let go! Ms. Douglas is an incredibly skilled writer and gifted storyteller who has created some of the most memorable characters I have ever read. 
 If you have not read Bully, I urge you to do so. The story has twists and surprises and beautifully-written characters. And the author has continued Jared and Tate's journey in Until You, 
 I absolutely devoured this book and loved getting inside Jared's head. And the pain he endured during his life, well, let's just say that I felt so much emotion for him I thought my heart would burst. There is also plenty of steam in Until You and I loved the intense chemistry between Tate and Jared.

 I am a huge fan of Penelope Douglas and her books are perfection to me. I was absolutely enthralled by Madoc and Fallon, I had always LOVED Madoc and was thrilled he was getting his own story. In Rival, the author deals with lots of emotion, heavy subjects and the pain of tragedy but she always throws in a little humor to lighten things up a bit. Madoc and Fallon have a forbidden love but the way the author tells their story, you fell nothing but empathy and love for them. 
 I absolutely love these characters, and how the author never disappoints with the steam and chemistry factor. Her writing is honest, elegant and blunt, and never filters out the harsh reality of life with hearts-and-butterflies. Madoc and Fallon have had some terrible things happen in their lives but they still turn out to be honest and good young adults. This series is one of my favorites and I highly recommend that you start with Bully, which is one of my all-time favorite books. 
 Tate and Jared do get an appearance here, as well as Jax, who is getting his own book soon (yay!). But Madoc and Fallon are the focus and they are fantastic characters. I love Madoc's hot, tough-guy exterior and Fallon's off-beat personality. Of course, they are are hiding their pain and they must work through lots of miscommunication before we get to their very satisfying conclusion. 
 I absolutely loved this book and can't wait for Jax's story!

 One More Chance is an incredibly romantic and emotional story which is exactly what I have come to expect from Abbi Glines. I loved Grant in Take a Chance and was curious to see where the author would take her characters on the next step in their story. If you read Take a Chance, you know that Harlow has a secret that could have led to the end of her beautiful relationship with Grant. But in true Abbi Glines fashion, she takes the reader on an incredible journey through all the emotions as she gives Grant and Harlow an incredible HEA. 
 I am a huge Abbi Glines fan and each story is a little different. One More Chance is not a fun, light, beach read but instead a very romantic (for me), loving story that I devoured quickly. If you love the Rosemary Beach characters, then this is a must-read. Grant is unwavering in his devotion to Harlow and she is a loving, kind and beautiful character. One of my favorite female heroines from Abbi Glines. 
 There are a few surprises here and I don't want to get too detailed. Just enjoy this yummy book and all of the characters you have come to love from Abbi Glines' Rosemary Beach series.

I found it refreshing that he actually did not like to play games, even though he and Nellie started off their sizzling relationship with a ""no strings attached"" declaration. When he realizes how he really feels about Nellie, he is very honest and straightforward in his behavior, which I found to be very refreshing. Abel is actually an Alpha male who is very sweet, too. 
 Nellie is a very smart and strong character. She is recovering from a disastrous marriage and very painful divorce and vows not to get involved in a serious relationship. But along comes Abel, who is several years younger, by the way, and she is literally swept off her feet. 
 Elizabeth Reyes does a great job of developing their very sexually intense relationship outside the bedroom, too, and the supporting cast of 5th Street characters are all very well-written and developed. We are also introduced to some new supporting characters in Abel. 
 There is a very interesting storyline involving Abel's boxing opponent and I loved reading about the boxing world. I loved the mix of sports and romance in Abel. There are some intensely emotional moments in the story, which blend nicely with the hot sex scenes. Elizabeth Reyes has 
 created very rich and sexy story and I look forward to reading more of her books!

And I was afraid to give anything away on Goodreads. I literally had to email the author to ask her explicitly which category she thought this story should be in. It is NOT dark/taboo/forbidden. What it most defitnitely is: sweeping, grand, thrilling, exciting, heartbreaking, joyous and life-affirming. . . and unlike ANYTHING you've ever read from Pepper Winters. Enjoy the ride! 
 (The author has now revealed the inspiration behind the story and the full blurb on her website, check it out!!) 
 ""Love doesn't live in first glances. Life doesn't dwell in second chances. Our path exists in unseen messages."" 
 Yes, this is a long book, but trust me when I say that I flew through the pages. The story revolves around Estelle Evermore, who is a rising singer and songwriter but who is desperate to fly back home after being on a grueling tour. There are ominous signs everywhere warning her not to get on the plane. The sense of foreboding is almost suffocating! Also on her flight is Galloway Oak, and although these two are strangers, in a very short time they will become dependent on each other for their very lives. 
 Pepper Winters is one of my favorite dark romance authors. To say that I was pleasantly surprised by this book is an understatement. While there is dark sense of foreboding, Unseen Messages is in no way dark at all. It is a finely detailed, epic romance with thrilling elements and stunning settings. When the characters were exhausted, sunburned and starving, I felt their pain. When they suffer unimaginable loss, I felt their heartache. I connected with the characters and became immersed in their story of survival. 
 If you are looking for something very different to read, try Unseen Messages. The ending was surprising and beautiful and uplifting. I applaud the author for stepping outside her comfort zone and giving us Estelle and Galloway. They are two memorable characters that will stay with me for a long time.

I absolutely love dark and angsty books (hello, Captive in the Dark and Comfort Food) so the story line was perfect. The author takes you on an emotional roller coaster with this book and does not let up until the very last word. Tess is a strong and willful character and never once gives in to her situation. Her ""master"" Q is just amazing, yes, I said it, dark, sexy, irresistible...but there's much more to the man and his background then meets the eye. There's lots of very explicit sex, violence, slavery themes, BDSM and disturbing images in Tears of Tess but there's also beauty, redemption, exotic locales and incredibly well-written characters. I cannot wait for the next book from this author, which will be about Q. This book is one of my top reads of 2013. Don't miss it.

She is young, far from her home in Georgia, at college in California with no way to pay her tuition or living expenses. She has been alienated from her father, a very strict pastor who would definitely NOT approve of the choices she is forced to make. 
 The first part of the book started out a little slow for me but then WOW! When Grey (as ""Gracie"", her stage name) meets famous actor Dawson Kellor at the dance club, the book really takes off. He is immediately drawn to Grey's kind nature and goodness. 
 ""Dawson doesn't answer, but this isn't a pause-- this is the silence of a man who knows nothing he says will make it okay, so he doesn't say anything. It's perfect. After a long moment, he tugs me closer and murmurs, ""Let me hold you."" I'm still, totally tensed now. ""Hold me?"" ""Yeah. Just hold you. No pressure. It's not going anywhere. Just be in the moment with me."" 
 Dawson is a world-weary Hollywood actor, and it turns out that Grey is actually his new assistant on his current movie. Despite her innocence and inexperience, she and Dawson fall for each other. 
 I enjoyed the Hollywood behind-the-scenes aspect of the storyline. The writing in Stripped is excellent, fast-paced and VERY sexy. Grey and Dawson really heat up the pages! They have an undeniable chemistry. 
 I also liked that Dawson really doesn't play games with Grey. He is very open and honest about his feelings for Grey, and he really treats her with love and care: 
 ""Then, something odd happens: Dawson presses a soft kiss to my temple. It's. . . tender. It's a kiss designed to soothe, to comfort. Not to ignite desire or passion. It confuses me, and it makes me feel. . .loved. Cared for."" 
 I love what the title of the book stands for, it's not what you think! Ms. Wilder has written characters that I actually cared about, and has written some super-steamy scenes. Stripped is a very sexy story, that totally surprised me with its storyline and characters. Enjoy!

First, let me say that these characters are some of my favorite fictional characters and I am a huge fan of the The Artists Trilogy. I highly recommend the series, they are some of the most thrilling, touching, sexy and gritty books you will ever read. Dirty Angels is a standalone novel and you absolutely can dive in without reading any of the other books, but just make sure you pick them up at some point! 
 Dirty Angels is without question very, very violent; very, very dirty and sexy. It is another WILD ride from Karina Halle!! The story takes place among Mexican drug cartel members in Mexico but at its heart, it is a tender (well, kind of) and beautiful love story. Javier commits unspeakable acts but he is also a human being and becomes obsessed with Luisa, after he kidnaps her and holds her for ransom, The problem is that Luisa has gone from one violent and dysfunctional man to another. She is incredibly resilient and strong but finds herself drawn to the very alluring Javier. 
 I found the sex scenes to be incredibly alluring and the alternating POV's worked perfectly here. I highly recommend this book if you want to read a story that is not all rainbows and unicorns but is instead filled with gritty characters, painful choices, incredibly satisfying love scenes and some wild, violent action. Another fantastic story from Karina Halle. #TeamJavier all the way, baby.

The last half of Panic is very fast-paced and almost morphed into a thriller which was fine by me. I absolutely love all the characters in these stories (even the ones I love to hate) but I really love Ford. 
 Rook turns into a very, strong heroine and you can see how resilient she really is. But she is far from perfect which is one of the things I liked about this story. I liked how she interacted with Ford and in particular there is a scene between her and Ford that could have taken a predicatble turn but didn't.

The hot male lead is a virgin! Bennett Reynolds, the sexy, tattoo-artist neighbor of nursing student Avery, is looking for a loving and meaningful relationship, and not just a random hook-up. Which is not to say he hasn't had some experience. 
 ""Damn it, Bennett,"" I panted. ""How in the hell do you know how exactly to drive me insane?"" 
 ""I said I was a virgin, Avery. Not a saint."" 
 ""Or even a monk, apparently,"" I mumbled. I felt him smile against my skin. 
 The main character, Avery, keeps giving away pieces of herself by hooking up with other guys but she keeps her real feelings locked away. With Bennett's help, she finds the strength to confront the demons in her past, and confront the past demons which keep her from forming a loving relationship. I liked how strong her character was. I also liked Avery's relationship with her best friends, which was funny and realistic. 
 The best part of All of You was without a doubt Bennett! I loved that he was both sexy and romantic, artistic and extremely honest. No game-playing here.

 In this follow-up to one of my favorite books of all time, Sempre, JM Darhower takes us on a tension-filled ride though the inner workings of a mob family. Carmine and Haven are forced to make heart-breaking and difficult decisions early in this story that lead to a surprising and thrilling read. Ms. Darhower is an extremely gifted writer and she has crafted memorable characters that will stay with you long after you finish this story. 
 Sempre opened with one of the most heartbreaking and harrowing scenes I have ever read. Carmine and Haven are two of my favorite fictional characters and I had been waiting anxiously for their story to continue. Sempre: Redemption is very much a gripping crime story, but really delivers on the emotion and romance. I was very sad to see Carmine and Haven's story come to an end, but the author delivers an absolutely fantastic conclusion!

I absolutely loved Lola Stark's first book in this series, Tattered Love, and couldn't wait for the second book! Conflicted Love is the story of Teeny and Trip, who we first met in Tattered Love. I highly recommend reading Book #1 first to get a feel for the background story of these characters, and also because it's a surprisingly engaging and sexy story. Teeny is a tough character, very independent, and finds herself in an unexpected situation after a hot night with the very sexy tatted and pierced Trip. She really doesn't want to fall for Trip but he does some pretty amazing things to prove himself a worthy partner. He has never been in a lasting relationship but to his credit, really fights his way into Teeny's life. Lots of really hot sex ensues, along with some very funny moments due to her pregnancy. I would have liked a little more depth to this story but overall, Conflicted Love is a fairly quick, really hot read with lots of very sexy and likable characters.

Exploring themes of friendship, loyalty, love, survival and acceptance, Leah Raeder writes in a way that will haunt you and make you question the very nature of right and wrong. Maise is not your typical heroine, and her story is both heartbreaking and triumphant at the same time. And the sex scenes are completely off the charts.

 ""It begins with a whimper but ends in a bang."" 
 Tiffany Resisz has written what might be her best book so far! The story of how Eleanor and Soren first met is told in intimate detail as Nora tells the tale over one one night of passion with her lover. The Saint is told in flashback and although you might think you know the story, the funny, tragic and sexy details come to life at Tiffany Reisz's gifted hands. 
 ""When we met he said, 'It's a pleasure to finally meet you.' We'd both been waiting for each other, like it was meant to be that we would find and love each other."" 
 How Soren finally brings the wild and disobedient Eleanor under control is fascinating. Her relationship with her parents is heartbreaking and the blooming of Soren, Nora and Kingsley's inevitable and lifelong bond is a beautiful and very sexy thing to watch unfold. I could not put this book down and felt like I was spending time with some old (if not very dangerous) friends. I loved the switching back and forth between past and present as an adult Nora tells the story to her current lover (no spoilers as to his identity!) The Saint is another perfectly-written, highly erotic novel from Ms. Reisz, with a healthy dose of sarcasm and humor and even some religious eduction and philosophy thrown in. Don't miss this one!

I am equally fascinated by pen names, and even when the writer professes to be one gender or the other (or leaves it open to the imagination such as BG Harlen), I still wonder at the back of my mind whether the author is a male or female. Do some female writers have a decidedly masculine POV? Yes, there are several that come to mind. Do some male writers have a feminine ""flavor"" to their writing? It seems so. 
 And so we come to the fascinating Thou Shalt Not. I loved Luke's story, as well as JJ Rossum's writing style, and don't want to be pigeon-holed into thinking that the author is male or female. That's just me. Either way, it's a very sexy and engaging book with plenty of steamy scenes to satisfy even the most jaded erotic romance reader (such as myself). The story carries some very weighty themes (domestic violence, adultery, the nature of beauty), but the book is very fast-paced and satisfying. Will Luke keep himself out of trouble with April? Will he learn to really love someone again? No spoilers here, but the author answers these questions while exploring what qualities are really important and what makes someone worthy of love. 
 This book has a very interesting conclusion that some readers will love, and some might find a little challenging. I loved it and can't wait to read more from this author.

 What can I say about Tarryn Fisher other than she is one of my favorite writers? Her style is powerful, clean, bold and unapologetic. Mud Vein is no exception. Senna and Isaac's story is not what you think, and not at all what you would you expect. This book totally took me off guard because I didn't read any reviews with spoilers in them. Like her earlier books (The Love Me with Lies series), this story is brutally honest, and is not a hearts-and-flowers, sugary-sweet romance. 
 The plot is incredibly inventive and different, and stunning as well. I fell in love with Isaac and by the end of the book, also really cared about Senna even though as with other characters written by Ms. Fisher, she is a prickly sort. I did not see the ending of this book coming, and it is really best if you don't know the ending as well. Mud Vein is another incredibly written book by Tarryn Fisher. She poured her heart and soul into this book and it really shows. I highly recommend Mud Vein.

This is an incredibly rich and completely satisfying conclusion to the Original Sinners series. All of the characters are brought together in The Mistress and their rich and complex stories are told in a very clever and gripping way. I can't do justice to a book that is so masterfully written and so filled with erotic and sensual images that I literally could not put it down. 
 You must read The Original Sinners series first so that you will be familiar with the intricate and complex histories of the gorgeous and fierce characters created by Tiffany Reisz. In The Mistress, Nora is forced to recount stories of her past with Kingsley and Soren. 
 ""You're my favorite monster, she said against his lips."" 
 ""She felt pleasure with other men, ecstasy even sometimes...but only when Soren was inside her did she feel whole. 
 Soren and Kingsley spring into action to rescue Nora and both recall their memories of their relationship with Nora and with each other."" 
 ""Soren could not live in a world without Nora. Kingsley could not live in a world without Soren."" 
 Wesley also rushes to help rescue Nora, along with Zachary's wife, Grace. Soren's niece Laila also forms an important part of the author's elaborate story of love, submission and erotica, a story that does not contain one false move or one unimportant character. 
 I don't want to give away any spoilers but suffice it to say that Tiffany Reisz has created a brilliant cast of characters and a story that will challenge you, thrill you and leave you breathless with anticipation. I was on the edge of my seat while reading The Mistress, hoping that Soren and Nora's unbreakable bond would get then through this latest crisis. 
 ""The fire of her teenage infatuation with Soren had burned itself out years ago. In its flames a love made of iron had been forged. It could survive any blow, any trial."" 
 The ending of this story was incredibly emotionally satisfying, and perfect for each character. The Mistress is a brilliant ending to an absolutely amazing series.

This man is so hot, he practically jumps off the page! 
 Tattoo artist Sacrlett knows she is in for trouble when Mace walks in to her tattoo parlor. The brother of one of her artists, Mace never forms a connection with women, until of course, he meets the smart, sexy and very strong-willed Scarlett. These two have sizzling chemistry right from the start, and I loved that Mace went for it right from the beginning. And in between the wonderfully steamy sex scenes, there's actually a good story, too! Mace and Scar both have secrets in their pasts that threaten their happiness together.

Addison has lived through the most unimaginable childhood and her tough-as-nails exterior hides a world of pain and hurt. She locates her father, Jackson, who is the bad-ass President of the Hell's Knights MC. Their story is completely heartbreaking and makes for a solid foundation for the story.

 ""The thing is, I'm happy being me and I sure as fuck won't change for anyone. I don't need fixing because I'm not broken. I simply work hard and play harder. Things are great. I'm exactly where I want to be at twenty-five years old."" 
 Seduce totally grabbed me from the very beginning and I read it one sitting. Jack is a rich, callous, irresistible bachelor, who is quite honest about the way he treats women. But I also found him very vulnerable and likable, with a strong support group of very close friends and a brother with whom he shares a close bond. The rest of his family, not so much, which is where his feelings of unworthiness and abandonment come from. Enter the gorgeous and spirited Belle, with whom Jack actually develops a deep emotional attachment. Seduce was going in one direction, with lots of super-steamy and graphic sex scenes, and then, whoa, suddenly took a complete left-turn!

 Wow,what a wild ride. As a huge fan of the Edge of Never, I picked up this book without knowing anything about the story, I only knew that Andrew and Camryn would be making a cameo appearance. 
 Bray and Elias met as children and grew up best friends, Bray was pretty much ignored by her family and suffered from benign neglect. She seemed like the wild child but really she was afraid to form bonds or attachments to people because she didn't understand that the other people could actually care for her. 
 Elias was in love and devoted to Bray no matter what. This New Adult book contained some pretty spicy sex scenes but I felt they fit in with the story of the young characters as they grew and explored the world and their relationships. 
 A shocking event occurs and Bray and Elias find themselves on the road. Many adventures ensue, and they meet up with another group young wanderers. I never thought there would be a HEA to this story based on their almost daily physical struggles and Bray's battle with bipolar disorder. depression. Elias would never leave a Bray no matter what, so it was difficult to see how there would be a satisfying conclusion to this book, but there was. 
 I read several very negative reviews of this book and I don't agree at all. This book has enough drama, emotion and sexy times to satisfy any fan of New Adult books. Even though the ending seemed bleak at one point, I was very happy to see Bray and Elias get the ending they so deserved.",Thu Jul 11 20:27:56 -0700 2013,Sun Feb 09 01:11:53 -0800 2014,Sun Feb 09 01:11:53 -0800 2014,Sat Feb 08 00:00:00 -0800 2014,0,0

 First, please note the author's warning about the domestic violence scenes. They are intense! With that said, this is the story of misunderstandings, missed opportunities and a second chance at love. Years before, Izzy waited for Axel to return home from basic training, but a series of miscommunications and misunderstandings kept them apart. Izzy goes on to marry Brandon, who she thought was a wonderful guy, but it turned out she was entering into a horrible, abusive marriage. 
 ""People say karma is a bitch but I have news for you, karma doesn't have anything on fate when she is after blood. Not a single thing."" 
 ""The past can't touch me. I am stronger than this. I am a survivor."" 
 Izzy is literally saved from her abusive marriage by her best friend Dee, and by chance runs into Axel one night. He has started Corps Security with his friend Greg Cage, who also happens to be Izzy's friend and protector. Axel is shocked to see Izzy again, the woman he thought had abandoned him years before. 
 ""She was mine. She is mine. She will always fucking be mine."" 
 Izzy tries desperately to avoid confronting Axel because he had ripped her heart out years before. But Axel will not let her go so easily this time and demands that they clear the air. 
 ""Sugar, I have thought about sex, hard fucking dirty sex, about a hundred times since we sat down to eat."" ""Does that clear it up for you?"" 
 ""Never again, Izzy West. I will never again let anyone take you from me, or anything from us."" His words hang between us both as a promise and a threat."" 
 Cathy and I loved this book! We love Izzy, who was a fighter through all of the very rough events in her life. We love Axel, who still wants to protect Izzy, even though he too thought she had abandoned him years before. This book is filled with hot guys, rough talk and explicit sex. What's not to love? 
 ""Never letting you go, Izzy. Never."" He whispers into my hair, squeezing me a little tighter. 
 ""I always have been yours, you know that, don't you?""

This is the perfect book to lose yourself in, and just enjoy the story. I loved the San Francisco setting, and the secondary characters were well-thought-out also. I felt that Claire could have stopped doubting her relationship with Jonathan a little earlier on; I mean, here was a smart, successful businessman who clearly had real feelings for her and wasn't bothered at all by their age difference. Claire's continued insecurities were the only sticking point for me. The ending more than made up for that, and anyone who loves a HEA will love this book!

 We meet attorney Elle James who is a total workaholic and keeps her steady boyfriend pretty much at arms' length. Everything in her life is emotionless and neatly planned, just like she wants it. Elle doesn't want any drama or surprises in her life. Of course, all of this changes in a heartbeat when she meets MMA fighter Nico Hunter, and she knows her life will never be the same. 
 I've never seen a body like his so close before. It just doesn't seem real. Both of his arms are covered in tattoos, it looks like he's wearing colorful sleeves, only he has no shirt on. They intertwine and wrap around his bulging biceps and I get the urge to trace a path from the first splat of ink to the last with my tongue. My body's reaction to him is unlike anything I've ever felt before. These aren't feelings that I'm used to, they seem to come out of nowhere and are uncontrollable. 
 There are very painful reasons why Elle keeps her life relatively everything drama-free, and Nico, too, has had a traumatic event in his life which is revealed very early on in the book. Luckily for Elle, Nico knows what he wants and goes after it and wow! Nico is one HOT Alpha male, a really gorgeous, sexy and actually NICE guy who tries to break down the walls around Elle's heart and emotions. 
 I know I could have taken it further after that kiss. But I don't want one night with Elle. I want more. I have no idea why, but I do. A lot fucking more. 
 I absolutely love Nico! He took my breath away! He is tough, sensitive, strong and tender all at once. He loves his family and they form a tight bond around him. He has a loyal group of friends and trainers around him. Elle doesn't feel worthy of him or his attention and all of this builds to an amazing climax which will have you on the edge of your seat, crying and cheering at the same time. 
 Ms. Keeland has written a very adult story, with adult themes and problems, along with some of the most breathtaking love scenes I've ever read. Have a cold shower ready when you read Worth the Fight, you'll need it! I literally cannot wait for more stories in this series from Ms. Keeland.",Sun Jun 23 06:39:37 -0700 2013,Thu Oct 03 07:12:00 -0700 2013,Mon Sep 30 00:00:00 -0700 2013,Sun Sep 29 00:00:00 -0700 2013,1,0

Trent is hard-loving, hard-working, loyal and completely devoted to Cami. She is a good girl dealing with a bad family situation and trying to keep up with two jobs, school and TJ, her long-distance boyfriend who is does not seem to have much time for her because of his mysterious job in California. 
 What we loved best about this story is the devotion of Trenton to Cami. At first he comes off as a player but he is far from that and when he makes his true feelings known to Cami, he is totally swoon-y. He's uber-sexy, hot and protective. 
 ""Because I've been in love with you since grade school, Chamomile. And everyone knew it. Everyone."" 
 We also loved Cami, she is dealing with more than her share of stress between her seriously dysfunctional family, school, juggling two jobs and her mystery boyfriend TJ in California. We both really liked this book because of our devotion to the Maddox Brothers, BUT we did not like how Trent's longtime love for Cami was not described in more detail, maybe through a memory, or another scene or two. That led to a little bit of a disconnect between the two main characters. We are sworn to secrecy about giving away any spoilers but be aware there is a SHOCKER of an abrupt, surprise ending! Cathy figured it out from the beginning but I was clueless. And, the author just announced that the next installment will be BEAUTIFUL REDEMPTION, the oldest Maddox Brother's story. We will definitely read the next book because who doesn't absolutely love the Maddox Brothers??!

This is a magical, imaginative story that follows Lily, a young prodigy who is suddenly forced to become a leader along with three other friends. Lily is a ""hybrid"", which is very dangerous in the mystical world created by Scarlett Dawn. The action-packed story follows young Lily as she experiences loss, self-doubt and many epic challenges on her path to becoming the leader she is meant to be. 
 The author has created some great supporting characters in Ezra, Jack and Pearl. I especially enjoyed reading about the relationship and strong connection between Lily and Ezra, the sexy Vampire. There is lots of talk about sex and sexual tension in this book, but nothing too explicit. 
 King Hall ends with a cliffhanger, but it is the kind of ending that leaves you ready for the next installment in this story! This book was a very different read, and I recommend it for anyone interested in stories about magical, mystical worlds.

And to all of the readers who have experienced Leo, you must read this book. I was absolutely blown away by the writing, the characters, the story, and the very, very steamy sex!! This book had everything I love about a great book. Mia Sheridan is an absolutely amazing writer. This series is going on my list of favorite books. 
 Please read Leo, Book One in this series, before you read Leo's Chance. It is told from Evie's POV and you will be lost on some of the details and characters in this book without having read Leo. 
 I LOVE Leo! He is hiding a terrible trauma, desperate to get close to Evie, and trying to get closure on his very troubled past. 
 Leo and Evie both grew up in the foster system and he vowed to return for her when she turned 18. That became impossible and now 8 years later, he enters her life again: 
 ""After only a couple days of following Evie, I was pretty damn sure that I was already even more in love with her than I was when I was 15 years old. Now I just had to figure out what the hell to do."" 
 Nothing I write here will do justice to this incredible story of abuse, shame, betrayal and ultimately, honesty and the power of love. Leo's flashbacks to his time in the foster care system are gut-wrenching. I can't even imagine doing the research for this part of the story. My heart went out to these fictional characters and to all kids in the foster care system. 
 Leo's feelings for Evie are incredibly intense even though he is filled with doubt and self-loathing. But Leo's Chance is not just the story of two broken kids in the foster care system. It is an amazing love story, with some graphic and super-steamy sex scenes! ""World's Greatest"", indeed! 
 ""This is the second most incredible kiss of my life. The first was with the same girl."" 
 This book contained one of the best epilogues I have ever read. Leo's Chance is a must-read. I can't wait to read more from Mia Sheridan!Leo's ChanceMia Sheridan",Tue Jun 18 23:00:45 -0700 2013,Wed Jun 19 08:17:40 -0700 2013,Tue Jun 18 00:00:00 -0700 2013,,1,0

 Mary Whitney is a fantastic writer and she gives us an absolutely beautiful story about first love. The story tells us what happened years before between Nicki and Adam. Nicki has never really gotten over Adam, even though they were very close while in high school. Adam helped Nicki cope with the sudden death of her sister and Nicki falls for him. 
 This book has a much more emotional feel than most stories about high schoolers. I felt that both Nicki and Adam were very mature for their age, which I appreciated. All in all, this is a wonderful story with very well-written characters. The author throws a few things in the way of Nicki and Adam finally being together, and the ending will really leave you wanting to read much more from Mary Whitney!

 Crashed is an absolutely breathtaking and stunning conclusion to the Driven Trilogy! I don't ever write long reviews but for some reason it has been very difficult for me to put into words the emotions that this book instilled in me. It has been a bag of mixed emotions saying goodbye to Colton and Rylee. 
 Spiderman. Batman. Superman. Ironman 
 I had a million theories about where this book would go after the absolutely heart-stopping ending of Fueled. It is a tribute to the author's incredible talent that all of my theories were wrong, and Colton and Rylee's story took me on an emotional journey that has stayed with me weeks after finishing this book. I felt every gut-wrenching scene, every emotional high and low and every triumph right down to my very soul. 
 There are some absolutely beautiful scenes in Crashed and there are some absolutely soul-punching, nail-biting ones, too. Each scene felt essential to the book, and I also loved how every character was fully explored in Crashed. I was on the edge of my seat throughout most of Crashed, but yet at the same time I didn't want to say goodbye to Colton and Rylee. This is a substantial, juicy story that is meant to be savored and enjoyed. And the Epilogue! Kristy Bromberg has earned a place in my heart previously reserved only for Kristen Ashley and Jodi Ellen Malpas with the fantastic Epilogue in Crashed. 
 ""Remember, hurting is feeling and feeling is living and isn't it good to be alive?"" 
 Colton's painful past is fully explored in Crashed and many questions are answered. Rylee continues to be one of the strongest heroines around and had me cheering and weeping throughout many parts of the book. The plot is very inventive and there are several relationships that I hope the author will explore in the future. Do not miss Crashed. It is absolute perfection, ""A to motherfucking Z""!!

Disclaimer: I am no writer, so anything I say here will not be able to do justice to the amazing writing talent of K. Bromberg! So a few months ago a book called Driven landed in my in box along with a lovely email asking if Cathy and I would be interested in reading the book. Other obligations interfered until finally over the summer, I began reading what turned out to be one of my absolute favorite series ever! As a matter of fact, I started reading Driven (yes, I know this is the Fueled Blog Tour!) while I was on a family vacation that involved a lot of driving. Thankfully I have three other drivers in my family because every chance I got, I hopped in the back seat with my Kindle and said, ""Oh, a two-hour drive? No problem! Let's go!"" That's how obsessed I was with Colton and Rylee. I could not get enough of them. 
 I could not wait to dive into Fueled. And the author literally grabs your heart right from the very beginning and does. Not. Let. Go. My heart was pounding out of my chest for most of this book. And it's not just the amazingly steamy sex scenes between Colton and Rylee. It's the actions of Colton, it's Rylee's reactions, it's the secondary characters, the racing scenes, the emotional connection between Rylee and Colton. . . Well, you get the picture. 
 My blogging partner Cathy read Fueled after release day, and was very skeptical about my ranting and raving about Colton and Rylee. Well, she loved it MORE than Driven, and she is almost always disappointed with sequels! 
 Fueled has inspired a lot of fervor from readers and the author kindly responds to every comment, email and Tweet about Colton and Rylee. She is clearly as passionate about her characters as we are. We RACE you, Kristy! 
 So there's our little review. No detailed plot descriptions here because this book should most definitely be read without any spoilers, because the story is just, wow. Will you have a book hangover after reading Fueled? Oh, yeah. But please don't bother the author!

I absolutely loved this story about Cali, a girl whose life is ""empty, closed off and bleak,"" even though outwardly she plays the part of the popular, carefree party girl. Cali devotes her time and energy to torturing Logan, planning one elaborate prank after another. Why does she hate Logan so much? The author keeps us guessing, only revealing that once upon a time, Logan was the best friend of Cali's brother, Ben. The story kept me turning the pages to find out why Logan allowed Cali to hate him so much, and what actually happened to Ben: 
 ""Our rivalry is beautiful, because it makes us both forget about everything else."" 
 It turns out that Cali and Logan actually have a lot more in common than Cali thought at first. They both love poetry, which plays a very important role in 'Two Roads.' As much as Cali's hateful behavior frustrated me at times, I absolutely loved Logan! He is a gorgeous nerd, who allows Cali to vent her emotions and hatred towards him, and just does not back down. 
 Logan sees the ""real"" Cali underneath her hateful and mean treatment of him, and tries to help her let go of her anger, and tries to shows her that her life can have meaning. He is funny, sensitive and caring. Although he plays along with Cali's constant pranks and her relentless hatred of him, he realizes what they have together. Will Cali ever recognize what is right in front of her? Will Logan let Cali push him away? 'Two Roads' answers all of these questions in a very emotionally satisfying conclusion. And trust me, Logan has now become of my favorite book boyfriends. 
 ""Because you stole my heart, Cali,"" he whispers, running his hand along my cheeks. ""You stole my heart and now you won't let me have yours."" 
 Two Roads is a wonderfully-written, emotion-filled story that shows that no matter how hard you search, sometimes love is right in front of you. Well done, L.M. Augustine! Looking forward to many more books from this very talented writer.

 R.K. Lilley is one of my favorite writers and boy does she deliver an amazing story in Bad Things! I could not get enough of Danika and Tristan and I am anxiously awaiting more of their story. 
 There is no insta-love here. The author takes the time to build a deep friendship between Danika and Tristan but they do have an undeniable chemistry that they cannot ignore. Danika has a long list of strict rules for relationships and Tristan, well, let's just say that Tristan falls into the bad-boy category which Danika is trying to avoid. 
 Danika is totally honest and open with Tristan. He is who he is, and in his own way, is honest with Danika, too. If you have read the Up in the Air series (not necessary for this book but an amazing series), you know that Bad Things takes place several years before James Cavendish meets Bianca, and that Tristan gets clean and sober. You also know that something very tragic happens between Tristan and Danika. 
 There are several fantastic plot twists that I did not see coming in Bad Things. There are also several well-developed side characters with great stories. But Bad Things focuses on the EXPLOSIVE attraction and oh-so-steamy sex between Tristan and Danika and the author really knows how to deliver some heart-pounding sex scenes! Writers, take note: this is how you write contemporary romance! 
 ""Oh, I like this one, I thought, watching his throat work as he swallowed. A sexy man who liked sarcastic women..."" 
 - Danika 
 ""You feel so good, sweetheart. I swear nothing's ever felt better in my whole fucking life.""

 It is a fairly quick and very entertaining read. The story follows Aubrey and Zach (Riff's ""real"" name), as they return to Aubrey's home to meet with her father over a legal matter. Except that Aubrey hasn't told her parents she was bringing home her tattooed, rocker boyfriend! The awkward situation with Aubrey's very conservative parents only adds to Zach's insecurities, as he struggles to convince himself that he is good enough for Aubrey. 
 Much drama and hot sex then ensues in this very steamy novella. Will Zach and Aubrey let outside influences drive them apart? Will Aubrey cave in to her conservative parents and leave Zach? Everything comes to a very satisfying conclusion in this story. As usual, Michelle Valentine really delivers a catchy plot with very memorable characters and some scorching hot scenes. 
 I love Aubrey and Zach. Rock My World is a great entry in the Black Falcon series, and I'm looking forward to reading Trip's story next, in Rock the Beat!

This book begins two years after Drew and Kate begin dating, and they are living together in New York City. Their chemistry is still HOT and sizzling, of course, because this is the Tangled series after all, but a very serious misunderstanding occurs which threatens the couple's Happily Ever After. What could be a simple event in the hands of another writer becomes an emotional roller coaster that kept me reading this book almost in one sitting. 
 There is tons of snappy dialogue and some very funny moments, mostly thanks to Kate's friend Delores. There are a lot of great twists and turns in this book and although I thought I would not be ""hooked"" on Kate's POV, I absolutely loved reading her POV. She is smart, witty, funny and sensitive. But I think my my favorite part of the whole book might be the Epilogue, which is written in my boyfriend's (oops, I mean) DREW's POV. The wonderful cast of supporting characters makes their appearances in Twisted, and I loved each and every one of them. Twisted is a funny, witty, intelligent and very sexy book and I cannot wait for Tamed!!

 I couldn't put Rogue down and found myself consumed by Greyson and Melanie's story. The book swept me along for a hot and delicious ride filled with emotion, happiness, and some trepidation. Would Melanie tame her guy? Would Greyson be able to keep his secrets from Melanie without destroying them both? 
 Melanie has been unlucky at love and falls hard for Greyson. 
 ""He's a ten. I've never, ever been with a ten. And the way that he looks at me... I've seen that look before. The look that Remington Tate gives Brooke. That look. He's giving it to me and I'm dying inside. Can I die from one look? And if one look can kill me, then what would one touch do?"" 
 So Melanie and Greyson have unbelievably hot chemistry but the tension comes from whether their relationship will survive once his true relationship with her is revealed. 
 Greyson is everything I love about a Katy Evans hero - he's possessive, protective, hot and very demanding. I absolutely loved the writing and the story as well as the dual POV. Rogue is a totally exhilarating, sexy ride from one of my very favorite authors and I can't wait to read more from Katy!! 
 ""With you and me, there are no givens. No rules. Just what we want. And I want every inch of you. I want what you've given no one.""

Ripped was an unexpected gem from one of my favorite authors ever and I loved it from beginning to end! Pandora is a feisty, strong, take-no-prisoners heroine who came charging out of the gate at a hundred miles an hour. From the opening scene of Ripped when she and her best friend are planning a pay-back to Mackenna, to the very end, Pandora grabbed my heart and didn't let go. 
 Pandora has always felt crushed and alone after her first and only love broke her heart. And then went on to sing about it! Her life has become focused on getting revenge on the only man she has ever loved left her with not a look back. Mackenna was her true love, before he became a famous rock star, and to her horror, he wrote a hit song about her! She has spent years hating him. 
 When her prank goes wrong, to stay out of trouble, she must make a deal that involves her going on tour with the band. Will she be able to come to terms with what Mackenna did to her all those years ago? Will Mackenna be able to make her understand why he did what he did? 
 Sex, sex, and rock-n-roll. Mackenna is a sex god and Katy Evans doesn't let you forget it! Ripped actually has more humor in it than the other books in this series and I loved it!! And of course, lots and lots of heart in this one. 
 Ripped is classic Katy Evans, with a twist! The heroine is angry and heartbroken but tough as nails. The hero is sexy as hell, possessive and tenacious. I highlighted so much from this book that I'll just share my favorite quotes here: 
 ""Stupid girl attracted to bad boy, V card handed over, heart broken, end of story. I'm not even worried about him."" 
 ""I'm familiar with Pandora and her mistake - letting all kinds of bad shit into the world when she opened the box. I've always been at war with my name. I'm angry at it because, right away, it makes me think I can never really be good. I'm a jinx."" 
 ""God, I'm such a bluffer. Black clothes, black nails? I'm a pussy. An innocent little kitty pretending to be Catwoman. This man could kill me, over and over, until my nine lives are done."" 
 I absolutely adored Ripped and have now added Mackenna to my list of favorite book boyfriends!

Katy's intimate portrayal of Remy's innermost thoughts and feelings is always fascinating, and at times heartbreaking, as the reader witnesses his constant struggle to love, be loved and simply live in the world. 
 Remy is not a standalone book by any means and I recommend you read Real and Mine first. Katy has created an unforgettable character in Remington Tate and her books have resonated with legions of fans, myself included. I absolutely loved reading Remy's POV and devoured this book almost in one sitting. Remy is almost painfully flawed as a human being but is also desperate find love and some kind of balance in his life. His struggles are, for me, the crux of this story. I loved him through all his highs and lows and hoped he would get his HEA! 
 You know you are getting loads of steamy sex if you have read Real and Mine. And Katy Evans really delivers on the hot and VERY primal sex scenes in Remy. Whew! It is Remy's POV, after all. Remy and Brooke's scenes together are totally hot. And very, very satisfying. 
 I absolutely loved the conclusion to Remy and Brooke's story, but I was a little sad to reach the end of this book! Like all of Katy's fervent fans, l feel very connected to Remy and Brooke and hope that we hear a little more from them in the next two books, Ripped and Raw. I give Remy 5 swoony stars!!

It is told from Dex's POV and because this is a spoiler-free review, let's just say that the author really knows how to wring every drop of honesty and truth from her characters. 
 ""Shut the fuck up, man. Get over it. Shape up or ship out. Don't think I wasn't yelling those things in my head. But when the fuck did my head and heart get along anyway? They were mortal enemies now, sworn to rip each other to shreds."" 
 But since this part of the EIT series after all, there is still plenty of action to go around. When Dex is abruptly summoned by Little Fifteen aka Ada to help Perry, he doesn't hesitate to jump right back into the fray to save Perry from mortal danger.

Raine Miller has written a fantastic, intriguing and SUPER hot conclusion to Ethan and Brynne's story. 
 Could there be a hotter book husband than Ethan Blackstone? I really don't think so! 
 ""Ethan filled me up on a steady thrust, his hands at my hips for leverage. He made that breathy groan of pleasure that I loved to hear from him as he sank into me. ""Feel that, my beauty. All of it--just for you."" 
 As a newlywed and expectant mother, Brynne still feels a little insecure even though Ethan is clearly devoted to her. She is a plain-spoken woman, and not yet totally comfortable in the rarefied atmosphere of Ethan Blackstone's world. 
 ""Good sex wasn't love. 
 For me, honest devotion and loyalty was love."" 
 Ethan sees Brynne as his safe harbor, and his comfort from his inner turmoil and PTSD. The alternating POV's work perfectly here and kept me turning the pages late into the night. 
 Raine Miller writes THE most amazing sex scenes, without being cliche or overdone. Of course her characters have a deep connection after all they have been through together, but it is still vital that I feel emotionally connected, too, and I absolutely felt connected to Ethan and Brynne. Ethan is still battling his inner demons, and Brynne must still contend with characters from her painful past. Nothing in the story is rushed, nothing is as expected, and all is brought to an incredibly satisfying conclusion in Rare and Precious Things. A must read!

Blair has written yet another extremely gripping and powerful story, covering the events surrounding Candace's trauma but told from Ryan's POV. I am a big fan of the male POV so this book was right up my alley even though it deals with some highly sensitive subjects. If you have read the first two books in the Fading series (which I highly recommend), then you know that these books tackle some very tough issues including rape and its aftermath. Falling is beautifully and emotionally written and even includes a healthy dose of romance and steamy scenes. Ryan's personality has been shaped by extreme violence in his past, and we get some insight into the initially cold-hearted SOB that he was before he met Candace. Parts of this book are very difficult to read but the main characters all grow and change and find some measure of peace by the conclusion of the story. The author has written a fabulous ending that did not disappoint. I loved this book and highly recommend the entire Fading series.

 Georgia buys a beach house at the Carolina shore and plans to spend the summer renovating the house into a possible bed and breakfast. She leaves Washington D.C. and her longtime boyfriend, Kyle. 
 At the beach, she meets the very sexy Tristan and fights their attraction because of her relationship with Kyle. This might sound a little predictable, but it's not. Tristan makes her question whether she should sacrifice true love for the sake of others. Georgia, on the other hand, is loyal to Kyle, and believes love is not worth anything if you hurt others to be together. 
 ""I want to be with you. I can't get you out of my head."" 
 Of course, Tristan is super-hot and the story is full of MEGA-steamy scenes, plus plenty of emotion. Will Georgia stay with Kyle or will she follow her heart and let Tristan love her? 
 ""I want you, all of you, Georgia. And I want you to want me too."" 
 No spoilers but the title hints that a tragedy has occurred, and the events surrounding this incident are explained near the end of the story. This life-altering event also sheds light on Georgia's sometimes-aggravating actions during the story. 
 In keeping with a discussion I had with one of my favorite authors at Book Bash, I am keeping this review SHORT and TO THE POINT! Did we like this book? Yes! Do we recommend it? Yes! It is a great summer read, and will keep you turning the pages to the very end.

 This book was a totally unexpected read! 
 As a fan of Tara Sivec's ""Chocolate Lovers"" series, I was completely surprised by the very emotional tone of WATCH OVER ME. The author takes you through every painful step of Addison's troubled journey in her attempts to recover from her mother's death as well as deal with her father's alcohol addiction. She must also bear the burden of managing her family's bakery business. She struggles through each day and barely holds things together. 
 Addison then meets the wonderful Zander, and it seems as if she is finally learning to work through her grief. He accepts her unconditionally, emotional problems and all. Addison is also receiving counseling, which seems to be helping her live a full and normal life. Then the author throws in a few major plot twists which will totally surprise you! 
 The story caught me completely off guard and I absolutely loved the direction the author took with this book. Do not read any reviews with spoilers; it's best if you read this book without knowing too much detail about the plot!

 I'll admit it. Even though I am addicted to reading, sometimes I get a little jaded...And then a book like Tangled comes along, and BAM! Just like that, I'm addicted to reading again. Seriously, a book that cites Braveheart, the Borg, an NYU sex study and frogs? I'm in. 
 Tangled is one of the most original books I have ever read. Told from the main male character Drew's POV, the very talented author gives the reader a peek into how guys really feel and think: 
 ""Every healthy man in the world wakes up with a stiffy. A fatty. Morning wood. I'm sure there's some medical explanation for the phenomenon, but I just like to think of it as a little present from God."" 
 Drew is insanely attractive, smart, hard-working and very wealthy. Sounds cliche, right? In the hands of this talented author, Drew is one of the most memorable and original characters I have ever encountered! I love Drew's inner monologues. They are both hysterically funny and very, very touching. He's a self-confessed womanizer who meets his match in the very smart and gorgeous Kate Brooks. He falls hard for Kate and all his old rules about women and dating fly out the window. 
 ""Women fall in love quicker than men. Easier and more often. But when guys fall? We go down harder. And when things go bad? When it's not us who ends it? We don't get to walk away. 
 We crawl. "" 
 The author has described the genre of Tangled as ""Comedic Erotica"" and ""Funny Smut."" Both phrases describe this book to a tee. It is both hilarious and very, very intense. I started reading this book past midnight and did not want to put it down. Seriously, it's that addictive. Don't waste time reading this review. Start reading Tangled. You will absolutely fall in love with Drew!

 Nina Lane continues to enchant and delight in the second book in the Spiral of Bliss series! What can be said to add to the many 5-star reviews for Allure, other than to say it is a must-read? The author has once again crafted a deeply erotic and romantic storyline that will keep you turning the pages well into the wee hours of the morning. 
 Allure picks up where Arouse left off. (Since there is a surprise at the end of Arouse, I absolutely recommend that you read Arouse first.) Once again, the author uses a dual POV that switches seamlessly between Olivia and Dean. And once again, Ms. Lane knocks it out of the park with the sex scenes! Just when you think you have read it all before, along comes a book like Allure to show you just how stunningly beautiful erotica can be. 
 Allure reveals more about the development of Dean and Liv's relationship, told in flashbacks woven into the current story. He was very careful with her in the beginning and always treated her as a treasure. 
 ""Be with me, Liv,"" he said. ""Just be with me."" 
 Liv fell hard for the professor, despite the barriers she had erected to protect herself: 
 ""I was crazy about him. I loved the way he invested everything with such purpose, the way he focused his attention on me and really listened when I talked."" 
 ""I move closer to him and tuck my face into the juncture of his shoulder. Breathe in the scent of his skin. Feel his heart beating against my palm."" 
 Dean and Olivia must travel to California due to a family crisis, and it is there that many of the crucial events in the book unfold. We meet Dean's family and Helen, his former wife. The author does an amazing job of introducing all of these characters and filling in Dean's backstory. (No spoilers, but there is one character that I feel is very misunderstood and who I would LOVE to see get their own book!) 
 Dean and Liv are deeply connected and very much in love, but will their relationship be strong enough to withstand the several distressing events that occur in Allure? There is an absolutely incredible storyline that will leave you wanting much, much more. I am anxiously awaiting the continuation of Dean and Liv's story in Awaken. 
 Allure is a must-read, don't miss out!

 Wanderlust is one of our top books of 2013! I am a big fan of dark erotica so the author's warning and the subject matter did not scare me away, and you shouldn't shy away from this story either! The author has crafted a heart-wrenching tale of pain, survival and love that will leave you wanting much more of Evie and Hunter's story. 
 Can love come from pain? This is the theme of Wanderlust. Our heroine Evie is running away from a painful past and searching for emotional and physical freedom while on a trek across the U.S. to see Niagra Falls. Hunter is a trucker and let's just say they have a fateful encounter while on the open road. Is Hunter a monster? I don't think so, and in fact, I LOVED his character. Will Evie find the freedom she is seeking? Read the story and you will find out. 
 Ms. Warren has created two richly-drawn characters that haunted me long after I finished their story. I was immediately drawn into Evie and Hunter's lives and I felt a deep connection with them from the beginning of the story. That connection is essential to me as a reader and that is why I feel so strongly about this story and the author. 
 No spoilers here. Suffice it to say the storyline is absolutely surprising and incredibly fulfilling. The sex scenes in this book are disturbing, graphic and very, very satisfying.

Katy Evans has written Remy Tate as the ultimate passionate and raw Alpha male, with Brooke as his willing and devoted woman. I found Mine to be even more sensually-charged than Real, more sexual and more erotic. Remy is hot, he is hard, and he is filled with love and protectiveness for Brooke. This is an intense love story above all, and the burning sex between these two will have you needing a cold shower (or ice!) to cool down. Do I judge a book by its cover?

Of course my favorite parts of the book are the hot sexy times between Ty and Zane and the sometimes humorous banter between them. Abigail Roux writes some deliciously steamy scenes and I wanted more, more, more! All of the characters are well-developed and it seems like the focus might be on Nick and Kelly later.

 Ash is HOT and actually a very loving man. But Mason also captures Scarlett's heart, and Ambrosia explores Scarlett's emotional and sexual awakening. Will she choose Ash or Mason? No spoilers here but I will say her behavior and choices were sometimes very aggravating! 
 Ambrosia is filled with lots of missed opportunities, a few misunderstandings, and oh yeah, LOTS of super-steamy sex scenes. 
 Erin Noelle writes a very captivating story in Ambrosia with lots of very memorable characters. This is a great book for those who enjoy a somewhat angsty story where the plot is not wrapped up with a tidy little bow. I am very much looking forward to the next installment in this series!

 4 1/2 blissful stars! Finally an erotic novel where the marriage IS the story, not just an epilogue 
 ""One day I'm going to touch you in a thousand different ways and show you how to touch me,"" he said. And he did. 
 Struggling with a tormented past, undergraduate Olivia Winter once led a practical but isolated life. Then she met Professor Dean West, a brilliant scholar of medieval history who melted Liv's inhibitions and taught her the meaning of both love and erotic pleasure. But after three years of a blissful, lusty marriage, Liv and Dean now face a crisis that threatens everything they believe about each other. And when dark secrets and temptations rise to the surface, the fallout might break them apart forever. 
 Nina Lane gives us two very relatable characters in Olivia and Dean. Her writing is superb and the story kept me reading furiously until the end. And did I mention that I am in love with Professor Dean West? He is a totally hot alpha male, who is also an intelligent and very well-respected university professor. 
 ""Liv,"" he said, his voice rough with tenderness, "" you don't have to be afraid."" 
 ""Why not?"" 
 ""Because I'll slay monsters for you."" 
 Arouse gives us a candid peek into the inner workings of a once-perfect marriage between two somewhat damaged people. Olivia had a troubled childhood which left her scarred in many ways. Dean is her first love, slightly older and very, very sexy. He literally sweeps her off her feet. Something comes between them and they both must struggle with their own emotions as they deal with how these events will affect their marriage and their very tight bond. 
 ""I love him to my bones, but suddenly I'm wondering what I might have been without him."" 
 I am not sure why the ""married couple"" theme has been mentioned as not being everyone's cup of tea. Olivia and Dean have an intense sexual relationship and Ms. Lane knows how to write erotic scenes that will knock your socks off! I also loved reading Dean's POV after the mid-point of the book, it was a refreshing switch and gave me a lot of insight into his behavior during the first part of the book. 
 ""I'll be here, beauty. Waiting for you."" 
 This was my first book by Nina Lane. I absolutely love her writing style. Arouse is a brilliantly-written look into the inner workings of a real relationship. I LOVE Olivia and Dean and can't wait to dive right into Allure!",Tue Apr 02 23:10:36 -0700 2013,Sun May 05 09:12:56 -0700 2013,Sun May 05 09:12:56 -0700 2013,Thu May 02 00:00:00 -0700 2013,3,1

 Summary: 
 A fallen boxer. 
 A woman with a broken dream. 
 A competition... 
 He even makes me forget my name. One night was all it took, and I forgot everything and anything except the sexy fighter in the ring who sets my mind ablaze and my body on fire with wanting... 
 Remington Tate is the strongest, most confusing man I've ever met in my life. 
 He's the star of the dangerous underground fighting circuit, and I'm drawn to him as I've never been drawn to anything in my life. I forget who I am, what I want, with just one look from him. When he's near, I need to remind myself that I am strong-but he is stronger. And now it's my job to keep his body working like a perfect machine, his taut muscles primed and ready to break the bones of his next opponents . . . 
 But the one he's most threatening to, now, is me. 
 I want him. I want him without fear. Without reservations. 
 If only I knew for sure what it is that he wants from me?

 Review: 
 ""Remington Tate is everything I've never, ever done..."" 
 Not sure why I decided to give this new author a try, but I am so glad I did! I immediately fell in love with both Brooke and Remy. Real is a great debut novel from Katy Evans. Remington ""Riptide"" Tate will steal your heart right from the beginning. He is a brute of a man, an athlete, competitor and superstar underground fighter with a huge following. He desperately wants Brooke Dumas to see him for the real person that he is, serious problems and all. Brooke has her own issues, but really knows and understands the thrill of sports competition. 
 ""He wants to be my real, not my adventure."" 
 Remy and Brooke's attraction is instant but its a slow burn leading up to the first time they get together: 
 ""My panties are soaked, and my pulse has gone haywire. I've never 
 condoned violence. This isn't me, and I blink in stupefaction at the 
 sensations whipping through my system. Lust, pure white-hot lust, 
 flutters through my nerve endings."" 
 I don't want to give away any spoilers so I will just say that this story has a great twist that hooked me in right from the beginning. I read this book quickly but at the same time did not want it to end. Loved the Epilogue and hope to see more of these characters from Ms. Evans. 
 ""And I'd give up forever to touch you... 
 Cause I know that you feel me somehow... 
 You're the closest to heaven that I've ever been and I don't want to 
 go home right now. 
 I want you to know who I am."" 
 Thank you, Ms. Evans, for introducing us to Remy. Can't wait for more.

 ""What makes a hero is the one that's left standing when the others are dead. Or the one that gave his life so the others could live. That's a fuckin' hero."" 
 Midnight Soul is the conclusion of the Fantasyland series with Noctorno (Noc) Hawthorne and Franka Drakkar, who was truly evil in the previous books in this series. But in trademark Kristen Ashley style, Franka's true side is shown and all of her secrets are revealed. She has endured terrible abuse for years to protect her brother and his family which she has hidden from everyone around her. 
 Not and Franka begin a very slow-burn romance that at first begins as a friendship and partnership. Kristen Ashley expertly weaves fantasy, paranormal and reality with touches of comedy and as always, a beautiful and enduring romance. The scenes of Franka and others from her world being introduced to the modern world are funny and thought-provoking and always entertaining. 
 Noc sees the real Franka and his love transforms her. I always tell friends who don't usually read fantasy that Kristen Ashley's books are magical and engrossing and Midnight Soul is no exception. The journey that Franka takes is filled with forgiveness and redemption and yes, a swoony Alpha who will stop at nothing to protect Franka and her loved ones. 
 Midnight Soul is an imaginative and sexy conclusion to the Fantasyland series. It is filled with unforgettable characters and as always, a magnificent Epilogue! 
 ""You don't have a midnight soul, Frannie. Your soul is so bright, I look too close, I'd be blinded.""

Jack is also very witty and totally HOT and is very much in love with the much-older Grace. 
 The ""dark forces"" of stardom and fame start to pull Jack and Grace apart. Her star is on the rise, as he falls in with the wrong crowd and succumbs to the pressures of life in Hollywood. I could not put this book down, and absolutely loved Alice Clayton's writing, filled with wit, warmth and SUPER steamy sex scenes! This book is funny, well-written and fast-paced.

 Aly and Jared were inseparable as kids until a monumental event occurred that changed their lives forever. Jared has now reunited with Aly and her older brother Christopher but he is the classic tortured bad boy, full of pent-up anger and unresolved feelings. Aly cannot resist Jared and their scenes together are breathtaking. They share a history together, making their relationship all the more deeper and meaningful.

Jacob is actually a very nice guy and there really are no bad people in this book, unless you judge Sam for her unfaithfulness to her husband. I did find some of her behavior towards the end of the book to be a little mean-spirited, but the author justifies Sam's actions in the end.

 This is NOT just a simple retelling of Hopeless! Colleen Hoover once again weaves an emotionally powerful, often painful and always beautiful story that you will not be able to put down. Seeing the events of Hopeless from Holder's point of view, the reader is given insight into the circumstances surrounding certain tragic events from Hopeless and also into Holder's actions in Hopeless. 
 This will be spoiler-free for those who have not yet read Hopeless and because this is being written prior to release day. If you think there is nothing new that can be written about Holder and Sky's story, you are wrong! Losing Hope is an incredibly sensitive (and very sexy!) book written by a masterful storyteller. Ms. Hoover has actually made me fall more in love with Holder than I already was! 
 They're so perfect,"" I say. ""Like hearts. I could literally stare at your lips for days and never get bored."" - Holder 
 You will be emotionally drained after reading Losing Hope but it feels oh so good. Make no mistake, this is a heart-wrenching story. But there are no extraneous characters in this story, and no weak plot points. Every character and every event is perfectly meaningful and necessary. 
 ""My attention is constantly homed in on her like I'm a compass and she's my North."" - Holder 
 You should definitely read Hopeless first because it is amazing story. With that being said, you will love Losing Hope if you are a fan of Hopeless because it is a passionate, fresh and lyrical story.

She plans an elaborate scheme to trick her way into the inner circle of Travis, the criminal she blames for her life of pain. She focuses her attention on Javier as part of her scheme, but she most certainly does not plan on falling in love. 
 Simple story, right? In the hands of Karina Halle, it becomes a rich story of lust, of love and loss, sin and redemption, and trust and betrayal. 
 Ellie thinks she is control of her emotions but she falls fast and hard for Javier, and who wouldn't? He is handsome, protective, and worships Ellie. He is also a member of a violent drug cartel. 
 ""I want your heart, your soul and your body. I want the you that you're hiding deep inside. I must have her."" - Javier 
 ""I need you, my Angel. And I'll do anything and everything to keep you."" - Javier 
 ""He wasn't good and he wasn't bad. He was just Javier. And he was mine."" - Ellie 
 Ms. Halle has created some very memorable characters that will get under your skin and into your heart. I dreaded the ending of the book and can't wait for Ellie's story to continue in Shooting Scars (The Artists Trilogy #2) (expected May 13, 2013). 
 On Every Street is a prequel to Sins & Needles, but is itself a stand-alone story. You do not need to read Sins & Needles first. (But read it, it is one of my favorite books!)

 Step outside your comfort zone and take a trip to Sector Four with The Beyond series by Kit Rocha. I never imagined a dystopic series could be so gripping, erotic, gritty and thoroughly surprising as these books by Kit Rocha. Although the authors tried to create a standalone with Beyond Jealousy, and it definitely can be read on its own, you will miss the rich background stories on the other characters in this book and I recommend picking this series up from the beginning. 
 Ace, Rachel and Cruz are the heart of BEYOND JEALOUSY and we are treated to a SIZZLING menage between these three very different and stubborn characters. I have always said you don't know Alpha until you meet an O'Kane, and Cruz and Ace are no exceptions. This is a world of graphic sex, unbridled pleasure, strong women and free-flowing booze. 
 This is a surprisingly emotional story as we get to delve into the insecurities and passions forming this incredible threesome. Kit Rocha writes some of the most intense, erotic and steamy sex scenes I have ever read, and BEYOND JEALOUSY is no exception! Rachel, Cruz and Ace form one memorable menage that I will not soon forget! 
 ""It wouldn't be a f****d-up triangle if they met in the middle. It would be straight-up f*****g."" 
 These three really care about each other and that forms the heart of the story. I highly recommend BEYOND JEALOUSY as well as the entire BEYOND series. Dystopia doesn't sound half bad with the like of the O'Kane men (and women!) around.

 There is nothing more exciting for a reader than to pick up a new book by an unfamiliar author and be totally swept away. Beyond Shame might be the most sexually charged book I have ever read and I loved every minute. 
 Noelle's discovery that she can be totally free, sexually and otherwise, in Sector Four makes for some thrilling reading. Beyond Shame is like a Kristen Ashley story on crack. The men are hot, they are sexy and the sex scenes are like nothing I have ever read. Even getting inked turns into an erotic experience for Noelle. 
 Loved the dystopic storyline and that the female characters are free to make their own choices. Jasper and Noelle are unforgettable characters.

Before you read any further, you MUST first read Sins & Needles (Book #1) or the novella On Every Street before Shooting Scars. Both books provide a rich and detailed look into the minds and motivations of the three main characters, Ellie, Camden and Javier. 
 With that said, buckle up, because Shooting Scars is one hell of a ride. Shooting Scars plunges back into the action right where Sins & Needles ended. Ellie and Camden are thrown into an impossible situation which leaves Ellie back with Javier, the former love of her life. Does she hate him? Does she love him? All is revealed in painfully beautiful detail in Shooting Scars. 
 Ellie, Cam and Javier are all incredibly complicated characters. What I love about Karina Halle's writing is that there is no black and white, no good or evil, no angels or demons (in my opinion). Each character has their own complex motivations for their behavior, and Karina refreshingly lets the reader form their own opinions about the characters. I don't want to describe the plot in detail here because Shooting Scars is a very intricate tale that is best enjoyed fresh. 
 Shooting Scars is filled with lots of action, romance and twists and turns. Is it painful? Hell, yes. And that is why it is such an amazing story. My problem? I need Bold Tricks like, yesterday.

Her books make my heart pound, get my pulse racing, make me cry, make me laugh and wrap me, always, in a cocoon of family, friendship and love. Could you ask anything more from a writer? And Wild And Free, the third installment in the Three Series, does all of that, and much, much more. 
 Wild and Free contains some of the rawest, animalistic, sensual and gorgeous love scenes I have ever read. Abel and Lilah, destined to be mates for life, need to be able to draw you in to their characters and their fated mating for this to be a believable story. And boy, do they ever! Just when I think Ms. Ashley could not possibly create a more Alpha male than she already has, she writes Abel, who is a hybrid and who mates like nobody's business!! 
 This book contains everything you could possibly hope for in a paranormal romance. There is incredible, heart-stopping action, hot sex, other-wordly beings, super-hot sex, wolves, vampires and heart-pounding sex! I absolutely loved Abel and his story broke my heart. Lilah is a kick-ass heroine, brave, uninhibited, sexual. loyal and loving. These two together just might save the world. 
 I could not put this book down and was literally swooning at every page. Even if you are not a big fan of paranormal romance, and I do not read a lot of them, Wild And Free is a MUST-READ. This book is truly Kristen Ashley at her finest. She is not afraid to pull the punches and make sacrifices when they work for the story. And for that, I love her. Be prepared to be wowed. Wild And Free has loads of unexpected twists and turns and it is a vital addition to your KA library!!

The characters of ""Sabian"" and Jocelyn are well-developed, there is plot and tension, and there are totally thrilling and HOT sex scenes. This was a completely surprising and fantastic book for me. I could not put it down. My heart broke a little during this book because of the predicament of the two main characters.

I could not get enough of Gabriel and Julianne and re-read both Gabriel's Inferno and Gabriel's Rapture several times when they were first released. 
 Gabriel's Redemption, the third book in the series, is immensely satisfying and stunningly written. Even descriptions of simple acts such as eating or studying take on rich and layered meanings when written by Sylvain Reynard. And the love scenes between Gabriel and his beloved Julia took my breath away. 
 ""In the months since their marriage, their desire had not abated, nor had the sweetness of their coupling. All speech melted into motion and touch and the bliss of physical love."" 
 This story takes place shortly after their marriage and shows the struggles that Gabriel and Julia -- like most couples -- must go through while building a life together. Will Gabriel overcome the guilt he feels about his past? Will Julia be able to reconcile Gabriel's burning desire to start a family with her own educational ambitions? She, too, feels guilt and conflicting emotions over Gabriel's plans for their future together. 
 ""Gabriel was a consuming fire. His passion, his desires, all seemed to overtake the desires of those around him. He'd told her once that she was the only woman who'd ever said no to him. He was probably correct."" 
 Sylvain Reynard weaves in many Old Testament references which enrich the love story between Gabriel and Julia. Nicely balanced with the heavy themes of love, forgiveness and redemption are the funny comments by the Snarky Narrator, which lend an air of levity to the book. 
 The secondary characters that I love also make appearances in this book. Professor Picton is a strong influence on Julia and helps to guide her in making certain life-altering decisions including dealing with the evil Christa, who is still out to make trouble for the Emersons. We also see a glimpse into Paul Norris' life and the dangerous Simon and Natalie also make appearances. 
 Gabriel's devotion to Julia remains unwavering and I loved reading their scenes together. He still battles with feelings of inadequacy but Julia's goodness helps him overcome his deep-seated feelings of guilt and self-loathing. 
 ""Almost six months into their marriage he loved her more than before, he envied the very air she breathed."" 
 I also loved the way in which Julia grew as a person in this book, and became much stronger in her educational studies and in dealing with her professors and others who conspire against her. She also stands up to Gabriel, who is certainly a force to be reckoned with. Gabriel, too, grows as a person as he uncovers facts about his past that help him find closure to certain events in his life and bring him some measure of peace. 
 ""I suppose we're all on our own spiritual journeys."" 
 ""Some of us are further along than others."" 
 Sylvain Reynard did a spectacular job of concluding Julia and Gabriel's story in this book. Once again, Sylvain delivers a richly detailed and deeply-felt story that will stay with you long after you finish the last word. I was sobbing at the sheer beauty of this book and can't wait to read more from Sylvain Reynard.

She and Scott and very drawn to each other and Emma tries to fight her intense attraction to him. Scott is a HOT musician but has a very sweet and loving side to him. This is not your typical YA book and contains some very emotional, angsty scenes and some very thrilling sex between Emma and Scott. Definitely a sequel coming based on the ending.

 Elle Aycart, where have you been all my life? I couldn't put this book down. Ms. Aycart gives us very well-written characters in Tate and James. (And guess what, James has BROTHERS! More Bowen brothers, please!) James is sexy, gorgeous, tattooed, and everything that Tate thinks she needs to run away from. But wouldn't you know it, James is SEXY and LOVING and he waits patiently (sort of) for Tate to come to her senses. 
 Tate and James ""meet cute"" in a Florida retirement community and agree they will get together JUST for sex. But they fall hard for each other, and Tate runs scared. This book had elements of Kristen Ashley which I loved. Intense sexual attraction, HOT ALPHA MALE who wants to protect his woman, and a storyline that leaves Tate in danger. 
 This book is about two people with serious relationship issues and ultimately a story about heartbreak, healing and trust. 
 This book is VERY EXPLICIT and the sex scenes are TOTALLY HOT. James is intense, controlling and I loved every minute. 
 James 
 I highlighted so many passages in this book but here are some of my favorites: 
 ""When he regained his senses, his throat felt raw, his mind foggy, and he wasn't sure if his legs would work again-ever. What the fuck had happened? Had she killed him?"" - James 
 ""He felt feverish, out of control, famished, like he'd been waiting for this for ages. There weren't going to be any fancy moves from him. Just stark-naked hunger."" - James 
 ""It amazed her how giving James was. He didn't seem afraid of anything; he was so sure of her it scared the living shit out of her."" - Tate

 UNEXPECTED 5 STAR READ 
 Very few books draw me in like Up in the Air, All In, Gabriel's Inferno, Bared To You, etc., but this book did. After reading This Man earlier in January, it was hard to find characters and a storyline that would keep me up all night, but thanks to Georgia Cates, I now have Laurelyn and Jack. This story had me riveted from the first page when Jack proposes an unusual arrangement to Laurelyn upon her arrival for a 3 month summer visit to Australia. She accepts and they embark on a HOT relationship. I won't call it a romance because neither one agrees to that, at least at first. 
 I loved the Australian setting but I will admit I had to look up a few slang words. 
 Sanger- sandwich 
 Oldies - parents 
 Coldie - beer 
 Brekkie - breakfast 
 Favorite quotes: 
 ""You treat me like I'm somebody instead of a nobody."" 
 ""I've been wanting to devour this mouth since the first time I saw you."" 
 ""Jack, you don't always know the true worth of a woman's love until it becomes a memory."" 
 There is a cliffhanger ending, of course, but the author treats us to a delicious Prologue. The sex between Jack and Laurelyn is super HOT but I really felt a connection between the two, thanks to Ms. Cates' writing. More Jack please!

 SYNOPSIS: 
 Ellie Watt is used to starting over. The daughter of a grifting team, Ellie spent her childhood being used as a pawn in her parents' latest scam. Now she's much older, wiser and ready to give her con artist life a rest. But returning to the dry desert town of Palm Valley, California means one more temptation than she bargained for - Camden McQueen. Once known as the high school weirdo, Camden is bigger and badder than the boy he used to be and a talented tattoo artist with his own thriving business. Ellie's counting on Camden still being in love with her but what she's not counting on is how easily unrequited love can turn into obsession over time. When Camden discovers Ellie's plan to con him, he makes her a deal she doesn't dare refuse, but her freedom comes with a price and it's one that takes both Ellie and Camden down a dangerous road. 
 I wish I could do justice to this book but I am not eloquent enough. This is a stunning story that will break your heart, thrill you and leave you wanting much, much more. 
 It is difficult to write a review of this book without giving away any of the major plot twists. Karina Halle is a very gifted storyteller with an incredibly sensitive voice. I stayed up very, very late to finish this book. I could not wait to see what path Ellie and Camden would take. And oh yeah, there is some very graphic and steamy sex. 
 It is very gratifying to find an author who can surprise and thrill with such a great story. 
 There is a very satisfying cliffhanger (you'll see what I mean!) and thankfully more books planned in this series. A prequel novella, On Every Street, is coming on March 12th, featuring the ""torrid love story"" of Ellie and Javier. Shooting Scars (TAT #2) is coming May 13th, 2013

 Hanna Boudreaux has lived in the small town of Willow all her life. She's sweet, cute and quiet. 
 Hanna has a moment of epiphany when she realizes her crush for forever, Raiden Ulysses Miller, is not ever going to be hers. She sees her life as narrow and decides to do something about it. 
 Raiden Miller is the town's local hero. A former Marine with the medal to prove his hero status, he comes home, shrouded in mystery. It takes a while, but eventually Hanna catches his eye. 
 After all these years of Raid and Hanna living in the same town, the question is why? Is Raid interested in Hanna because she's sweet and cute? Or does Raid have something else going on? 
 OUR REVIEW 
 We have had a love affair with all things Kristen Ashley since we first read Knight last year. Yes, Knight was our first foray into Kit's world, and we have never looked back. We have read almost every single one of Ms. Ashley's books. Each of her series are highly recommended. Our blog is new so we have not posted all of our reviews yet but we can discuss each character at length, and yes, we have read every Rock Chick book. You can imagine our excitement when we were selected to receive an ARC of RAID. We could not believe it! 
 Who can resist a book that even had us highlighting the Author's Note? 
 ""I have many heart's desires and one of them is the slim chance that my books will guide women to accepting themselves as they are, having confidence in their bodies, brains and beauty and letting all that poison go so they can enjoy their lives, including sexually. 
 ROCK ON, KRISTEN! 
 We would like to think that there is a litte bit of Ms. Ashley in the character of Hanna. She is sweet, she is cute, she is trusting, she has a cat, she hand-knits afghans for a living and she lives in a small town. She has been crushing on Raiden Miller since she was a young girl. When he returns to town a war hero, and he finally notices her, her whole world is turned upside down. Of course, this would not be a proper Unfinished Hero book without a lot of danger, a lot of graphic sex and one HOT ALPHA MALE. You get all that and more with RAID. We confess that we re-read KNIGHT and CREED in one day while in the middle of reading RAID. 
 Favorite Quotes: 
 ""Prefer to be with a woman who's cute and shy and obviously into me. Means I can save time and get straight to shit that matters."" - Raid 
 ""I'd crawled across a room for Raiden Miller. And it was him, not me, who stopped it because I didn't like it. Which made me look back and like it."" - Hanna 
 Hanna is Raid's reward. 
 We loved this book and would have loved a little more interaction with the other unfinished heroes who appear in this story (this is a stand-alone book but you should read KNIGHT and CREED in that order). With that said, where can we find us a Raiden Ulysses Miller?

 What's not to love about Ally Nightingale? She's tough, she's smart, and she feels everything right down to her bones: 
 ""Backing up a bit, my name is Allyson Nightingale, but everyone calls me Ally. 
 And I'm a Rock Chick, in name and deed."" 
 YES! Everything we absolutely love about the Rock Chick series is packed right into the last installment: gorgeous, real women, hot Alpha heroes and SUPER hot sex! And of course, like the previous Rock Chick stories, Ally vehemently denies her true feelings for the gorgeous Ren, but lucky for Ally (and us!), he knows what he wants, and what Ally wants (and needs), too! 
 ""I don't fight fair, baby. I fight to win."" 
 ""And not one of them looked like you look when I slide inside you, every fucking time I slide inside you. Like a piece of you has been lost and now it's found."" 
 Ally and Ren are TOTALLY hot together! And the storyline is pure Kristen Ashley, pure emotion, lots of action, some danger, a few misunderstandings, but above all, lots of strong, hot men and lots of strong, gorgeous women! All of our beloved characters make an appearance in Rock Chick Revolution and there's even a very familiar name (*cough*cough) thrown around. 
 I laughed a lot and I started crying at the introduction. The road to Ally and Ren's HEA was a bumpy one but of course it ends in pure beauty and perfection, as only KA can do: 
 ""Because when I had to be a badass all day and cases got tough and I came home, or when life just sucked, or when life was awesome and going along fine, I knew this was what Ren Zano would give me. 
 Always. 
 Exactly what I needed.""

 Please don't shy away from this book due to the war-time setting. Wounded is an emotional, satisfying story of two souls brought together by the harsh realities of war. 
 Rania is a beautiful Iraqi woman who had to resort to prostitution at a very young age in order to simply survive. She is shut down emotionally until by chance she meets Hunter, an American fighting in Iraq. They cannot communicate at first due to the language barrier but learn to communicate in other ways. 
 ""He is asleep. So handsome. I do not understand what is happening to me. From the first moment I saw him, something in him called to my blood and made it sing."" - Rania 
 Ms. Wilder delivers some very lush and explicit sex scenes between Rania and Hunter which were an unexpected surprise. 
 ""Rania. Her name is music. Her eyes are veiled pools of expression. She hides behind anger, behind toughness. It's all an act. I see the pain. See the fear. See the need. She's lonely. She hates what she does. "" - Hunter

Through a series of incidences told through flashbacks (which we loved, by the way), Marie is taken as collateral by Horse, a member of the Reaper's Motorcycle Club. 
 There is a lot more to Horse than his bad-ass persona. We really loved how Ms. Wylde describes the inner workings of a MC. Not sure if it's all accurate but boy is it interesting! They have their own code of ethics and do not operate like the rest of the ""civilian"" world. This is a rough book and um, it's not exactly a traditional ""romance"".

I was even more surprised to be immediately drawn inside the sensitive, loving and intense head of Travis ""Mad Dog"" Maddox. Walking Disaster contains no surprise story lines; it is the story of Beautiful Disaster told from the POV of Travis. You do not need to have read Beautiful Disaster first, but I highly recommend that you do, in order to understand some of the nuances of the story and the characters. 
 Travis is loving, he is sexy, he is kind, he is sensitive and he is very, very caring. Yes, it's true! Jamie McGuire has created a wonderful caring male character who will become the new book boyfriend to lots of fans. 
 Travis and his family lost their beloved mother at a young age. Her last words to Travis were, ""One of these days you're going to fall in love, son. Don't settle for just anyone. Choose the girl that doesn't come easy; the one you have to fight for, and then never stop fighting. Never stop fighting for what you want."" 
 These words serve Travis well when he meets his match in Abby ""Pidge"" Abernathy. 
 Travis knows immediately that Abby is very different from the endless parade of girls that he has been with. He is aware of his bad-boy reputation, but in his mind, he has always been nothing but totally honest with every girl he has ever been with: 
 ""She was my opposite: innocent on the surface, and damaged deep within."" 
 I was a little frustrated at Abby's stubbornness in constantly pushing Travis away, emotionally and physically, but smart and sexy-ass Travis takes his mother's advice and fights hard for Abby! 
 ""I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed. It turns out it wasn't something about you at all. It was just you."" 
 I love a book with an alternate POV, so Walking Disaster fit the bill for me. I enjoyed reading the Las Vegas and fighting scenes from Travis' POV. You will not believe what an intelligent, caring and loyal character Travis is. 
 Finally, the author also treats us to a wonderfully surprising and satisfying Epilogue that I can only hope will lead to much more Travis and Abby!

 This book has haunted me since I finished. Emily, Gavin and Dillon really got under my skin. I so wanted for Emily to leave her boyfriend Dillon and be with Gavin, with whom she felt an instant attraction the moment they met. But she felt bound to Dillon and he uses every narcissistic trick in the book to keep her. Emily's confusion over her feelings for Dillon are at first understandable - he did help her through some very tough times - but then I found myself yelling at her to leave Dillon and be with Gavin! 
 The sex scenes I this book are really really hot but I wish there had been more! I don't want to give away any spoilers but I did enjoy catching a glimpse into what a relationship with a true narcissist might be like . My heart broke a few times during this book, it was a much darker read than I originally expected. There is a doozy of a cliffhanger and I can't wait to see how this story concludes.

 LOVED THIS BOOK. 
 Holy hell, the sex is hot! It comes early, it comes fast and it comes HARD. Pun intended. It's interesting that some reviewers looked at this as a negative but the fact that Chloe and Bennett have sex almost at the beginning of this book is very much a part of the narrative. They then work backwards and develop their relationship and emotional connection from there. I couldn't put this book down. I might be one of the three people in the world who did not read The Office but apparently there are some major differences between the original Twilight fanfic and Beautiful Bastard. 
 I loved how Bennett and Chloe were loved and respected by everyone else but they could not seem tone be civil towards at each other. Also loved the back and forth POV's between the two characters. 
 This book is not for everyone but it is a treat worth reading. I can't wait for more of Bennett and Chloe!

 The Stranger is very sexy and suspenseful. I read it in just one night (pun intended). I was expecting a carbon copy of Fifty Shades or Bared to You, but this book is different. The book is told from the POV of Kasie who has a fling in Las Vegas with a very handsome stranger. Circumstances later bring them together again, which leads to Kasie being torn between being a.""good girl"" or following her heart. 
 This book includes some very steamy sex scenes and one very hot guy, Mr Dade. I can't wait to learn more about him in the next book because this one is told from Kasie's POV and ends rather abruptly on a huge cliff-hanger. Kasie's actions might disturb some readers, because you are told from the beginning that she has a boyfriend but I felt the author did a good job of explaining Kasie's thought process.

Poughkeepsie is one of my favorite books, a beautiful, romantic and yes, sometimes violent story of true love, loyalty, goodness and family. It is a must-read, and the kind of book and characters that stay with you forever. So when I heard that Debra Anastasia planned to write a second book about Beckett Taylor, I could not wait to read it! Beckett is violent, damaged, loving, loyal and sexy -- in short, my favorite kind of (anti) hero. Beckett is in love with the equally-damaged Eve and Return to Poughkeepsie is their story. 
 Beckett is admittedly ""the scariest motherfucker in Poughkeespie."" He makes a decision early in this book that breaks the hearts of all those who love him. Eve is the love of his life, and um, they have some incredible chemistry: 
 ""You're mine now. You gave up. Know that you could have killed me. Now nothing will stop me."" 
 Despite their love for each other, Beckett feels that he must redeem himself as a person and become a man worthy of Eve and his family's love. No real spoilers here but the author then takes us on a wild ride for the rest of the story, filled with incredibly memorable characters (hello, handsome cop!), very twisted criminals and tender and heartbreaking family scenes. My loves Blake and Livia are prominent in this book as are Cole and Kyle. But the focus of the story is on Beckett and his love, Eve. 
 Eve is one kick-ass heroine and she really holds her own throughout this story. Although I absolutely loved her scenes with Beckett, I also really loved Ryan, the very sexy Poughkeepsie cop who, in another lifetime, could have been someone Eve fell for. (Could there be a spin-off here? Hmmm, let's hope so!) Eve becomes involved in a very complicated crime scheme that ultimately involves the entire clan and leads to some real nail-biting scenes. I was really rooting for Beckett and Eve and was thrilled at the conclusion to their story. 
 Although Beckett has changed somewhat in this book from Book #1, he is still the same loyal, tough, mean and sexy SOB as he was in Poughkeepsie. But it's his scenes with Eve that I loved most. 
 ""Eve was magnificent. Every damn time."" 
 Return to Poughkeepsie is a very substantial book, filled with sexy, funny, tender and dramatic moments. There are some heartbreaking story lines and some incredibly sexy and violent ones, too. I absolutely savored every single word of this story and was saddened to see it end. A fantastic sequel to one of my all-time favorite books.

 A beautiful, beautiful book about tragedy, life, love and forgiveness. Kacey has been through a terrible tragedy and flees with her little sister, Livie, to Miami to begin a new life. Kacey has sacrificed her own dreams of college to take care of her younger sister and put her through high school. They move into an apartment complex with a cast of characters including wonderful new friends and one gorgeous neighbor, Trent Emerson. 
 Kacey tries to numb her emotions and tries to push everyone away who cares about her. I absolutely loved how this story unfolded and I. found myself really rooting for Kacey to overcome her past tragedy and. let her emotions in! There is FANTASTIC chemistry between Kacey and Trent. I also loved the other characters, especially Kacey's little 
 sister Livie. A wonderfully written book that does not disappoint.

A moving story about second chances and the power of unconditional love. TSoT should be read by everyone. 
 True story: Several years ago I was planning my attendance at my very first book signing ever. A lovely reader from SLOVENIA (yes, you read that correctly) messaged me and asked if I could please try and get a copy of TSoT signed for her by Katja Millay. Of course, I said, I would certainly try. I thought to myself. wow, this book must really be something special! And so I bought the book and there it sat on my Kindle since 2013. Yes, I met the author, she was absolutely lovely but I did not fangirl over her because I had not yet read this treasure of a book!!! And now she seems to have disappeared!! GAAHHHHHH!! I need a do-0ver!! 
 If you are like me, you probably have tons of books sitting on your e-reader (and maybe even on your bookshelf) unread for whatever reason. I made a resolution that this year, I would slow down on taking ARC's and get through all of the wonderful books that I have been meaning to get to for years. Well, TSoT is now one of my all-time favorite books. I can't stop thinking about it. The author has a special gift with the written word and I just want to shout from the rooftops about this treasure! 
 ""My name is Nastya Kashnikov. I was a piano-playing prodigy who doesn't belong anywhere near an Intro to Music class. I was murdered two and a half years ago. Discuss."" 
 Nastya is starting high school at a new school, where she looks and feels and acts like the outsider that she is. She pushes everyone away with her special brand of toughness AND she also refuses to speak. At all. What happened to this girl that has made her so withdrawn from her family and everyone around her? 
 ""I live in a world without magic or miracles. A place where there are no clairvoyants or shapeshifters, no angels or superhuman boys to save you. A place where people die and music disintegrates and things suck."" 
 Besides getting the feel and all the angst of high school EXACTLY right, the author slowly reveals what has made Nastya into the girl she is today. But if Nastya thinks she has the self-pity market cornered, she's got nothing on Josh Bennett, another loner who has had the most terrible tragedies happen to him. Josh is also unapproachable but he becomes fascinated by this girl who wears all-black every single day and acts angry all the time. 
 ""She does look like a badass. I've seen her arms, and she's ripped, which is kind of weird and scary all at once because it just seems all wrong on her. She's really small and fragile-looking, and at the same time, it's like she's some exotic teenage mercenary, all rock solid, dressed in black, ready to take somebody down. None of it makes any sense. It's kind of disconcerting. She's like an optical illusion. You look at it from one angle and you see the picture and you think you've got a lock on it and then it shifts and the image changes to something entirely different and you can't even find the original picture anymore. It's a serious mindfuck."" 
 Nastya is an enigma. Her story gradually begins to unfold and it is extremely unsettling and almost unbearable. For all of her toughness, she is extremely fragile and vulnerable but eventually begins to let others in. Just a little. 
 ""I haven't said a word to another living person in 452 days. I write my three and a half pages, tuck away my composition book, and crawl into bed, knowing how close I came to not making it to 453."" 
 Let me just say two words about this book: Josh Bennett. He is sensitive, intelligent and loyal. He realizes how fragile Nastya is. I adore him! He doesn't know why she is so closed off to the world but he very carefully begins to crack her shell, little by little. 
 ""But the more she gives me, the more abstract she gets. It's like pieces to three different puzzles. You try to put them together but they never fit, and when you force them, the picture comes out all wrong. 
 Despite her resolution never to let someone love her, Nastya begins to get close to Josh and his very small circle of old friends. Their relationship unfolds very slowly but they just seem to understand each other. She still keeps secrets from him but she begins to trust him absolutely. 
 ""Josh Bennett laughs, and for one minute, everything is right in the world."" 
 Josh is Nastya's lifeline. As her carefully constructed world begins to fall apart, Josh is there for her. Until she pushes him away. I honestly did not know whether or not the author was going to give these two the happy ending they both so desperately deserved, but the ending was PERFECT. I almost stopped breathing during the last 15% of this book. Nastya is so pessimistic about her future that nothing about this book would have surprised me. 
 ""People like Josh Bennett and I don't get perfect. Most of the time, we don't even get remotely tolerable. And that's why it scares me. Because, even if there was such a thing to begin with, perfect never lasts."" 
 This book actually has some light moments and very funny scenes mixed in with all the angst. They were a welcome relief from the heaviness and were done just right. All of the supporting characters were absolutely perfect and I pray for another book soon from Katya Millay. If you haven't read this book yet, don't wait. It is truly a treasure.

 6 Stars. 10 Stars for the sex. 
 Here is the synopsis for Grounded, Book 3 in the Up In The Air Trilogy: 
 ""James and Bianca's story draws to a close in the conclusion to the Up 
 In The Air Trilogy. 
 After a short but burning hot courtship, Bianca can no longer deny her 
 feelings for James, and though she's tried her hardest, she can't help 
 but see that he cares deeply for her, as well. In an uncharacteristic 
 move, because of her abusive background, she has put aside her 
 misgivings and agrees to live with billionaire James. Is her leap of 
 faith the beginning of something wonderful, or is it too much, too 
 fast? 
 As James and Bianca feel a growing need for each other that neither 
 can deny, circumstances beyond their control intervene, trying to tear 
 them apart. Amidst the ever mounting threat of a monster who wants 
 Bianca dead, and the constant pitfalls of an indiscreet past that 
 James can't seem to escape, can these two passionate lovers manage to 
 find their happily ever after?"" 
 MR. CAVENDISH. YES, PLEASE. 
 Well, we had to think about this book for a few days before writing a 
 review. This is one of those rare books that we want to give 6 stars 
 to. The writing is so rich, so descriptive, that you will not want the 
 story of James and Bianca to end. The sex scenes are GRAPHIC, they 
 are HOT and they are FREQUENT! Our kind of book, for sure! 
 You will be excited, you will be crying (sobbing!), you will be angry 
 and you will be surprised by Grounded. And there are some fabulous 
 characters that look like they might be getting their own story? 
 Hello, Ms. Lilley? We are TOTALLY excited by that! 
 Loved the settings that switch between Las Vegas and New York City, 
 the flight attendant plot device totally works for us. 
 Some of our favorite quotes (and there were a LOT!): 
 ""'Turn around and look at me,' James said after a long moment, his 
 voice low and rough. It was insane, it was unreasonable, it was 
 self-destructive...and masochistic, but I grew wet at the sound of that 
 violent-roughened voice. I turned around."" - Bianca 
 ""Have I told you today how happy you make me? I can never go back from 
 this, Bianca. It would break me to let you go. You know that, right?"" 
 - James 
 Most of our favorite quotes give away the plot so we don't want to 
 spoil the book for those that have not yet read this gem. GO READ THIS

 I read this book a few months ago and have been thinking about it ever since. To me, that is the hallmark of an excellent book. Here is the synopsis of the story, in which a woman wakes to find a dangerous stranger in her bed: 
 ""Now your home has become your prison, and your body, a battlefield. How would you hold onto your sanity, your self-esteem, your very soul against someone determined to annihilate all three? 
 In the psychological thriller Break Her, one woman will find herself in this almost unthinkable situation, and one man will discover that he has finally come up against someone unlike any of those he has destroyed before. 
 On the surface, this intruder has all the advantages: strength, weapons, ruthlessness. The only way he can lose is if he finds himself responding to his victim on a human level. The only way she can win is if she rips away the protective lies she's told herself, the hard shell of indifference she's hidden in, and becomes again what she has not been since she lost everything that mattered to her, years ago. "" 
 Break Her is a very graphic story of the gripping psychological interplay between the woman and the rapist. (I refuse to call her simply ""Victim"" as some reviewers have done.) The rapist is very cunning and very strong. He is determined to destroy the woman not only physically, but emotionally as well. 
 ""He was decent looking. He probably had money. He could have sex any way he wanted any time he wanted. But he liked it this way."" 
 The story itself is set over a period of an excruciating day and a half, within the physical confines of a house. The characters are not named by the author. Through a series of flashbacks, however, the woman's past is explained in detail and other characters are introduced. I was hanging on every word, and reading furiously to reach the stunning conclusion of this book. 
 ""You think you'll wear me out,"" he hissed, not using a question. ""You think you'll eventually satisfy me, and reach the end of this. But everything you do makes me want you more, deeper, impossibly more. I think I'm reaching a point I've never hit before. Like perpetual motion. Or nirvana. I'll never stop."" 
 There are many questions raised by this story. What was the author trying to convey here? Well, first and foremost, I think it is a story of the woman's fierce strength and will to survive. The author has written this book under a pseudonym so that we do not know the writer's gender. Brilliant. 
 The author has ventured an opinion on the subject of rape in other forums that forgiveness allows rape victims to move on, and to separate themselves from what happened. The author has also questioned why rape is the only crime that seems to be an ""open wound"", which gives men a huge amount of power to know that by this one act, they can potentially destroy a woman. Certainly the woman in ""Break Her"" does not accept the definition of rape as an ""open wound"" and in that sense, this book is very empowering. 
 ""Break Her"" is an incredibly gripping and yes, emotionally exhausting, story. It is very thought-provoking and will make you question what values you believe in. I could not put this book down. I can only hope that the author chooses to continue the woman's story because I need more of this story.Break HerB.G.

 ***** 5 Killing Stars***** 
 Give me a second to fully digest everything I just read....umm... WOW ... there are no words to describe how this book made me feel. The tragic story of Roan ""Fox"" was simply the most heartbreaking thing ever. So when reading this book, make sure to prepare your hear, grab a box of tissues and be prepared to cry your eyes out. 
 ""The moment I set eyes on her, I tasted a delicious combination of fear and strength. Weakness and bravery, sadness and resignation. Instincts and needs that I'd buried and ignored volcanoes to the surface. I lost control. I broke every rule and I didn't give a fuck. She woke a part of me I didn't know existed, layered in ice and cold blooded disassociation."" 
 Roan ""Fox is a tortured soul who has lived a horrible life at the hands of the worse kind of people, who kidnapped and held him captive since he was six years old. He was beaten and tortured into conditioning to doing everything and anything they wanted including kill. 
 "" No one would look at me and think I was slave. But I had been. I still was. I probably would be forever."" 
 Once he finally escapes he begins to live as a zombie version of himself, unable to touch or be touch, unable to please or be pleased, simply miserable, living a life void of emotions and filled with fear. That is until he meets Hazel Hunter and his miserable life changes forever. 
 ""I'll give you two hundred thousand for one month of pure access. I want to buy your obedience, your body, your mind. But most of all I want to buy your secrets."" 
 "" Tonight, I did the one thing that made least sense of all. I bought a girl. And I would never let her go."" 
 ""Top rule. Unbreakable rule. Don't. Ever. Touch. Me."" 
 He begins to fight all his conditioning instincts to be a ""normal"" man for her. But as with everything in his life, nothing is ever that easy. The road to normalcy is not as easy as he thought it would be after only one look into Zel's eyes at his club. 
 "" You're Mine, and I refuse to live without you."" 
 The battle with his own personal demons wasn't so easily won. He has to challenge himself again and again with fear of losing the only people he loves. 
 ""Obey or I'll kill you."" 
 ""I'm here for you, for her. Forever if you'll have me. Just please-forgive me."" 
 Hazel ""Zel"" is a strong courageous woman, who fights with teeth and nail to save those she loves most. She instantly feels the connection between her and Fox and gives up herself in order to try to help him find his cure to his conditioning without losing her life along the way. But her secret can kill them both... 
 "" No, I'm not okay. Everything about you tells me to run, yet I ignore myself and end up getting hurt again. I find myself needing to help others-it's a compulsion driving me insane."" 
 "" You mistreat me, and I'll make you dickless for the rest of your life. Treat me with respect and desire and I'll stay. I accept your offer Obsidian Fox. Don't make me regret it."" 
 "" With fear and stupidity, I sold myself to him. Sold myself to a fighter who could sense my lies as easily as a fox senses a rabbit. 
 I regretted it. I reveled in it. It destroyed me."" 
 Meanwhile she is also trying to save the life of the one person she loves most and she is afraid that in the end she will end losing them both. The life of her daughter, the life of the one person who has the ability to change everything. 
 ""A child was my cure. The daughter of the woman I tried to kill. It was time to face my past full of darkness and say fuck you. It was time to start new memories."" 
 ""Her touch shattered me. Her touch awoke me. Her touch destroyed me."" 
 Their love is like no other, together they fight every instinct in their body, to run, to harm, to kill. He doesn't think he has what it takes to be a good man for her, and she can't give up on him, It's a love that fights all battles and has the ability to destroy them both. 
 "" You are worthy. Every day I spend with you, your improving."" 
 ""Only because I keep my distance and don't touch you. Believe me, if you knew my thoughts you would run."" 
 ""Do you want me to run?"" 
 ""You should."" 
 ""You own me, body and soul, Hazel Hunter. You're not just my lover but also my handler and I will walk over blades for you. I will kill for you. I will lay down my life for you."" 
 So, with nothing left to say other than YOU MUST READ this book!! You will Love Fox, you will also hate him but don't let that scare you in the end he makes it worth the wait but you need to read it to find out.

 There are no words to describe what I feel after reading this book! I am absolutely speechless... 
 I mean Seriously??? I don't normally drink but after all that I think I just may need one or 5! 
 There has to be another book! 
 Ok so I spent a big part of the book in a love, hate relationship with Twitch and Lexi. It's rare you read about a <""hero"" like Twitch, and that makes him all that more interesting. 
 ""There's something about Twitch. He's just raw."" 
 He is just all kinds of twisted, but at the same time he had his sweet, and happy moments with Lexi. These two together are just a complete loving mess. 
 ""Don't feel sorry for me. And don't assume you know me. You don't know shit about me."" 
 The story begins when we meet 6 year old Alexa, trying to take care of a beat up 8 year old Antonio. She feels sorry for him and tries to help him as best as she can. But what she doesn't realize is that little act of kindness, changed both of their lives forever. 
 ""You're hurt."" 
 ""No one else cares if I'm hurt."" 
 I whisper, ""I do."" 
 We stand there, staring at each other a long time. Finally, he comes closer to me and asks, ""What's your name?"" 
 ""Alexa. Alexa Ballentine."" He nods but says nothing. 
 Finally he comes closer to me and asks, ""What's your name?"" 
 ""Doesn't matter. You'll forget it once I'm gone."" 
 Stepping closer, I promise, "" No, I won't."" 
 Lifting his head, he runs a hand through his messy brown hair to keep it out of his face. He watches me a second more before he utters, ""Antonio Falco."" 
 As I read this book several parts of if made me contemplate putting it down and moving on to another book less... RAW... But that's just the thing though, the story of Twitch and Lexi was just so intense and captivating that I had to keep reading and had to know if they did get their HEA. 
 ""Monsters don't always lurk in the shadows. Sometimes they hide in plain sight."" 
 ""I don't want a knight in shining armor. 
 I don't want a knight in scuffed armor. 
 I want his helmet to have dents. I want my knight to be real, and dark and savage. I want my knight to be a survivor. Someone who's been tested and got through his trails. Not some pussy in gleaming metal."" 
 So yes listen to the author's note, This is not a love story. This is a story of love gone wrong. So if you can't handle reading a book that will strip you bare with every dark, twisted, compelling, heart wrenching page. 
 ""You'll be forever unsatisfied. No one will ever take care of you the way I can. The way I know you want it. I know what you need, Lexi, even if you don't know it yourself. But I'll teach you."" 
 I won't give much of the story away because reading it all for yourself is an experience you don't want to miss, so I don't want to ruin it for you. I'll just leave you with this... If you want a crazy complicated, heart stopping, soul wrenching story then you this is a MUST READ for you! 
 (view spoiler)["" She's in danger, though. And I need to keep her safe. Because I love her. I'd kill anyone who tried to hurt her. You said you'd never leave me. And I'm holding you to that. Because when you're safe again, I'm coming for you, Angel."" (hide spoiler)]

 Only for you 
 By: Genna Rulon 
 I will be honest and say that I expected the book to be much better. In the first few chapters the banter between Everleigh and Hunter had me laughing and picturing really good things for the rest of the book. But as the book progressed I feel like something was missing. There was that great connection in the beginning, Moments where I thought would be hilarious once discovered... 
 ""Sir, you are no gentleman."" 
 ""And you, Miss, are no lady."" 
 ""What man can quote a scene from the 1939 film classic? That does not happen in real life, hell, it doesn't even happen in books. I halted hastily in the middle of the parking lot. Of course--it was obvious as a hooker at a debutant ball--Hunter. Was. Gay. It explained his extraordinary looks, for no straight man looks that good--it's God's joke at women's expense. It explained his dislike of women, at least this woman. It explained his willingness to sit and listen to emotive music and contemplate the lyrical significance. Most importantly, it was the only plausible explanation for him quoting Rhett Butler, the dashing yet scandalous civil war hero from the gold standard of chick-flicks."" 
 and then nothing... 
 Don't get me wrong the author had a great story, the characters were lovable and fun but there was just something, some connection missing. 
 I must say I loved Ev though, she was simply one of a kind 
 ""Was he a cyborg created to epitomize masculine perfection, testing the restraint of earthly women?"" 
 ""But who will bring me coffee in the mornings and breakfast treats?"" 
 ""You're running a coffee shop. You have those items at your disposal,"" Hunter laughed. 
 ""That is true, but who will give me big bear hugs each day?"" 
 ""I'm sure you can persuade Sam to fill in for me when needed."" 
 ""She's physically incapable of giving me a bear hug--she can only provide tiny cub hugs."" 
 So... in the end of the day this book is still a must read because everyone NEEDS their Everleigh and Hunter Fix. 
 ""Do you remember my tattoo? I had it inked at the end of March. Do you remember what it means"" 
 -""Forever. You said it was the Japanese word for forever, eternal."" 
 -""Exactly. Forever."" He put his hand over his heart and repeated himself, separating the words, ""For--Ever."" ""I already knew, for me there is only you. No matter what happened between us in the future, it would only ever be you. I was made for you--only for you."" 
 Anything I can do to help you?"" ""Just be you, Everleigh. That's all I need.""

 One word... Cliffhanger!! Ugh, have I mentioned how much I hate cliffhanger? It's a bittersweet feeling because in a way it's good for the anticipation on what will happen next, but in this case NOT SO MUCH! Great read that may leave you blushing and wanting more... Now how can I explain my feelings about this book properly without giving too much away ??? 
 ""Cross was too hot for his own good. I couldn't let his Zeus like looks and charming mouth derail my plans."" 
 "" Of course I liked him! Even Mother Teresa would have liked him."" 
 ""I don't sleep around, Allie. I'm a one-girl kind of man."" 
 I think that pretty much covers it Right? Other than screaming HOT DAM!!!! 
 So to Sum up, Allie needs Tristan for her Revenge Tristan needs Allie for his Rescue, the lines get blurred and things get OH SO INTERESTING!! 
 "" Hit me."" I could have sworn I'd heard a slight growl in his voice. 
 ""What?"" 
 ""It's not a request. If you want me to consider you for the job you need to pin me to the floor."" 
 ""You just want me on top of you."" I crossed my arms at my front. 
 "" Actually I want you under me, and I wont have it any other way."" He grinned 
 I loved the story of Allie and Tristan, It was a mixture of the beginning of their love but also gave you an insight on one of the biggest worldwide issues we have today... SEX TRAFFICKING. Allie has to go under cover to get sold as a sex slave in order to try to save Tristan's ex from being sold. It was crazy to see the reality of sex trafficking. As much as I hated reading about what some of the women went through in the book, because I know it's a reality in our lives more than we'd like it to be, it was a good way of showing the readers what many women out there are going through. 
 ""If I had a choice I wouldn't hire you. I'd keep you far away from the scum we'll be dealing with. But you're too perfect for the job. You're beautiful, smart and strong."" 
 But on a lighter note... Allie and Tristan Cross were a great pair. They completed each other's every need with trust in each other from day one. The chemistry between these two simply left me fanning myself... 
 ""Cocky a bit? 
 "" I guess you'll have to wait and see. "" 
 ""You're unbelievable."" 
 "" I Know. And I'm glad you know it, too. "" 
 ""Have you always been a tease Allie? Or is it just for me? 
 ""What?"" 
 ""You say one thing but mean something else. I can see the way your body's reacting to me."" I mean come on... What can you really say to that? 
 "" You look beautiful when you blush."" 
 "" You should get off me."" I felt my muscles tense."" 
 ""I should, and I will, but know that I don't want to."" WOW!!! 
 "" You taste much better than I imagined."" 
 ""Imagined?"" 
 ""I wondered about your lips all night and couldn't sleep. Now I don't have to wonder anymore."" 
 ""I'm glad I satisfied your curiosity."" 
 But as much as Allie tried to keep their relationship strictly professional it only worked for about 2 seconds. It was great to see the sparks between these two. Because honestly with a guy like Cross I don't really blame her! 
 "" I'd tasted forbidden fruit I couldn't get enough of. And I wanted more, I needed more."" 
 "" Mr. Impossibly hot could not only make me swoon in bed, but also in his kitchen."" 
 "" You perv! We're supposed to be exercising."" 
 "" Believe me, my heart gets a better work out when I look at you."" 
 So, Like I said I hate Cliffhangers, therefore I need more of Tristan!! Like NOW !! So keep posted for the second installment ""Layers Peeled"". Can't WAIT!!

 Ok so under normal circumstances Nick would be all kinds of creepy for watching Daisy. But looking at it as a fictional perspective.... It's still odd but once you read on and get to know Nick you understand that in a way he doesn't know any better. 
 ""I was born a killer, my teeth bared, and I claimed my first victim almost before I had taken my first breath. But that is Ukraine. A boy on the streets without a gun is prey. I have never been prey. Always the hunter."" 
 ""It takes many muscles to smile, more to frown, but only few to pull the trigger."" 
 Of course being the main characters and all you can't help but fall in love with Nick and Daisy. To watch both of them get over their fears and discover life together. 
 ""There is something so vibrant, so aware, so alive about him that it sings to me. I am drawn to him like a moth to a flame."" 
 "" I will kiss you Daisy. I will kiss you all night. I will do more than kiss you if you wish."" 
 Daisy has just escaped her father's prison and Nikolai is attempting to free himself from the only life he knows, at the same time they are trying to build their first relationship. 
 Neither one of them knows what to do, what's right and wrong in a relationship. But together they work on building their trust and love for one another even through the obstacles their old insecurities and fears throw their way. 
 "" I knew I could not keep you,"" he says. His voice is hoarse with emotion. ""Such a beautiful, innocent soul. I just wanted you for as long as I could have you. I knew it was wrong, and I did not care. Someday I hope you forgive me."" 
 There were times I just wanted to shake some sense into Daisy, and there were times that I also wanted to tell Nikolai to Man up but I did enjoy learning about them. 
 "" The villains had a hard life. They did not know any other way forward."" 
 "" I can't hate Nick. I'm still hopelessly in love with him. 
 With the bad guy. 
 I wonder what this makes me."" 
 I am not going to lie, it's an interesting read, it's not usually my favorite kind but I thoroughly did enjoy reading it. Would I recommend it? Yes, I definitely would. 
 "" I love Nick for who he is, Not what he is."" 
 ""See the truth in my eyes and know I do this for you."" But whatever you decide, Kitten, I will support you."" 
 Their love for one another despite all their struggles is so captivating, that it makes it hard to explain.. So I'll just let their own words do the explaining... 
 ""Spasiba."" 
 ""Why do you thank me?"" 
 ""For caring enough to care about how I feel."" 
 ""I do not think you realize, Daisy. You are everything to me."" 
 "" Every day that passes, I love Nick more and more. I don't care about his past. We will build our own future, together."" 
 "" We're both patient people, Nick and I. We know how to wait, there's pleasure in the waiting."" 
 So Read it, Trust Me you will enjoy it!!

 Ruin 
 By: Rachel Van Dyken 
 I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I laughed out loud, Smiled myself silly, and Cried my eyes out, but LOVED every single minute of it!!! 
 I can't stress this enough but I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the story of Wes and Kiersten. 
 It's an Amazing MUST READ! 
 It will leave you so caught up in emotions that you will be speechless and thinking about this book for weeks.... Trust me!! 
 ""I turned around... and ran smack dab into a tree. 
 Or at least it felt like a tree. 
 But trees weren't warm. 
 And they didn't have one, two, three, four, six, Good Lord, eight? Eight packs? Furthermore, had I actually been feeling said person's eight pack? And, dear God, I was counting. I had touched each muscle. And great, my hand was still firmly placed against the guy's stomach. 
 I jerked my hand back and closed my eyes. 
 ""Were you just counting my abs?"" 
 I think that in itself is enough said about Wes don't you think? How can you not fall in love with him? 
 His eyes held my ruin. 
 ""Weston."" He held his hand . ""And you are?"" 
 Screwed Kiersten."" 
 "" I seriously couldn't stare at him in the face; that was how gorgeous he was. I'd never seen such a good looking guy in real life before. Sure, I'd seen them on magazines and movies, but this guy... He was living breathing, walking sex. And considering I had no experience in that department, I was putting up every wall I could think of in order to remember to breathe."" 
 I loved their instant connection and hilarious, heartwarming banter. I couldn't help but smile almost the entire time. 
 ""I don't get it. I could have sworn the freshman RA was a female."" 
 ""Sex change"" Weston said with a straight face. "" I was a confused child."" 
 "" Funny."" I rolled my eyes. ""Seriously? I requested an all girls dorm and got put in a co-ed building, and then my RA is a --"" I was going to say hot guy by refrained from embarrassing myself. 
 ""Sex god."" He said it for me. "" I know, some people have all the luck."" 
 I am struggling to write a review for this without giving too much away and ruining the suspense for you so I think it's easier to let the characters speak for themselves... 
 Lisa and Gabe were simply HILARIOUS!! I think everyone needs a roommate and friends like Lisa and Gabe. 
 My screaming broke a lamp?"" 
 ""No."" She shook her head. "" My fall broke the lamp. Seems jumping out of your bunk bed at one in the morning's a contact sport. My lamp being the main target. No worries. She sighed. "" It didn't suffer. It shattered on contact with the floor. And then again after I slipped on the teddy bear that also fell. And that's great since it broke my fall onto the floor, making it so I escape with two faint bruises. "" 
 ""Holy crap! I'm so sorry!' 
 ""Nah, it's fine. I'm a walking accident."" She laughed. "" But if you plan on screaming all night, I'm taking the floor. My lamp killing days are behind me."" "" Oh and I sleepwalk so if you wake up to me standing over you, try not to punch me in the face. "" 
 ""Wow, we're sure the fun pair."" 
 And then there is the fact that Wes is keeping a major bomb from Kiersten (spoilers) 
 ""I was keeping something epic from her, which sort of made me the villain in this tale. But damn, I wanted to be the hero."" 
 ""For the first time in a year, I wanted to live -- because I wanted to spend every freaking day watching her open her eyes to the world. Hell, I wanted to be the first thing she saw. Sometimes, reality's a bitch."" Enough said... 
 So yes Read this book, Love it, Devour it!! 
 It's just that good!! 
 But before you do be sure to get comfortable, make sure you are alone , be prepared to not sleep and definitely have the tissues ready!! 
 ""I can tell you have a good heart... because the minute I met you, I wanted to fight for it."" 
 She was silent. 
 ""That's how you can tell when someone has a good heart... when you want to be the one to make it beat."" 
 ""I want all of your heart, even the broken pieces, the shredded ones that no longer fit. I want all of them - all of you. I need it all."" SWOOOON

 Maybe Someday 
 By: Colleen Hoover 
 I can honestly say that I am a HUGE Colleen Hoover book fan! I have read both series she has written so far and LOVED everyone of them. She has a way with words that I can honestly say I have cried my eyes out in each one of her books. So with that in mind I have to say this book was a little different for me. It's a really good book, very well written and all I just didn't feel all of the emotions I am used to feeling when reading a Colleen Hoover book. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed reading the story of Ridge and Sydney. The distinct and emotional way their love for music despite all obstacles pushed them together was amazing. There is no way to write a full review without giving too much away so I'll try my best to let the character's words speak for themselves. 
 ""We try so hard to hide everything we're really feeling from those who probably need to know our true feelings the most."" 
 ""Sometimes in life, we need a few bad days in order to keep the good ones in perspective."" 
 It was beautiful to watch the two of them grow together, not only through their struggles but also through the obstacles life has thrown at them. To see them realize there is more to life then the issues they face. 
 ""A life of mediocrity is a waste of a life."" 
 ""Words can sometimes have a far greater effect on a heart than a kiss."" 
 Music is what brings them together; it's what brings light to the great connection they share. Writing music together connects the two of them in a way they never thought possible to have with another. 
 ""However, I've learned that the heart can't be told when and who and how it should love. The heart does whatever the hell it wants to do. The only thing we can control is whether we give our lives and our minds the chance to catch up to our hearts."" 
 These challenges and the enormity of the connection they share lead them to doing things they never thought they would be capable of. 
 ""I kiss her every way I can possibly kiss her, because I plan on loving her every way I can possibly love her. Every single time we refused to cave in to our feelings in the past makes this kiss completely worth the sacrifices."" 
 ""The more I open up to him, the more I need him. The more I admit to myself that I need him, the most it hurts to know that I still don't exactly have him."" 
 I am not going to lie, There were several times that I just wanted to shake Sydney and Ridge and tell them to just make up their mind already but then there was the soft side of me that can understand their struggle. 
 ""There's no other way to describe how I feel. I know that the way I think about her and feel about her is wrong, but I struggle so much with how right it feels when I'm with her."" See what I Mean??? 
 ""Never in all my life and in all my years of living in a world of silence have I wanted to hear something as much as I want to hear her sing right now. I want to hear her so bad it physically hurts."" 
 I mean seriously??? How can your heart not hurt for these two after Ridge saying something like that? Getting to know Ridge and the difficulties he has gone through opened my eyes to what it would be like to go through the same things. It's crazy to see that it is a reality and what sometimes can tare someone apart can also bring others together. 
 ""God, if just holding hands with him feels this intense, I can't imagine what everything else with him would feel like."" 
 ""I don't know when you'll be ready for me. It might be next month or next year. Whenever it is, just know that I have absolutely no doubt that we can make this work. I know we can. If there are two people in this world capable of finding a way to love each other, it's us."" So pretty much READ this book, like right now! You will LOVE it trust me!!

 Seriously, between being HOT, FUNNY and OH SO VERY ADORABLE, Cam was the perfect catch!! 
 "" I'm not going out with you Cam.""

It is central to this coming-of-age story and adroitly handled. Accompanying this central issue are the expected themes: sexual awakening, conflicts with parents, identity issues, choices to be made. 
 Early in the book we see Donna, the narrator whose father has recently died, deciding to become a mortician. We follow her thinking on this as she navigates the world of senior year at high school. 
 The ending, though predictable to adults, may not be predictable to the intended audience. And although I expected the resolutions, my interest was held to see how they would be effected.

There was not much to locate it in time. I haven't decided if that is good--ie, makes it universal, or bad--missing its grounding in history. 
 It was an intense study of the self-hatred promoted by the homophobia of the times and its disastrous effects of partners, both male and female. There were stereotypical characters, but the two main ones were well developed. 
 It was a page turner, starting with something like this: tonight is the last night before the worst morning in my life. I liked the use of flashback to tell the story ( I seem to say that a lot.)

One is the narrator, looking back at her life in the school from a more informed perspective. There is just enough of the mature commentary to remind us of the incomplete version of the younger girl. 
 The first section describes Tambu's life on the family farm while her brother goes to school and her attempt to grow enough corn and sell it to get her own school fees. The next section shows her in the mission school living with her uncle, the headmaster, rooming with her cousin, Nyasha. The third section I will leave unidentified, for it would be a giveaway. 
 In the second section as Tambu waits for her aunt, the description of the uncle's house conveys the difference between the conditions of the native population and the privileged black population. Only very indirectly do we get indications of the white population. The events that follow reveal the identity issues the two girls face.

 I enjoyed this third book almost as much as the first two. The plot had as many twists and turns and dangers, mostly overcome. I was not too surprised that Coin turned out to be a power grabber, and liked the way she was dispatched with. 
 I liked the way the author avoided killing off either Gale or Peeta; however, I felt the way she dispensed with Gale was lame. First his observation that Katniss only loved him when he was injured or needy and second his observation that the only thing he had had going was protecting her family. These did not ring true. And to blame him for Prim's death because it may have been a weapon that he created also seemed a stretch. Their hunting times had given them a much deeper bond than that. 
 Having the media people around almost all the time intensified the commentary on reality TV, and having the two versions of news underlined the importance of knowledge in making decisions and of the press. The three books together seem an indirect commentary on war video games that prepare for real war and the victors recognized the Hunger Games in the way the Capitol was booby trapped and even named the revolution Hunger Games 76. 
 I was surprised at Katniss voting for Hunger Games with the children of the decision makers of the Capitol. I could see the revenge aspect. I could see avoiding total depletion of population. But it didn't seem in character for how much she had hated the games or for her moments of realizing that people in the capitol were people too. So I am on the fence on that issue. 
 11/30/15 On rereading after the movie. I see Katniss's vote as strategy toward her new goal of killing President Coin rather than as a character inconsistency. I see an intensification of the critique of the gamelike quality of the war in looking at contemporary drone warfare. 
 Perhaps Katniss's thought, expressed only once, makes enough sense to justify her shift from Gale to Peeta: She didn't need Gale's anger; she had enough of her own. She needed Peeta's attitude for balance. She probably could have ended up happy with either. Whenever objecting to Gale's attitudes and strategies, she balanced it with thoughts of her own actions that caused deaths of others, thoughts made all the more important in these days of drone strikes and ""collateral damage."" Not enough that Prim is killed trying to attend the wounded, there is also the tragic irony that Katniss became a tribute in order to save her in the beginning, and the book ends with her death. 
 I see WWII connections I had missed in the last parachute attack being unnecessary because Snow was ready to surrender. [I'd not believed him on the first read, but came closer to believing him on the second, though the ambiguity is pretty strong.] Also the double attack after medical aid has come in parallels Nagasaki after Hiroshima. And the ""war to end all wars"" comments.",Mon Jun 25 23:24:30 -0700 2012,Tue Dec 01 08:33:35 -0800 2015,Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 -0700 2012,Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 -0700 2012,0,0

The plot and characters seemed to exist only to illustrate an aspect of Chinese history or factory conditions or options in 1920-30s China for women. 
 I am intrigued by the hair dressing ceremony wherein women could choose to become a member of the sisterhood of silk workers, an alternative to arranged marriages. A parallel ceremony to marriage; the choice as permanent. Like secular nuns. 
 Even if the factories allowed women to escape family and marriage, even if it allowed them to send some support home, it is not a good excuse for running a sweatshop, and this factory did become/was always that--hence the strike. However, the strike was unconvincing; the results too easy. I have read about the labor movement's beginning in the US of A, and I must confess that I am now interested to learn to what extent there was a parallel movement in China, and if indeed it was that much easier than in the US. 
 There seemed an abrupt shift from isolated rural to involvement with the Japanese invasion. While it was abrupt, it may have reflected the awareness of the rural people as the fighting moved closer to them. So I have mixed feelings about the ending. There were slight hints earlier of trouble up north. The entrance of difficulties still felt sudden and intrusive.

 On the first reading I was just confused. On the second I kept better track of the characters because I remembered most of the names that reappeared. I was also better able to keep track of India/Pakastan history and politics the second time through. 
 I laughed frequently, but most heartily at the chapter ""Hit the Spittoon"" and at the courtship in fragments with the sheet with the hole. Fragmentation imagery abounds in the story and in the related history. 
 Rushdie presents an interesting study of relativity. One memorable mention was this: India is a land of alternative realities and Pakastan a land of infinite falsehoods. (Not quite quoted exactly) Another is the section about the India/Pakastan war that juxtaposes the headlines from newspapers from each country.

 Also amusing. Here in the first one, cell phones worked in Three pines. In the later ones they don't. 
 And as far as I can tell, an inconsistency within this first one: an early scene takes place in the bistro and it is about a delay; later when that delay is explained, it also happened at the bistro, so would have been impossible for the waiting person to have missed it. Small detail.

 One thing I have liked about the two I have read was that character development is as important as solving the mystery.

So I learned the carnival meaning. Luckily the really gross and bloody part occurred only briefly at the beginning. The next oddity was the father deciding to produce his own freak show for the carnival (based on his seeing horticultural variety at the International Test Rose Garden). The mother dutifully took drugs to alter her offspring. Their living children were four: Arty with fins for arms and legs; Elly and Iphy, the Siamese twins; Oly, the hunchbacked, dwarf narrator; and Chick the youngest, with his special powers. 
 Had it not been a group read, I might have stopped there. However, I remembered a comment of a professor about other novels with ""grotesques"": What could the author say through them that couldn't be said through more average characters? I decided to read a bit more through that frame. Then the next chapter captured my attention with its narrative strategy of jumping into the future with Oly and her daughter Miranda. Several events are revealed that make a reader wonder how they happened. That same strategy is used a few more times, like a carrot to keep one reading. For the first two thirds of the book, the pacing was very effective. Then the notes of a reporter/participant were introduced, and while they provided important information that Oly, the narrator, couldn't have known, they dragged the pace considerably. Also the very ending of the book, while motivated, seemed to take too long. It also left me wondering to what extent it was a change in her character instead of an extension. 
 I have not yet answered the What could be said question. First hypothesis, something about disability issues. Did not hold up. Second hypothesis, something about minorities. The carnival provided a sort of ghetto where deformities were normal; however, the carnival was dependent on the money of the norms buying tickets. Oly didn't feel odd till she no longer lived in the carnival setting. 
 One group member read an interview with the author and learned she is an environmentalist and is anti-war. Perhaps the father's manipulation is an extreme of the various pollutants in our atmosphere, food, and water. And there was one paragraph in the reporter's notes where Arty ponders how people could criticize his followers who are maimed by choice and not criticize war with the injuries it produces. Maybe. And is it really choice when there is cult-like power in the leader and manipulation?

 The first three or four chapters introduce readers to various interrelated groups of people; other characters are introduced along the way. At one point I counted 8 subplots going. More were added. 
 As you might imagine, that made for a lot of cliff hangers--but they weren't really intense till the last 150 pages. There were a few times I wanted to say, Just get on with it. But generally the pacing was effective. Time was not linear. Some background was withheld till the last 300 or so pages. There were two major sections that provided back story. There were some sections set in the future. 
 Most background bits and character sketches were relevant and interesting. More for understanding character than furthering plot, though some did move the plot along. It was fun to see a scene reappear from someone else's perspective or as background to something else going on. I am sure it happened more than I recognized. 
 Interludes likewise provided insight into characters and added to plot: a letter from father, never sent, two communications from a son/grandson. There was an article written by one of the journalist characters split into two--it provided characterization and background, and the second part moved plot. However, readers got to see characters reading it and reacting before we got to read that portion of the article. There was a fanzine published by one of the characters. Some of it was important to the plot, some was extraneous. 
 It is a book for enjoying the journey more than finding out who dunnit. 
 Most of the plots were tied up. Some resolutions I'd anticipated, some were very surprising. A good mix. I have noticed a tendency in current fiction to explain how things turn out years beyond the ending; I prefer the older suggestion/hints approach to the future.. This novel projected for a couple of characters, but it was not excessive. 
 Characters were well drawn. I can think of only one that was totally unlikable. Most were sympathetically presented, even some I'd not have liked if meeting them in real life.

Actually I think the main link to history is the naming of characters. (I googled names of those on the expedition and yes they were on the original, but not necessarily similar. For example Clark is a female ranger, though she led the book's expedition; York is her half brother, though it is indicated he is dark.) I saw two parallels: Lewis kept a journal and the two got separated for a piece. Maybe someone who knows more about the historical trek would see more subtle parallels. 
 The pacing was intense. There were always several subplots going, and moving back and forth was pretty well signaled--only occasionally confusing. The shifts created many cliff hangers. It was very hard to put down at bedtime. (And you can see I didn't put it down many times.) There were enough twists and turns, but not too many. 
 The main characters were fairly rounded and developed. Some of the minor ones less so, having no dimension beyond their evilness. The setting was vividly described: hot, cold, mutations, past history; the ongoing fires in oil fields were quite convincing.

She fills her time and pays her bills making copies of paintings for a reproduction service --not a crime when sold as reproductions. And she is a Degas specialist. The story is fiction, but is based on the fact of a still unsolved theft from the Gardener Museum. Painting and painter detail is important to the plot and interesting as well. 
 The plot moves between the painter's present copying of a Degas for a gallery dealer, as part of a bargain to get her own show, to a past painting for a friend. Gradually we learn about her first bad decision. Interspersed are 19th century letters of the Gardener behind the museum to her niece; a note at the end tells what is history and what is fiction--the letters are fiction. 
 As Claire, the artist, researches technique she begins to question the authenticity of the piece she is copying. She falls in love with the gallery dealer. And as they say, the plot thickens.

Luckily there are a few places where all seems resolved and one can put it down to do something else. It took only a few pages to realize ""water war"" was not a metaphor. Sometimes it seemed there was more gory detail than necessary to make that point. The subplots merge in believable ways. The medical detail is not always so believable even with the future orientation.

The second amazing thing is that it explained rowing to someone who had no clue (me) and little interest in sports in such a way that it was clear but not too much. 
 The story of the road to the Olympics is told mostly from the perspective of Joe Rantz;however, as he requested, it is told in the context of ""the boat""--more than the shell that they propelled with oars, ""the boat"" is the spirit of the team working together in perfect harmony. The physical boat too is a character, and Pocock, its maker, stands out as one filled with wisdom about people as well as rowing and boat building.

Martha ends up with a circle of ranches at which she breaks horses, so the novel is about the people at the various ranches. Reading that the novel had seeds in Marie's story in Cowgirls: Women of the American West made me want to read that oral history too. 
 I was delighted to read a book with the main character a woman doing ""man's"" work as an equal. (view spoiler)[ I would have preferred less of the romance. At first it seemed that the competent Woodruff sisters, who owned one ranch on her circuit, would remain her role model. I would have liked to see her strong and independent character remain.

 The characters are mostly well rounded, the positive ones more than the negative. The latter seem all bad throughout.

He is more interested in premises than the logic built from them.He eschews closed systems that have lost touch with lived reality. He wants practice to account for the black swan events (the unpredictable, rare event --positive or negative--with great impact). Current economic models do not. He is skeptical about what can be known or predicted, about models. He speaks of false confirmation (every white swan seems to confirm that swans are white; however, one black swan disproves it). He speaks of other thought processes that misguide. He occasionally speaks to how to live with uncertainty--ignore what has low impact, avoid the negative with high impact, or at least bolster yourself against the possibility, and seek to be open the the positive possibility. 
 Where he does touch on practical measures (other than recommending we withhold judgment on important issues or bolster against loss) I find our ways diverging. He briefly touched on climate change. Though he agrees it is a problem, he is skeptical of the modeling there too. And though he thinks the misleading of financial models is a problem, he blames regulation for creating the need for predicting. 
 The book vacillated between interesting and tedious. Although Taleb nodded to art, literature, and medicine, most of his arguments and examples came from the world of finance, an unfamiliar (and minimally interesting) world to me. He appears to be trying to introduce paradigm shift into financial/risk management thinking, and as such has to give more arguments and evidence than I as a lay person needed.",Thu Jun 11 09:06:51 -0700 2015,Mon Aug 03 09:25:07 -0700 2015,Sun Aug 02 00:00:00 -0700 2015,Wed Jul 22 00:00:00 -0700 2015,1,0

From the review I learned that the novel included two related narratives; half of the editions started with the one narrated by the 15th Century painter, the other half by the daughter of a woman who had loved a painting by that artist. I don't think there is any way to tell which edition you are getting other than the illustration just before ""Chapter 1"" The girl's has the security camera, the artist's has eyes. I got the girl first, and I am glad. 
 Both narratives are stream of consciousness with fluctuations from past to present. The girl's moves from life before her mother died to her present. The artists moves from his life and times to the girl's present as he follows her after she looks at one of his paintings. The links were harder to follow in the artist's section, and had I started reading there, I'd have been quite disoriented much of the time. However, reading it second, I could use cues from the girl's earlier narrative. Of course I'll never know what it would have been like to start with the artist. 
 Both stories were intriguing and held my attention. And as the review stated, juxtaposing them creates a third narrative. I have a lot of thinking to do on that third one. The characters seemed real and likable. 
 There were so many ""boths"" to ponder being. Occasionally the author was a little heavy handed in reminding us to think about such distinctions, but that was rare and also forgivable. Some that I pondered were both living and dead, both old and new, both viewer and viewed, I'm sure there are more. It is a book worth rereading.",Sat Jun 06 15:45:03 -0700 2015,Wed Jul 01 21:07:16 -0700 2015,Mon Jun 22 00:00:00 -0700 2015,Thu Jun 18 00:00:00 -0700 2015,0,0

 Presented as a spy novel, it is, but it isn't the thriller one might expect. It is more an exploration of character, of times, and of the interaction. It has philosophical moments that are entirely in character and not intrusive, thoughts on being of two minds, on representation, and on ""nothing."" The latter was interesting, but I am not sure how seriously to take it. The former makes me think that if I were still teaching, I might join this book with How to Be Both in a unit. 
 For me the theme of Who-Gets-to-Represent-Us? enters with the chapters about a movie script and its shooting. However, that was a ways into the novel, so I might reread to see if I missed its actual beginning. When the movie chapters appeared, they seemed an interruption, but gradually they were woven into the whole. 
 The plot was slow, as character explorations tend to be, slow in a good sense. There were moments where action was faster paced and it was a page turner. There was a nice rhythm between the two. We are told early on that the narration is really a ""confession"" to a ""commandant,"" so we keep wondering what the narrator did to get him into that position. We also expect, and get, some torture scenes. They feel really long while reading them, but don't take a large percentage of pages. 
 Some of the characters have names. Some don't, but rather are identified by position and sometimes affect: ""the crapulent major,"" the congressman,"" the ""affectless lieutenant."" It would be worth a second read to look for a pattern of who gets named and who doesn't. It isn't wholly major/minor characters. It doesn't create stock characters. It may relate to the degree in intimacy with the narrator, but I'm not ready to commit to that. 
 It is a novel worth reading once to see how it ends; it is worth rereading to ferret out deeper meaning. 
 Second Reading 
 I marveled more at the skill of the stream-of-consciousness; the shifts were managed such that I almost always knew where I was in the larger narrative. And I marveled at turns of phrase and metaphors more than I noticed on the first reading. And, as usual on a second reading, I was more alert to how all the small parts fit together into the larger structure. 
 I did list the characters named and unnamed; there seem to be an almost equal number of each. I still don't see a pattern, but will keep looking. 
 The 'representation' theme (view spoiler)[ morphed into an identity theme and the narrator shifted from ""I"" to ""we"" when speaking of himself. It seemed a culmination of his mother's saying he was not half but all of each nationality, a culmination of his finding his place in his two spy roles. (hide spoiler)] 
 The ending and the play on ""nothing"" remain fascinating. (view spoiler)[ ""nothing"" becoming a positive and transforming the meaning of ""Nothing is more important than freedom and independence."" Man, the blood brother and the commissar in charge of re-education, leads the narrator to see that what starts as revolution ends as a power grab, hence as 'nothing.' And yet hope does not die. 
 Reading the torture aka re-education scenes I wondered if that was intended to judge the communist side that the narrator had been working for as a double agent, the ending being a point of emphasis. And yet it was the CIA manual that they used to orchestrate the torture. So it was not a single, national judgment. (hide spoiler)] 
 The narrative style changes abruptly at the end. The slow-paced narration of a life becomes a mix of first and third person reporting and told contemporaneously with events rather than as memory. It also becomes more philosophical, though still not intrusive.",Tue Apr 21 08:07:58 -0700 2015,Wed Sep 20 10:29:50 -0700 2017,Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 -0700 2017,Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 -0700 2017,0,0

 Gawande also opens up new ways to think about dealing with debilitating changes forced by disease or age. He offers a critique of traditional nursing homes, of what ""assisted living"" has become, and of medical practice based more on procedures than persons. His illustrations with case studies--some showing failure, others showing success--take the book beyond theory to readable. 
 Gawande challenges the narrow focus on safety and extending life and replaces it with concern for quality of life. He notes that people making quality-of-life decisions for patients often think in terms of what they, themselves, want, not what the patient would want. He questions the Maslow hierarchy's application to all ages and stages. ""Freedom to be the author of our lives"" within whatever circumstances we are dealt becomes primary.

 The start was very slow and gimmicky. I might not have finished had it not been a group read. However, about 1/3 into it, the pace and interest picked up. The twists and turns and clues and red herrings were interesting to follow as the book forged on to solve the whodunnit. 
 Usually I like a novel with several stories that end up merging. These were somehow annoying. They merged from the beginning and the shifts were annoying and confusing. I resented having to look back at chapter headings to see what was simultaneous and what past.

 It is filled with Irish story telling and Native American story telling as father and grandfather record stories for grandson, Daniel. Grandfather (called by two names: Worried Man and Billy) pursues a quest. Readers are drawn into the town and the lives of the characters slowly; narratives shift among the characters as well to enrich our understanding of the town's people. 
 The style is both beautiful and annoying. Overall the description is part of the pleasure of reading, however, occasionally the cataloguing gets to be tedious. Usually, however, it is enriching and beautiful. One device I particularly enjoyed was the cataloguing based on one image.

 The book totally held my attention, and it avoided overly romanticized developments and endings. Most of the characters were likable, some took a while and a revelation or two to achieve that status. Only one, Patrick, never became likable to me. 
 Whose story was it, Lou's or Will's? I think Lou's. And that is one reason it had to end as it did. She could not have gone on considering herself the reason Will stayed alive. Just think of the reaction when she moved in with Patrick. The mother's reaction colored future decisions of Lou and how she could present herself. Her life would have been totally stifled, thinking what effect any decision she made would have on Will. It would have become a prison. 
 And I think it good that there was no love-solves-all ending. 
 The book did a good job of exposing peoples' reactions to people with visible disabilities, the lack of adequate modifications to ease their independence, the difficulty of negotiating details. And it alerts to some possibilities that exist 
 But where were the adaptive equipment and counseling. Why hadn't some counselor gotten Will the computer equipment long before Lou introduces it; why hadn't he been introduced to the online quad support group. Why didn't he get to the group instead of Lou. There were sports he could do, and nothing was wrong with his mind. He could have continued at his job. 
 Even though it was a good read, I was put off by stereotypes. It was written from an able-bodied bias that life without an able body is not worth living. (I do realize there would be no plot if that were taken away.) I remember a discussion once on differences between stereotype and experience: the able bodied says a person is ""confined to a wheel chair""; the person in the chair sees it as a mobility device, as freeing them to be able to get around, not confined.",Sun Nov 24 20:53:37 -0800 2013,Mon Jan 13 02:02:07 -0800 2014,Sun Jan 12 00:00:00 -0800 2014,Sat Jan 11 00:00:00 -0800 2014,1,0

 The novel is about a woman who experiences trauma induced amnesia; it starts with her becoming aware of being in the water up to her knees, not knowing what she had gone searching for. The chapters alternate with hers, her fiance's and an aunt's, gradually filling readers in on needed background. The struggle, in addition to regaining memories, involves re-establishing a relationship--or not.

Time is marked by the birthdays of the narrator who was seven at the beginning of the novel; otherwise day runs into day to the reader, as it probably would to those experiencing the relocation and forced labor and hunger. At least twice the dark irony of ""improvements"" upon the ways of the peasant rice farmers appears, ""improvements"" that ignore accumulated wisdom and inevitably fail. 
 Sometimes that wisdom is told as overheard conversations. Occasionally the child narrator's observations and questions are convincingly childlike; however, overall, the depth of thought and beauty of description is more adult. And yet even though it was difficult to remember the age of the narrator, I am not sure I would have wanted to give up the language with which the tale was told. Perhaps an omniscient narrator would have worked better. Still, no narrator choice is without loss as well as gain. 
 There is a point where the mother decodes a note; I wondered both, Why so late? and Would she have been able to use the information if she had understood it earlier? Also I wondered at the two dimensional nature of the child military, the Khmer Rouge. Perhaps that is all a seven to ten year old child could see, but rarely is someone pure evil.

 I am hooked on the series, The Cemetery of Forgotten Books. This second book had more violence than I remember in the first one, but the plot wasn't limited to escapes and failures at escaping. There is character development, mystery, and philosophizing too. And as in the first book, in this one there are cross overs between a novel the narrator is reading and the narrator's experiences. 
 Description keeps the other worldly atmosphere vivid, at times almost Poe-like. Although at times I wanted the author to ""get on with the story,"" I usually appreciated the scene and mood setting.

We learned many ways to be Nigerian and American through the characters, but none of them existed only to be illustrations. 
 I enjoyed all 580+ pages, and was in suspense till the very end as to the conclusion. And I would have found it a satisfying read if it had ended in two of the three ways I'd anticipated, tolerable for the third. And every page was necessary to get to that conclusion. 
 The narrative movement was not chronological, though there was a clear timeline to the present section. The back story appeared more thematically as it related to the present story. The bulk of the novel was back story. 
 The social commentary was well handled, never controlling the narrative, appearing often through Ifemelu's blog--first through subject lines, then through actual entries. Other appearances through conversations of Ifemelu and her friends. Always natural and appropriate to the context. 
 The style is worth remarking. Vivid descriptions help evoke an unfamiliar world. Images, such as ""yet there was cement in her soul"" (7) and ""the air wrinkling between them""(338) evoke the interior of the characters and conversations.

 A group I am in has chosen it for this month, so I am rereading it (March 2016) 
 Sometimes plot structure is more clear on a second reading--who is speaking? who is who? what happened before? I am sure I made connections on this reading that I missed on the first. 
 The boy, Daniel, is taken by his father to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books to select one to remember and take care of. He chooses The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Corax, and he begins a search for information about the author. Thus a past story and a present story emerge, stories with many parallels, but not totally parallel--nothing that predictable. One has to read attentively to track which story's background fits the current chapter. 
 The narrator for most is Daniel, but there is a surprise section narrated by another with occasional details that seem impossible (or maybe I missed a cue somewhere). However, the lapse, if it is a lapse is minor.

Now quite a few of the characters were identified as retirement age. However, in only one segment was age a factor in the novel. Behaviors could have been most any age. 
 Two things were especially interesting: The narration shifted perspectives, often with a moment linking up two tellings of a similar moment. In spite of all that shifting, the perpetrator was not obvious. 
 And secondly, there was a lot more plot going on than mere ""whodunnit."" 
 One weakness: the theme/message/moral was hammered too heavily. 
 It is number 7 in a sequence of ""Chief Inspector Gamache"" mysteries. It stood alone. There may have been references to prior novels that would be fun for those who knew them, but I never felt left out. There was enough detail. I would read another in this series. 
 October 2016: And now I am reading the series from start to finish and have arrived at #7. I am rereading it to see the references to prior books as well as to refresh my memory. While it read okay alone (3 stars that reading), it is much richer after having read 1-6. Not only do I know the characters better from the previous books, but I also see some foreshadowing of events to come. I don't remember so much of the foreshadowing in #1-6. Is it a new thing, or have I just become aware? The foreshadowings are not the cliff hangers of soap operas, just loose ends.

 One of the pleasures of a second reading is that no longer needing to find out ""what happens next?"" frees one to enjoy other features. And to revise previous opinions. Or to see that the wrong questions were asked. I started reading with a focus on Ruth, as planned. The more I read the more I realized that it was not really two stories alternated, but one continuous narrative, that Ruth's portions could not be separated from Nao's. (view spoiler)[ There was so much preparation for Ruth's dream encounter with Nao's father, Haruki, that it wasn't deus ex machina at all. Early on Ruth had two dreams of Jiko. There was the time discussion where Oliver reminds Ruth of the ten years that had passed from the writing of the journal to the present. There were the statements of Jiko involving apparent contradictions being equally true and the flow of identity and time. It is ""background"" until the disappearance of words in the journal. (hide spoiler)] 
 I still feel the philosophy was mostly well integrated. Possibly more actual Buddhist early on and more new age when it gets heavier at the end. 
 I could pause and savor the many puns on ""time being,"" such as ""Mind and words are time being. Arriving and not-arriving are time being"" (347). Also enjoyable were the meditations on moments and on ""now/Nao."" 
 While I had intended a second reading eventually, I am glad for my book group selecting the book to prompt me to do it. 
 After the first reading (2014) 
 One of my favorite narrative structures is one that combines a past (through letters or journals) and a present story. And that is the basic structure of this novel. Ruth in the Pacific Northwest on a remote island finds a packet containing a journal and other objects washed up on shore, possibly from the earthquake and tsunami a couple years before, . The chapters alternate between Ruth, the finder and Nao, the writer. At first I wondered why Nao would have written a journal in English--it became clear when she revealed that she had spent her early life in California. 
 The pacing is interesting. Instead of racing through the journal, Ruth paces herself slowly to reflect the pace it was written. In addition there is a French journal and some letters in old Japanese--these do not get translated immediately, but add essential information when they do. 
 The characters are well drawn, sometimes interesting, sometimes ordinary. Sometimes likable sometimes less so--but as more is revealed, the major characters become more likable. The minor ones, the school contemporaries, not so much. At one point in the middle I found myself wondering about Ruth's chapters. Would her story be worth a novel without having found the journal? What were the parallels that were going to pull the two narratives together? I may reread it and focus more on Ruth, though the natural focus is Nao. 
 Science, philosophy and religion were woven into the novel, generally not too heavily, though heavier at the end. The novel is a kind of exploration of time, of existences, of influence. How seriously are we to take the question of who is creating whom? I was intrigued by the moments of magical realism, though I have not yet decided if they were integral or an easy solutions to narrative problems. (view spoiler)[ Was the happy ending believable? Contrived? I realize ""happy"" may be a stretch since the father and daughter may have perished in the tsunami--this possibility leads to calling it ironic rather than happy; however, the question remains about Ruth's intervention in the father's intended suicide. (hide spoiler)] And did I learn about Buddhism or New Age cooptations of Buddhism? I will ponder these when I reread also.

 The pace is leisurely for the first two thirds, then speeds up, the style descriptive and immediate. There were few characters, though towns and other activities were implied. The characters were well developed with flaws and virtues--all but one, who had no redeeming qualities. 
 Much of the book was about ideas never stated (the Orchardist himself, Jane and Della, sometimes Caroline Middey, though she was the most likely to speak) or about inability to speak (Clee). Angeline was more the one who wanted to know than one not communicating. Each had their own type of isolation, though there were also relationships. 
 The novel deals with aging, birth, the growing up of children, and the diminished abilities of the elderly, always matter of factly, sometimes understated. Never heavy handed philosophizing.

 Generally, I like the slow pace of 19C novels, the extended description of setting and person. I like getting drawn into the fictitious world. I like the battles of wits and psychological studies. And this novel has those. 
 I like that the novel is narrated as if it were a memoir, written (we learn at the end) ten years after most events. 
 I dislike the hints of Beauty and the Beast mythology in Jane and Rochester. Yes, he does get tamed and become likeable; but I get tired of seeing women put into the civilizing role. 
 I tolerated the moralizing via various characters as part of 19C until we came to St John. He was just too preachy and went on way too long. At first I shrugged it off as part of his character, and I hypothesized that Bronte was mocking him in presenting it to excess, especially when he claims that he has God's will for someone else, for Jane, who had no such internal push to become a missionary. Then I came to the ending of the novel and wondered why it ended with him, his anticipation of death told in Revelation terms. Was this meant to elevate him? To make this the lesson for all from the novel? Was it meant to say he had never changed? That it did say, but why end thus? Is even the end part of the mockery of his approach to life--mocking importance to a self important man? 
 Another place that did not work for me was Rochester's narration of his past to Jane after the wedding has been called off. Mere telling went on way too long. 
 I also could not believe that the feisty Jane could be almost persuaded by St John. Yes Bronte did try to make it believable by Jane's saying that she was docile and obedient until a certain level of resistance had been reached and then she would fight back. And as a child she had been excessively obedient, but then she had grown out of it. So I wasn't convinced that she remained in character. Of course, her being almost persuaded did add to the drama. It would have done so more had it been believable. 
 In spite of features, which to me seemed faults, overall it was a good read.",Sun Aug 05 18:55:42 -0700 2012,Tue Aug 21 14:03:16 -0700 2012,Tue Aug 21 14:03:16 -0700 2012,Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 -0700 2012,1,0

 A NICO POV AND SOME PIPER ACTION

 -unresolved questions (""What happens to Apollo? The Hunters and Amazons and how did they escape from Orion?? How about freaking Leo? FREAKING FREAKING LEO!!!"") 
 -abrupt ending (wait...that's it? everything's all fine and all and bam! another cliffhanger. Great, jusst great.) 
 -no Gaea action - i know the whole five books was the Gaea action ITSELF but if we think really deep about it, we don't know much about Gaea. I know they had to kill her fast and all, but still. At least the gods were fighting side by side with their children! I almost cried.

 -the awesome battle scenes!!!! 
 -nico's happy ending with will solace <333 
 -SOLANGELO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 -jason and his glasses 
 -leo's references 
 -percy's nosebleed

 Okay regarding about my baby, Nico di Angelo, this is what I think: Nico was trapped inside a Lotus hotel guys. Then sent to a boarding school (it was a boarding school right) and he was a geeky kid back then obsessed with his cards. Percy was the first ""hero"" (probably) he had seen in action. An inspiration, admiratioN!!! HE TRUSTED PERCY. LIKE REALLY TRUSTED HIM! HE'S NOT EVEN THE GEEKY KID HE WAS BEFORE, HE'S MORE MATURE AND HE GOT HOTTER HAHAAH ANYWAYS that's not my point. If you love Nico for who he is then you should respect him for his ""feelings"" (as he quoted) Oh my god I just respect Nico so much more now! 
 To summarize it: I am a dedicated fangirl to Nico di Angelo. 
 Comments about the last book because man it took me 4 days to finish this book thanks to school -_______- 
 1. Leo will have a freaking girlfriend, okay, Rick Riordan?! He will fall in love even deeply with (view spoiler)[ Calypso (hide spoiler)] AND THEY'LL BE HAPPY TOGETHER OK. 
 2. I hope Piper will have like a major development in the last book though I'm not a fan of her she's still one of the seven and she wasn't given more screen time. 
 3. Hmm.. a prediction about something war related will probably be the resurrection of Bob/another comrade. 
 4. I don't know how they're planning to destroy Gaia/Gaea. In the end our main characters always win.

Unexpectedly, I actually liked The Raven Boys . I was captivated by the story of each one of the boys and Blue and my vocabulary expanded as well. 
 This year, in The Dream Thieves , I learned new words as well (Thank God I read this in the kindle because I have a dictionary to define the words I didn't really understand.) just like last year. But other than that, I got to take a closer look on my most favorite Raven boy, Ronan Lynch!! 
 (Now that I think about it, Gansey is the only one who does not have the ""supernatural power"" as I would like to call it. Maybe something will happen in the next book?) 
 Gansey was the main lead of The Raven Boys if I'm not mistaken. In The Dream Thieves , it was Ronan and I got to learn lots about his family. Ronan is a Greywaren, just like his late father. He can procure things out from his dreams. But! - He's not the only Greywaren in town. Enter Joseph Kavinsky (Is he gay? I'm so confused) who can do the same tricks and schemes as Ronan. He ""teaches"" Ronan how to control his dreams, but eventually, Ronan ditches him because well we all know that Ronan and Gansey are inseparable. 
 Adam also has a little bit of tree conversing going on. In the last book, he sacrificed himself to Cabeswater so apparently he's like the ""eyes"" and ""hands"" (If I remember correctly??) of the whole place, which I think is pretty neat. In my opinion, Adam is the one who suffers deeply. He was abused by his father, lives his life working on 3 jobs, and he was rejected by Blue (ouch). I'm not going to blame Blue, though. 
 Speaking of Blue, nothing really much happened in her point of view in the story. (Maybe something will in the next book??) Looking back, I really wished something did. The only interesting parts was when she kissed Noah (Don't worry, he's dead) and was almost kissed by Gansey. Will Blue finally realize that Gansey may be the one who might die in her kiss? 
 But hey, Kavinsky is not the only new character in The Dream Thieves ! Enter The Gray Man, a hit man who is certainly gray - from his hair to his clothes. His job throughout the whole book was to find the Greywaren. Only, he didn't know the Greywaren is a who . Along the way, he falls in love with Blue's mother, Maura! 
 The only thing that is keeping me hanging is the disappearance of Maura at the end of the book. What the heck is this: Glendower is underground. So am I.

 -Probably some people are tired of it, but I enjoy the ""fillers"" or the adventures they go through that distract their quest. I guess they aren't really fillers but sometimes there were some that weren't really needed hahahaha 
 -Just like the other people, Nico's revelation was a huge thing for me. Because I love Nico and his everything, I kept on fangirling a few hours ago in school because... I was too excited!! 
 -Winner of Character Development goes to.......Frank! He fought hundreds of cows by himself, got a major makeover, and ordered dead soldiers around! Impressed by Frank in this book, go, go, go Frank! 
 -The adventures of Percy and Annabeth were the major highlight of this book for me. I enjoyed their POVs and Bob and Small Bob. 
 SAD! :( 
 -I don't like Piper tbh but she wasn't given the amount of screentime just like everyone else isn't that kind of unfair? 
 -Rick Riordan, are you running out of ideas? Just like when Khione made that pun about Jason? I didn't feel the excitement in this book, the humor, the comedy, and that just makes me sad! 
 -Idk if its just me but everyone has a personality except for Jason and Piper. Also I feel like Percy is so far away ... probably because I was used to his POVs in the past books. :( 
 ""We're staying together,"" he promised. ""You're not getting away from me. Never again."" 
 Only then did she understand what would happen. A one-way trip. A very had fall. 
 ""As long as we're together,"" she said."" 
 She heard Nico and Hazel still screaming for help. She saw the sunlight far, far above-maybe the last sunlight she would ever see.

 ""I said,"" Percy repeated, ""Frank is turning into a crazy dolphin!"" 
 ""Incredible,"" Jason said. ""These are really good brownies."" 
 ""That's your only comment?"" Piper demanded. 
 The eidolons started pounding on the gates again. 
 ""Who is it?"" Leo called. 
 ""Valdez!"" Wolf Head bellowed. 
 ""Valdez who?"" Leo asked. 
 Percy smiled at her - that sarcastic, troublemaker smile that had annoyed her for years but eventually had become endearing. His sea-green eyes were as gorgeous as she remembered. His dark hair was swept to one side, like he'd just come from a walk on the beach. He looked even better than he had six months ago - tanner and taller, leaner and more muscular. 
 Frank waved his left dorsal fin. 'Sup? 
 Percy yelled, ""What's going -Gah! Shrimpzilla!"" 
 They were alone expect for Coach Hedge, who was back on the quarterdeck singing the Pokemon theme song. The coach had changed the words to: Gotta Kill 'Em All, and Leo really didn't want to know why. 
 ""Behold!"" Percy shouted. ""The god's chosen beverage. Tremble before the horror of Diet Coke!"" 
 Leo couldn't help smiling. ""That could be fun."" 
 ""Fun,"" she said unhappily. 
 ""Blue elephants."" 
 ""Blue elephants."" 
 ""Kiss me, you fool."" 
 ""You fool."" 
 ""Hey!"" 
 ""A son of Ares stood here!"" Hedge cried indignantly. 
 ""I'm Roman ... so Mars, actually."" 
 ""Whatever! Famous spot in the American Civil War!"" 
 ""I'm Canadian, actually."" 
 Piper twisted the feather in her hair. ""Like water leaking through a dam,"" she suggested. 
 ""Yeah."" Percy smiled. ""We've got a dam hole."" 
 ""What?"" Piper asked. 
 ""Nothing,' he said. ""Inside joke."" 
 ""You dropped this,"" he said, totally poker-faced. 
 Annabeth threw her arms around him. ""I love you!"" 
 ""This is Buford,"" Leo announced. 
 ""You name your furniture?"" Frank asked. 
 Hazel was looking at him strangely, the way she had during the feast in the forum-like she was searching for something in his face. He was tempted to ask if they had met before, but he was sure they hadn't. He would remember a pretty girl paying such close attention to him. That didn't happen a lot. 
 He squinted at it. ""What is-?"" 
 ""Chinese handcuffs,"" Percy said. 
 Frank, who was Chinese Canadian, looked offended. ""How is this Chinese?"" 
 Hazel and Piper had stopped the shaking fits. They were sitting on the deck, staring at Percy, but when he glared at them pointedly, they started hamming it up again, trembling and flopping around like a fish. 
 ""I'm the Super-sized McShizzle, man!"" Leo said. ""I'm Leo Valdez, bad boy supreme. And ladies love a bad boy.""",Sun Oct 21 03:35:15 -0700 2012,Wed Oct 31 03:37:49 -0700 2012,Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 -0700 2012,Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 -0700 2012,0,2

 my 
 gosh 
 what the heck happened? 
 so in the cover of the book, The New York Times says "" Brilliant and hugely ambitious.... It's the kind of book that can be LIFE CHANGING"" 
 i made a shelf just for this book labelled as ""life-changing"" because honestly, it was really life changing. 
 550 pages of words from the mouth of death written by 14 year old liesel meminger was worth it. i'm proud to read liesel's story, because honestly, she had a better adeventure than me. 
 so what i understood from the book: hitler's time, nazi germany. liesel writes down her life called the book thief because she has stolen books, her first stealing after her mother and her buried her brother. liesel's mom abandoned her, and she now lives with a man who plays the accordion and a woman who swears a lot. she begins to have a close relationship with a boy whose hair is the color of lemons, and a jew who is hiding under the basement. liesel's story is narrated by death. it is split into ten parts and the titles come from the book titles she read/stolen. 
 i love all of the characters. you cannot hate anyone in the book. i love the figures of speech. i love that there was a different story to tell in each chapter/part. i loved the ending, the sad, sad ending. 
 what else can i say? the book was life-changing in different ways. i guess it's kind of embarrassing to answer why because well... 
 anyways, this book is perfection. this needs to be a movie, i ll cry rivers.",Fri Oct 19 21:52:34 -0700 2012,Fri Oct 11 04:43:00 -0700 2013,Mon Sep 16 00:00:00 -0700 2013,Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 -0800 2012,0,0

 OKAY SO WHAT IS BURN FOR BURN? ((MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)) 
 It is about three different girls (oOOoo interesting) who plot revenge. Lillia, that girl you see in the popular clique, plots revenge on one of her friends, Alex, because Lillia suspects him for hooking up with her sister. 
 Kat (or Katherine) is that girl who smokes and has a broken family. She's plotting revenge against Rennie, Lillia's best friend, for they were a trio before, and now have broken up because of Rennie's lies. 
 AND Mary is that pretty girl you think is perfect, but nope, she has a past. She plotting revenge against Reeve, a QB and part of the popular clique. 
 I like how each character is sort of related to one another, and how each character has a role or significance whatsoever. Did I like the book? Well, it was a pretty light book filled with vengeance and pretty girls who get even and I read it in 24 hours. 
 HECK YEAH I LIKED THE BOOK! 
 I'm pretty sure I saw this book in the paranormal section, and during the ending of the book, I guess I know understand why such high school teen fiction is in the paranormal section. (Guessing) 
 So why did I give this book four stars .... that is because it was SO FAST! I WANT MORE. AND WHY WAS LILLIA'S REVENGE LONGER THAN MARY AND KAT'S? D: I'm sorry I don't like Lillia okay. 
 AND because I hate Lillia, this is why the duo authors are great authors! Making me hate a fiction character and that character is the popular girl, I commend you! 
 Okay so I need a better reason for giving four stars... hmm... let's just look at the bright points! 
 1) Personality is shown very well. 
 2) Those teacher scenes are not shown and I'm happy because sometimes those scenes are sooo boring. 
 3) Real-life problems are shown. (view spoiler)[ well maybe expect for Mary's ""supernatural power"" or whatever she can do (hide spoiler)] 
 4) As I said, every character has their own role in the book so no character gets left behind! :) 
 5) THE COVER. 
 Okay, I have know have my dislike list: 
 1) Lillia in the cover. (FYI, I'm Asian, Chinese in fact. Is Lillia suppose to be Chinese?) 
 2) The ending. (view spoiler)[ DOES MARY HAVE POWERS OR NOT? (hide spoiler)] 
 3) Mary's POVs. (Because it's so short and Mary is my favorite character. AND WHEN IT IS LONG THOUGH, she talks about her past with Reeve. smmh. But I guess that's personality? Oh well) 
 4)Lillia 
 I WOULD SOO read the next book (Fire for Fire, am I right?) I want the duo to answer my questions: 
 1.) Is Mary from a family of those supernatural people or something? 
 2.) What the heck happens to Reeve? (KARMA!) 
 3.) What happens to Alex and Lillia? 
 4.) When will Rennie finally admit how trashy she is? (Trash coming from Kat's words) 
 5.) If Alex and Lillia are hooking up, will you(authors) make a better sexy character for Kat? 
 6.)Will Mary ever think about committing suicide again? 
 Thoughts during the period of reading the book. 
 I like Mary so far :] *going to edit this* 
 Wait what 
 WHY IS MARY'S POV SO SHORT? :( 
 Oh well I guess that's character personality? 
 I don't like Lillia at all, I'm sorry, but the cover girl Lillia in the book cover doesn't seem matching. She looks like a bookworm in the cover. 
 But I really like that writing. I'm hating on Lillia so much. Can't she just speak for herself? Smmh.

 The Raven Boys is about Blue, daughter of a psychic though Blue doesn't have these psychic powers, and 4 boys who go to Aglionby who are branded as raven boys because that's the school's logo. Ever since she was little, Blue has been told that she will kill her true with with a kiss. And every April 24th, St. Mark's Eve, souls of people walk in the corpse road and these people will die within the year. Blue is shocked to actually see a soul of a person, and this person is Gansey, who is interested in the corpse road (or ley lines) and is searching for Glendower. 
 I like the fact that there was only a pinch of romance, I also like the fact that there was brotherly love (kidding) and parent problems. I like the fact that I want more of the raven boys (all three four of them. They seem hot and perfect and rich but all of them have their flaws (even Ronan) 
 Ladies and gentlemen, this book will totally impress you. It impress me. During the three weeks I have learned new vocabulary and how awesome magic is. I'm pretty sure there is a second book, right? This book also makes me wonder who Blue will end up with (despite her curse) and how the book will end. 
 Also, this book has film rights so it's not surprising if this book is successful in the movie world. Ahhh, now excuse me, I'm going to dream about my dream cast.",Fri Sep 07 02:45:19 -0700 2012,Wed Oct 24 18:58:03 -0700 2012,Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 -0700 2012,Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 -0700 2012,0,0

 Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar was published last year and written by Ransom Riggs. I just finished it minutes ago and I want to review about what I thought about the book. 
 First of all, the story is about Jacob Portman who grew up listening to his grandfather's stories, but then several years later as he grew up her began to not believe his ""fairy tales"" and treated him like everybody else. Though one day, his grandfather gets attacked by ""monsters"" and he tells Jacob to go to a woman named Miss Peregrine. He discovers the secrets his grandfather never told him before he died, and that the fairy tales are real -- and they are alive. 
 The story was a mixed of the ordinary life and the strange life. For me, it was a bit dragging. The author just didn't go straight to the point. Jacob's character was not expressed well. I love all of the characters of this book, their talents and the fact that they are really peculiar. The book is rather dark and fun at the same time. The book only has 11 chapters and because of that I was getting bored. All in all, the book was splendid written, and peculiar. I suggest everyone to read this book 
 OK, 11 months later, I can say that this book was not my cup of tea. The only interesting features about this book are the pictures, probably because there are a lot of YA books without pictures. As I said 11 months ago, it was ""dragging"" and I was ""getting bored.""",Mon Jun 04 22:52:58 -0700 2012,Mon Jan 07 02:52:15 -0800 2013,Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2011,,0,0

Some stories were far superior than others though, so the collection wasn't anything amazing. But then again, these types of books rarely are. 
 Anyways, so I started mini reviewing each individual short story but I got lazy for the last 3 or 4 so... 
 1. Midnights by Rainbow Rowell - 2.5 stars 
 Eh, this story was okay. I thought Noel was o.k. too. I will admit that it did suck to read (view spoiler)[ through watching someone's crush constantly kiss everyone but them (hide spoiler)] 
 2. The Lady and the Fox by Kelly Link - 3.5 stars 
 I liked this one, it was cute, if not a little confusing concerning the time period and the ending, but maybe that's just me. 
 3. Angels in the Snow by Matt de la Pena - 4.5 stars 
 This one grew on me. I didn't really care for it at first, I initially thought (view spoiler)[ ""Oh great, another biracial story where the white person savior rescues the poor poc (hide spoiler)]. Thankfully, it wasn't really like that...kinda-ish, Anyways, I was smitten by the end of it and I actually cared about the characters. It was cute. 
 4. Polaris is Where You'll Find Me by Jenny Han - 4 stars 
 Okay first off, what?? What was that?! How are you just going to leave me hanging like that?! Where's my closure? Who am I suppose to root for? Anyways, I wasn't expecting to like this story b/c I didn't like ""The Summer I Turned Pretty,"" which was written by this author, but I actually thought the concept was cool and I love me some Asian representation. IDK if the author's writing improved or this story was just extremely short so there wasn't much there, either way, good job. 
 5. It's A Yueltide Miracle, Charlie Brown by Stephanie Perkins - 4.5 stars 
 This was just cute. And yay, more Asian representation! I will say though, that I can tell a white person wrote this because ""Most non-Asian-Americans were terrible guessers. They'd say Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese before Chinese."" Okay, stop right there. As an Asian American I promise you that that statement is false. They always assume you're Chinese. Always . 
 6. Your Temporary Santa by David Leviathan - 1.5 stars 
 Eh, this was okay. Didn't really care for it. Seemed more like an introspection on want and longing rather than a cute Holiday themed short story. 
 7. Krampuslauf by Holly Black - 4 stars 
 I liked it. We all need friends like Wren. 
 8. What the hell have you done, Sophie Roth? by Gayle Forman - 3.5 stars 
 This was my most anticipated story out of the bunch, just b/c Gayle Forman is my favorite author from this collection. So far, definitely the best writing. The story wasn't amazing or anything, though. 
 9. Beer Buckets and Baby Jesus by Myra Mcentire - 3 stars 
 Eh, didn't like the protagonist's voice at first, but I acclimated as the story went on. It was alright. 
 10. Welcome to Christmas, CA by Kiersten White - 3.5 stars 
 This story was nice, if not a bit cheesy at the end. 
 11. Star of Bethlehem by Ally Carter - 4.5 stars rounded to 5. 
 Okay, this one caught me by surprise. The most interesting one for sure, and I loved it. Although the ending was pretty cheesy. Still, I have to say this was my favorite story out of the collection. 
 12. The Girl Who Woke the Dreamer by Laini Taylor - 2.5 stars 
 Considering the books that this author wrote, I wasn't even surprised to see the story had supernatural elements. It was alright, definitely not a strong enough ending to close out the collection.",Tue Jun 17 20:51:21 -0700 2014,Thu Dec 15 15:57:31 -0800 2016,Thu Dec 15 15:57:31 -0800 2016,Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 -0800 2016,1,0

 Welp, after reading it a second time, I lower my rating from 3.5 stars to just 3 stars. The beginning was kind of boring and the writing style was just not doing it for. The end got better though, I'm still a sucker for Sizzy. Also, I can now say that this whole thing is definitely just a joke and is in no way meant to be taken seriously.

I also thought both the movie and the book were overrated. Plus, it didn't help that I didn't really like the art style. Clemetine's and Emma's relationship didn't really seem to have much depth to me, except for the fact that they were physically and eventually emotionally attracted to each other (imo the book doesn't do a good job of showing how their relationship develops and adapts).

 I am happy to say that this book was amazing. I really loved the writing and the story was so interesting! There was non-stop political intrigue it was almost overwhelming. Luckily, I love political intrigue. I also loved the protagonist, Elizabeth Woodsville, and I had a love/hate relationship with Edward. So much happened in this book, I felt like I read a novel's worth of plot just in the first 100 pages alone.

Thankfully, it was. The abrupt chapters and switching povs was off-putting at first, but it grows on you and really works later on in adding tension and suspense. 
 The first half of the book started slow, I had to push myself to read through the beginning. The book picks up though, as you begin to read further and begin to understand what this book actually is: It's a book about war and I thought it was incredibly interesting to have a point of view from the French resistance and a point of view from a German boy brainwashed and forced to fight a war. Yes there is a ""villain"" in this book, but it was mostly just a story about living through a war. I think the book becomes incredibly enjoyable when you accept that the story is just about the lives of certain characters and how everything can be connected. 
 I felt like the book was specifically written to be poignant but I wasn't entirely convinced. This book wasn't perfect, but I read 400 pages in one day and stayed up until 2am to finish it and I felt utterly affected by it at the end and that says something. (It doesn't hurt that I was listening to some brilliant music and became swept up into a wistful state, which certainly just enhanced my experience while reading this book).",Wed May 21 14:59:01 -0700 2014,Fri Aug 04 16:15:23 -0700 2017,Sun Sep 13 01:54:02 -0700 2015,Thu Sep 10 00:00:00 -0700 2015,0,0

 I devoured this book. The writing was gorgeous and the book was very atmospheric and had this supernatural/eerie sense to it (at least imo) throughout. 
 Unforunately, I thought the last 1/4 or even 1/3 of the book was rather lackluster (I give the first half of the book 5 stars and the last 1/3 like, maybe 2.5 stars) - the ending also left me feeling unsatisfied, but because I enjoyed the previous parts so much, I decided to round my rating up to 5 stars instead of 4.

It was a great fantasy book and the romance is so cute, subtle, and intimate, yet at the same time tasteful; it made me feel like I was intruding. The only flaw that initially comes to mind and stands to me though, is the pacing. Just the journey took up most of the book and the final confrontation was kind of short.

The relationship felt very real and organic and I love how one of the main conflicts was the inner conflict of ""this is wrong but it feels so right"" kind of thing. Liza, the main character, lives during a time when homosexuality was not accepted AT ALL, yet she's still brave enough to follow her feelings. Her bravery isn't in-your-face-telling-not-showing, rather, it's very subtle and I loved that. At times (mostly near the end), I noticed the book was kind of preachy (as in, the author obviously telling the overall theme/life lesson through dialogue through the characters) which I know is in a lot of books, but I felt maybe the author was trying a bit too hard.

 Let's start off with the fact that I came into this book completely blind; I had no idea what this book was about. In fact, for some reason I had this notion that this book was going to be about mental illness. 
 So, seeing as how I came into this book knowing nothing about it, imagine my surprise when I started reading it and I read nonsense. Turns out, this book is filled with a made up language based off of Russian slang. I saw some reviews praising the author for making the slang accessible and easy to follow and learn. All I have to say about that is 'speak for yourself.' I had no idea how to read this and I was barely getting along until I finally looked up a glossary and memorized a few of the more commonly used words. 
 Besides the difficulty I faced in reading this book, I guess I just don't ""get it."" The ultraviolence turned me off, which I guess was the point, however, I know a lot of people felt sorry for Alex and what he went through, well, not me. I'm not saying he deserved everything he got, but he deserved a lot of it. He was a borderline psychopath who got off on violence and being an overall shitty human being. I have no sympathy for what he went through. I think what made me lose any and all compassion I might have had for him is when he (view spoiler)[ got two 10 year old girls drunk, brought them home, then raped them. (hide spoiler)] 
 I don't get the theme warning about government control and whatever -- maybe they crossed the line but it's hard to care when the only example of that we're showed is what happened to Alex. 
 Overall, I thought this book sucked. I almost gave up after page 20 but I powered through thinking about all the good reviews on goodreads. In hindsight, I should have just read wikipedia. This book was a real pain in the ass to read. If anyone wants to try and explain to me whatever I'm not seeing, that'd be nice. Can't say I'd agree with you, though.",Wed Sep 04 22:12:56 -0700 2013,Wed Sep 27 10:24:28 -0700 2017,Thu Aug 24 12:12:50 -0700 2017,Sun Aug 20 00:00:00 -0700 2017,1,0

I was around page 100 and I was still pretty bored and I was about to just turn it in to the library without finishing it. i kept reading and I admit that it got better, though some cases were still boring.

I didn't want to get my hopes up for fear that this book would suck even though it had high ratings (a la TFiOS); thankfully, that was not the case. I actually really liked the writing and I liked the characters and the dynamics. I'm glad for the Asian representation, even if Park is only half Asian. Personally, I felt like the first half of the book was better than the second half. I'm not quite sure that I understand Eleanor at the end but, oh well. I was able to read this book in about a day, give or take, so it's a pretty quick read. I didn't really feel anything at the ending, so I'm not quite sure what the author was aiming for...maybe a bittersweet ending? But honestly, it didn't have to be. I'm not saying it should have been a happily ever after thing, but I don't really agree with a character's actions in the end and I kind of feel like they acted that way just so the ending would be bittersweet. 
 The romance got a little cliche and eye-roll inducing at times, when the author was being poetic or poignant but other than that it was pretty solid and cute.

 3.5 stars. Okay. This book was a pretty solid 4 stars until the ending. I mean, if you read this book for what it is, you'll really enjoy it. What it is is a nice, easy, mindless, chick-lit book. It's a fast, easy read full of fluff and light teenage angst. So, I accepted that fact and I really enjoyed the book. The writing made me chuckle sometimes out loud but there were also times where I thought it was pretty cheesy (even for a chick-lit) and wondered if a guy really acted that way or would say that. Usually books with characters like these just annoy the crap out of me but somehow when Lauren Barnholdt writes them it's okay. Now, let's move on to the ending/my rant. Seriously, this book went from a solid 4 stars to 3/3.5 stars. I mean, I'd give the ending itself 2 stars. Obviously I said not to expect much from this book but I seriously expected more than what it is. Let me explain. Jace and Peyton hook up for one day but it's this crazy, out of this world, amazing day. Then they talk and whatnot. Then one day, Jace stops talking to her, and therefore, breaks up with her (even though they technically weren't even dating). And it's like Jace and Peyton still aren't over each other *cue eye roll* and somehow they end up on this sorta, kinda road trip together. Oh, and you find out they broke up because of this ""secret"" that Peyton kept from Jace...prepare for the ranting (It will most definitely contain spoilers so...) (view spoiler)[ It turns out the ""secret"" that Peyton kept from Jace was that her parents were getting a divorce. (hide spoiler)] What. The. Actual. Fuck. Okay, here's where I have a problem with this book. I was willing to overlook the fact that Peyton and Jace are unrealistically obsessed with each other after one day but I will not overlook this. Like, SERIOUSLY? THAT'S WHY HE WAS PISSED OFF AT HER? Are you fucking kidding me? Well, first off Jace, considering you guys only went on one date, it's no fucking wonder she didn't tell you (view spoiler)[ that her parents were getting a divorce (hide spoiler)]. She barely fucking knows you. She didn't even tell ANYONE yet, not even her best friend, or close family members, and you fucking expect her to tell you something that personal?! It obviously must devastate her. Why the fuck would you feel like she was obligated to tell you? It wasn't even a secret in a sense. It was her not ready to fucking share everything with you. That's so fucking stupid. If that was me I'd tell the guy to fuck off. Not like I owe it to him to tell him something that's personal and none of his business, especially if I've only known him for a few months. 
 Also, Peyton was just so stupid. Why the fuck she didn't tell her dad, or anyone, that (view spoiler)[ her mom stole her identity (hide spoiler)] is beyond me. Yeah, I get it. that sucks. It was out of nowhere and how the hell do you confront a parent? But seriously, your dad is a fucking option! HELLO?! I mean, yeah, take some time to digest it but completely doing nothing about it and ""running away"" is just ridiculous. How old is she again? 
 And Jordan giving that advice to Jace? Do teenage guys even think like that? And Jace and Peyton's povs sounded really similar. 
 There are plenty more things to complain about but I think it'll just take all day. I gave Two-Way Street (a similar book by the same author) 5 stars because I read it years ago when I was much younger and my tastes were not yet as mature and refined as they are now (pfft hahahahahaha. yeah right. like I can actually use the words mature and refined to describe myself. Probably more accurate to say I've slightly matured from pre-teen to young adult teen and therefore, now enjoy deeper reads.I still enjoy chick-lit every now and then though.), and the book was easy to read (I started and finished it on a Saturday morning) but I'm pretty sure if I re-read it now the rating would go down. Still, if you read the book for what it is and aren't expecting anything above superficiality then you'll be able to enjoy the book. 
 Plus there were a lot of things that didn't have closure. Also, why the heck even have B.J. in the book? And that scene with Jace's mom. Talk about cheesy and unrealistic. 
 Also the cameos with Courtney and Jordan seemed to be there just so they would have a cameo in the book. Lame.",Sun Feb 03 21:15:46 -0800 2013,Tue Jul 22 18:58:00 -0700 2014,Tue Jul 22 00:00:00 -0700 2014,Sun Jul 20 00:00:00 -0700 2014,0,0

The writing made me chuckle and smile and while that was sort of embarrassing because sometimes it was in public, I love it when a book/any writing can make me do that. This book is charming (I think I'm beginning to understand how a book can be described as ""charming"") and witty and made me laugh because of the writing.

So, I obviously expected this book to be amazing. I was wrong. It was boring, lackluster, and plain. First off, the pacing. Literally nothing, NOTHING, happens in this book. Oh you can argue with that point but whatever. I first realized that nothing happened at around page 100 when Puck had FINALLY decided to register in the race on her regular horse. It's ridiculous that it took that long. Why? Because it's unnecessary and BECAUSE IT'S EXPLAINED IN THE SYNOPSIS. Ugh. Such a bad move. Then I read 300 more pages and I got near the end when finally, FINALLY, the race actually started. 
 ...Are you kidding me? The WHOLE book is superficial and composed of NOTHING. Seriously!! I get it, the men discriminate against you, Puck, because you're a girl. I understood that concept the first time it happened. No need to shove it in my face every chapter. You and Sean have this crazy love for horses that no one else apparently understands. Gotcha. Oh yeah, and it's a BIG deal because you're the first/only girl to decide to do this. Yeah, I GOT THE MEMO. The idea that a girl takes the first initiative to end something that has long time been a male dominated activity used to be original but now it's become cliche, expected even! The author literally could have written this book in like 100 pages or less. Seriously. (Also, the reason that Puck joined the races is incredibly stupid and shallow. Seriously? It's not believable enough for me.) 
 The author writes this book in alternating point of views. Puck and Sean. A.k.a. the female protagonist who is defying gender roles blah blah blah (not that that's not important but the way it was written was quite honestly, lame) and the male love interest (oh please, that's not even a spoiler. Seriously, did anyone NOT expect them to get together?) because you've got to add a little romance in here *sarcasm*. My main complaint with this style choice is that the tone of the povs ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. Sean and Puck sound exactly.the.same. I shit you not, I'm not even exaggerating or anything. I swear. Honest. I mean, if you're going to write multiple povs you HAVE to write them so they're different from one another (I think Rick Riordan is a GREAT example of this. His characters in the HoO series [while not all likable, at least to me] definitely all have unique voices. It's practically impossible to get them mixed up). Seriously, it's only two characters! You seriously couldn't create two different personalities? I mean, there's this one page where Sean remarks on how handsome this American guy is (another thing, the author created this world and decided to incorporate it somehow with reality. It's weird and awkward, at least for me). Do guys even do that?! 
 I did enjoy the ending but it definitely DOES NOT make up for reading a whole book worth of nothing. The ending, while pleasing, isn't even surprising either. It's expected. Not good. 
 This book unfortunately lacks originality. It falls into that young-adult-book category (I can't think of the word right now). Y'know, when all young adult books seem to follow this pattern? Boy-meets-girl or vice versa and they bond and they get together at the end and everything works out happily ever after after stumbling over a few conflicts here or there. I can't articulate myself right now but...yeah.",Tue Jan 15 17:55:06 -0800 2013,Thu Apr 23 19:42:03 -0700 2015,Fri May 02 00:00:00 -0700 2014,Wed Apr 23 00:00:00 -0700 2014,0,0

 I was surprised to find out that this book had multiple povs, not just August (a.k.a. Auggie, our protagonist and main character). Those other povs turned out to be my favorite part of the book. It was a very clever addition that worked out because the other povs give us insight in how other people perceive August's facial deformities. It works so well because the author was spot on in her characterization of the characters. Their thoughts and their actions were 100% accurate/realistic and completely reflect how kids (and even adults) would act or think. Honestly, reading this transported me back to when I was in elementary school and I honestly emphasize so much. I was definitely one of those kids who didn't partake in bullying but I wouldn't stand up for the person either (I'm ashamed to say). 
 Kids and adults alike will enjoy this book and the message resonates no matter how old one may be. Everyone should be reminded of the message of this book and I genuinely think if I ever have a child/children I'm going to give them this book to read. I honestly teared up like twice throughout this book, but I'm a big sap, so. 
 Also, the book I was reading had an extra ""Julian"" chapter and while I think it was a nice touch it wasn't as resonating or good as the main book imo, but maybe I'm being too harsh.",Tue Jan 01 17:37:26 -0800 2013,Sun Oct 02 14:05:25 -0700 2016,Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 -0700 2016,Sun Nov 29 00:00:00 -0800 2015,1,0

For some reason, the last 1/5 didn't seem as exciting, it might have been due to the fact that I was rushing to finish this book in a week (which I did). Anyways, what I loved so much about this book was that there was so much political intrigue and definitely some game-changing reveals (view spoiler)[ Aegon Targaryen is alive? Holy shit! If it comes down to him or Daenerys taking the throne I want Dany, all the way. (hide spoiler)]. Also, Daenerys was a BAMF (as usual), Jon Snow was actually interesting for once, Tyrion was witty as always, (view spoiler)[ apparently Arya can see again (hide spoiler)], the povs from non-main characters were actually well done and less boring, and there was no Sam and barely any Bran, so yay for that. I wished we caught up with Sansa. 
 Again, though, I have doubts that George RR Martin can wrap up this series in 2 more books without it feeling rushed, cheap, or filled with a shit ton of plot holes. A large part is due to the snail's pace of the story. Seriously, after the first book it's been 4 books of gradual, slooooooowww buildup of the plot and we've still yet to reach the climax.

 There's a lot of sex and rape in this book, way more than in Game of Thrones from what I remember. The book started off pretty slow, the whole thing just felt like 1000 pages of set-up/filler with a very small foray into the introduction of magic, barely building upon what was introduced in GOT. The slow pacing of the book and the fact that it seemed like there were a lot of words but not a lot happening makes me want to just start watching the show, books be damned. Honestly, the only reason I'm going to continue reading the series is the sole reason that it's GOT; if it were any other series I would just stop here. 
 Also I felt like Tyrion had more than half of the povs in the book, definitely way more than any other character. Tyrion's a cool and interesting character but I was getting a little tired of reading through his povs because he just had so many.",Mon Dec 24 13:20:59 -0800 2012,Sun Jan 24 17:22:29 -0800 2016,Sun Jan 03 14:11:45 -0800 2016,Sat Dec 26 00:00:00 -0800 2015,0,0

What.the.hell.kind.of.nickname.is.that? It's suppose to be sweet and endearing but let me tell you, oh let me tell you, IT IS NOT. It's so ridiculous oh my gosh ahahahahahhahahaha)This book is AWFUL. I was excited to read it because the cover was pretty cool and everyone was just raving about this book. Boy, was I disappointed. I don't even know where to start. Let's see, the plot was non-existent and was composed of Abby(protagonist) trying to resist irresistible, bad-boy Travis. It was completely pointless and stupid. Abby is attracted to him for nothing other than his supposedly good looks apparently. The characters were so fucking stupid (actually, the whole book was so fucking stupid.) Girls are attracted to Travis like moths are attracted to lights. They throw themselves at him without a second thought and I don't even understand why because the author doesn't explain it and just leaves it at Travis is hot, girls want to be with him because he's hot. He's not even likable. He's disgusting, he sleeps with any girl who throws herself at him, oh excuse me, he doesn't sleep with ""ugly"" girls apparently. Like, they legit just throw themselves at him! It's so unrealistic! And then of course Abby is the girl who changes his ways (cue exaggerated eye-roll). And Abby is the *only* girl who doesn't throw herself at him and doesn't want to sleep with him (spoiler: she actually does) and Travis is just dumbfounded and of course that means he has to find a way to get her to sleep with him. So Abby pretends she's resistant to his charm when she's not and is just playing hard to get just because. Like, she doesn't even have a reason. And then what's his face (I think it's Shep) and Amanda are just so f**king stupid. Shep defends Travis and it's so. I cannot even. UGH. This book. There are other reviews that explain it so much better. Travis isn't worth defending, he has no redeeming qualities and Abby is stupid and just ugh. All the characters in this book are so shallow, superficial and one-dimensional I just can't. Like, the biggest problem in their lives is relationships. Just...I can't believe people worship this book and they worship Travis. You people are the reason there's the misconception that girls only date ""bad-boys"".

Also, me reading this close to Halloween means that I've been reading/watching some scary stuff and since this book is like a mystery/thriller-ish there were some moments I would look around my room, paranoid. Strong debut if you ask me!

And that there were teachers that shitty. This is what you see on tv or in books. It's not real life (hopefully).

 Regina was hard to sympathize with; you feel bad for her, or at least I did, but you also kind of hate her. In a sense, she became a victim of her own abuse. Or as the saying goes, ""you reap what you sow."" The book makes you think (when I say that I mean: it made me think), does Regina deserve what's happening to her? Does she deserve kindness? Personally, what does it say about me, that I enjoyed her petty revenges. That I was rooting for her to get back at Anna and Kara? That I was just as thrilled as she was at playing the same game as Anna and Kara, instead of being the bigger person?

 -the fact that this book felt way too much like a set up for The Dark Artifices 
 -not enough sizzy scenes 
 -way too many povs in the book. Half of them were just plain unnecessary and just muddled the story and dragged it on 
 -that the book is around 700 pages and there are times where it really feels like its lagging 
 -the fact that it feels like I'm missing out on so many references if I'm not caught up in all the shadowhunter facts and family tree and stuff 
 -how Cassandra Clare handled sizzy 
 -how when Mrs. Clare killed off some characters (view spoiler)[ Jordan, Raphael, Maureen etc. (hide spoiler)] it felt really anti-climatic and nonchalant. It didn't really have a huge impact or have any effect at all, really 
 -the book was really angsty, which is fine, if there were enough balance and plot to actually balance it out (it wasn't) 
 -the ending made me furious for a variety of reasons 
 -the fact that when I finished this book I felt worst than before I even started reading it 
 What I liked: 
 -Jace isn't an annoying, arrogant asshole (well, at least not as much as he is in the other books) 
 -Clary isn't as much of a stupid, selfish bitch compared to CoLS 
 -It's TMI (nostalgia really has an effect) 
 My thoughts: 
 I feel like Helen and Aline were in the book for a reason. Like, there were a lot of scenes where they were mentioned, even if it was for a second or two.

 A very strong debut novel. The premise was interesting and I was looking forward to reading this book. I can't believe it took me 5 years since first adding this to my to-read list to finally read it. But, I have, so yay for me. 
 I really like June and I think she's kick ass. Day's pretty awesome too but I enjoyed June's povs more. I'm also iffy about the romance -- it just didn't seem that organic/believable to me. Let's be real, it totally wasn't, but I'm not saying I want slow burn, I just want something that cultivates after a little more time and experience spent together and a little more getting to know you, instead of the ""instant-attraction-I-don't-know-why-but-I'm-just-drawn-to-you"" type thing. Thankfully the romance wasn't that big of a thing so it wasn't too bad. 
 The beginning started off kind of slow (in my opinion) but, as everyone else says, the rest of the book is pretty fast paced and I didn't want to put it down. I agree with someone calling this book a little too formulaic, which is pretty true since that's what I thought when I finished the book. It follows the very tried and true (but still awesome) format of YA dystopian fiction. I'm a little disappointed the book ended where it did -- I was kind of hoping more would happen but I know the author's saving that for the rest of the trilogy. 
 I hope the 2nd and 3rd book are just as good as this book because honestly, YA dystopian trilogies have a tendency to have a kick ass first novel but then once the dystopian world has been established the 2nd and 3rd novel usually tend to take a completely different direction and end up being disappointing (*cough* looking at you Divergent trilogy *cough*). 
 I'm excited to read the next two books. Here's to hoping they're just as good.

No matter how unlikable they are (or seem to be). I loved every. single. one. My favorites just might be Rudy and Ilsa(a.k.a the mayor's wife). Near the end of the book I started bawling. I was crying so hard. And I loved it. I loved that this book evoked that emotion out of me. In fact, I was so overwhelmed that I just had to put the book down and cry. I had to stop reading, put my head down, and just cry. I would then compose myself and start again - only to read the next sentence or two and just burst out in tears again.

 I'm so pleasantly impressed by this book. I came in expecting this to be another YA dystopian novel -- and it is -- but it's so much more. In fact, it reads more like a fantasy novel, including the large world building and huge adventure the protagonist goes on. 
 I didn't like the beginning of the book, the writing took a while to get used to and it was just really slow in the beginning. I also felt like Patrick Ness dragged out the ""secret"" of how boys turn into men a little too long. Also, the whole (view spoiler)[ ""if we can turn you into a killer Todd Hewitt, that proves we'll be able to turn anyone!"" (hide spoiler)] thing was so stupid. There's just not a lot of sense and rationality in that line of thinking, which may be the point but to make that the driving plot point, well, it just doesn't really work. 
 I was surprised to see the length of the book, but like I said, it's almost a fantasy book. In fact, this book really reminds me of the video game ""Fallout 3."" All I could think about was Todd being the main character in this post-apocalyptic world filled with moral ambiguity and a shit ton of guns and killing. It's pretty great and very fitting.

 Okay. I LOVED this book. Daniel Handler's writing is unique and it's great! The characters were (mostly) likable and the whole story/romance didn't come off as unrealistic to me.

Okay, so let's start this review; first off, I loved how the author was able to have several different sub-plots going on at once with all the different characters and not have it all end up in confusion. She pulled it off, which is probably a hard thing to do, but she did it. That's not to say that I didn't have any issues with this book, because there were a lot. First off, it was pretty inconsistent now that I think about it. It's just the little things, like for example (view spoiler)[ Simon and Isabelle's relationship. Honestly, I thought they were already dating by the time this book started but no, they were still in the confusion zone of almost boyfriend and girlfriend, but not quite there yet. Really? Like, even at the end of the book, after all the intimate moments they shared, they're STILL not dating? And neither of them is apparently bright enough to figure out that they both love each other? Did the stuff that happened in the previous books not matter either? That's not to say that their relationship was probably the saving grace of this book for me... (hide spoiler)]. 
 Also, the author uses the same adjectives/phrases for probably every character. Honestly, how many times do you need to tell us Jace is golden, or Sebastian has Valentine's hair and it suits him better than when he dyed it black? 
 And Clary and Jace. Just,...really? REALLY? They were beyond annoying for most of this book, although there WERE some moments in which they were tolerable. Clary was SO selfish and their romance just resembles Edward's and Bella's from Twilight so much. 
 Jace: I hurt you, I can't be with you anymore now, even though I love 
 you and want to be with you! It's all my fault that you got hurt! (Mind you that I had this annoyance since the start of the series, surprisingly Jace wasn't the culprit in this book though!) 
 Clary: I don't care if you want to die! I love you too much and i'm so selfish that i'm going to make everything worse! I'm going to ignore what everyone tells me to do because I can't lose you; I love you so much that I can't live without you! (Really Clary? *sarcasm* How did you possibly survive before Jace came into your life? Clary was fine throughout the series but recently she's starting to annoy the crap out of me.) 
 I have mixed feelings about how the author wrote about one couple or some group of characters and their adventure and then end the chapter on a cliffhanger. And then the next chapter...SURPRISE! starts right off with a different group of characters...like how she wrote about Simon and Isabelle and then suddenly alternates back to Jace and Clary...Although, at first I was incredibly annoyed, eventually I would warm up and start to get sucked into an adventure only to have the whole process repeat itself. 
 But honestly, Isabelle and Simon...DAWWWW THEY'RE SO CUTE! Favorite couple (are they even an official couple?) from the series!",Thu Jun 07 20:33:06 -0700 2012,Fri Oct 02 17:26:11 -0700 2015,Fri Jun 29 00:00:00 -0700 2012,Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 -0700 2012,0,0

 The prose is gorgeous. 
 The characters oscillate between relatable and too good to be part of this world. It's not so much that I identify with them, as it is that I wish I knew these people (and after reading the book...I feel like I do). 
 My only gripe was with the ending. In a book full of elegant scenarios and understated prose, the drama created in the climax felt out of place. The character's realizations and interactions were briefly overshadowed by the scenario that brought about their development. This didn't last for long though, and wrapped the story up well.

 I wasn't the outlier. I loved it. 
 While there are some plot points and characters that raised eyebrows for me (either for being overly tropey or perhaps not researched well enough) there was so much honesty and love in the crafting of this story that I felt connected to the characters and their struggles through the entire story. The author is able to do this despite basically telling the ending to the story on page one, which is pretty impressive. Definitely a study in creating suspense without withholding unnecessarily.

 This was one of the reads I was most looking forward to for 2016. As such, it's possible I let my own hype build up an impossible standard in my mind. I felt let down by this book, and incredulous at the majority of the plot turns. As a book about the interactions of a group of people dealing with different types of pain, this book is a success. As a book about the interactions of a group of people during a school shooting, this book fails to address the reality of that situation. 
 The writing, especially on a sentence level, is strong. But often it seemed out of character or forced. For example, at one point in a flashback Tyler remarks that Claire is 'great with the underclassmen.' Which sounds not at all like anything else he says and stood out as a decidedly out of character moment. Moments like that forced me to be less in the story, and thus more critical of the interactions. There were multiple times that the characters didn't use contractions or used snippets of Spanish that felt out of place that had the same affect on me: they pulled me out of the story. 
 I love the amount of diversity, but at the same time...it doesn't make sense. Opportunity is supposed to be a small town, with limited emergency staff and hardware stores that are family run and operated. But somehow they attracted a strong group of immigrants? Why would these people move to Opportunity? We're never shown or even have it hinted at as to why Opportunity is so ethnically diverse when for the most part small towns in the south aren't. Though the lack of background might seem small, I think it hints at a larger problem. One where the characters lack in depth. Sure. Not knowing what Tomas and Sylvia's parents do for a living doesn't really impede my understanding of their tragedies, but it does make them feel thin as characters. I wanted to know things like where they did pick up Spanish, were their parents recent immigrants, why did they not get along before, why do they get along now? 
 Despite the apparent abundance of diverse characters, there are a few glaring areas of oversight. At the time of the shooting, the students are in an auditorium. It's plot relevant that no one is outside the auditorium except for a couple of boys in the principal's office. 
 This would never happen. Usually there are a few students with special needs who can't abide the auditorium who are in a pull out classroom, along with special ed teachers and aids. But I guess Opportunity doesn't have a very large special education community? Likewise, the school nurse usually waits in his or her office in the event someone becomes sick, and there are numerous faculty and administration who don't attend events in the auditorium because phones still need to be answered, hallways still have to be monitored, etc. 
 Tyler feels particularly thin as a character. And the added 'rape' felt forced. it felt less like a plot turn and more like ""oh yeah, he's evil. We get it."" It's like watching that little shit Joffrey torture people on Game of Thrones. The first one is important and shocking, but around the fifth I just have to wonder why we have to see all of them. Why does Tyler have to do every evil thing? It would have been more shocking to see Tyler not be evil in some other aspect of his life and yet still be evil. 
 Many of the details surrounding the actual shooting are incorrect, and especially as the novel progressed things seemed increasingly poorly researched. Given the number of shootings in America at this time and thus the number of shooting survivors at this time, that seemed like an egregious fault. it's not hard to find detailed accounts of what it feels like to have a bullet in you. ""pain washed over me"" hardly begins to cover it. Likewise, I felt grossed out by the characters who felt crush-like romantic feelings during the shooting. 
 Overall, this wasn't a bad book. I really can't wait for this writer to write something else. She obviously is talented, but this book doesn't live up to that promise.",Mon Jan 04 05:46:56 -0800 2016,Fri Jan 08 05:24:53 -0800 2016,Fri Jan 08 05:24:53 -0800 2016,Mon Jan 04 00:00:00 -0800 2016,0,0

It is lovely, dense in exactly the right ways, and deals with a lot of emotional situations in ways that are both unique and clever. 
 Obviously, one of these situations is that of losing a friend emotionally and then actually, and how to resolve emotions of hatred and loss simultaneously. When I say it's dealt with uniquely, I mean that Vera is not somehow gifted with an emotional intelligence that would allow her to deal with this nimbly, and instead she simply dumb a**es through in a way that is relatable and cringe inducing.

 Adding in the religion seemed heavy-handed, bogged down the plot with precious pages that could have been better spent exploring Aunt Beast or developing Calvin as a character, and continually pulled me out of the story.

While this book is amazing and delivers both on the promise of a satisfying love story and also on the promise of dealing with OCD...this book is a realistic depiction of OCD, which means that some parts are very difficult to read. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 When Bea meets Beck, you assume that the book is going to deliver a typical love story for us, one where the two characters enter into a relationship and somehow that is going to fix both of their anxiety disorders. 
 That is not how the book flows. Instead, both characters become worse for a good portion of the book. It was a risky choice, but one which Haydu pulls off well by creating real people. I believed in Bea, and as the reasons for her disorder are explored, I truly felt for a character who I wouldn't have expected to. Beck also explores the reasons behind his compulsions. 
 The writing of the anxiety scenes will likely make readers feel uncomfortable. They're explored well, with just enough detail to allow exploration into Bea's mind without feeling lost in it. The million reviews asking/worrying about whether or not Haydu offers a realistic exploration of OCD and anxiety...the answer is yes. She delivers multiple realistic depictions, because anxiety and OCD don't look the same in any two sufferers. Haydu's view is realistic but compassionate. 
 The only reason I battled with giving this book four stars instead of five was because at the end, I didn't understand one character, Austin's, actions at all. But after sleeping on them overnight, I realize that Haydu gave us all of the clues we needed to piece that together, and ultimately shows us a vision of a possible future.

 So, let's get that out of the way. 
 The Golden Compass is one of the most fantastic and compelling starts to any fantasy series ever and OH MY GOD why are you not reading this book RIGHT NOW? 
 In all seriousness, the dialogue between Pullman and Lewis is incredible, and it's hard not to take Pullman's side entirely. Lyra is a remarkable protagonist with who is a perfect blend of flaws and strengths, and her relationship with her daemon, Pan, is so realistic and comforting that every time I stopped reading I kept looking for my own daemon. 
 Pullman blends fantastical elements with mundane ones expertly, and even when we're being taken to lands with talking polar bears, everything is presented so authoritatively that it feels true rather than real. The characters are complicated, the morality is full of greyscale, and none of the decisions are easy, for the characters or for the readers. 
 And that's why it's important. 
 In fantasy, we often rely on good and evil being very black and white concepts, but to actively play with these constructs and show that that's all they are, constructs, is brilliant. In Pullman's world, self-knowledge is king, and the only true evil is to deny your own nature.

 The two narratives are complete on their own, but the intermingling between the two is what makes this such a unique work, and why I consider it a five star book.

I loved the heavy Ronan focus, as Ronan is one of my favorite characters of all time, and this book only solidified that stance. Fantastic character development across the board. This book gives us more insight into all of our favorite raven boys, and Blue. Some reviewers said they felt like there wasn't enough Blue in this story, but I couldn't disagree more. If anything, in this novel I really felt like it was easy to see the way Blue really affects (and improves) the group dynamic. Blue's exchanges with Noah are particularly worth paying attention to if you are Blue fan (who isn't? Great female lead). 
 The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because I felt like there wasn't enough development of the Glendower plot arc, and because, like many middle books in series, it seemed a tad 'mushy' in places. It doesn't have a proper beginning or conclusion on its own. You will be left with more questions than answers, and that's just how middle books are.

 Alina's a complex female character that kicks ass without being TheKickassGirl(tm). A hard line to walk.

 An interesting world with a lot of peripheral moving parts, that encourages me to read the rest of the series.

 -One of the most diverse casts I've seen in a young adult book to date, but due to the sheer number of characters it's difficult for each character to be anything more than a 'point'. 
 -The book's characters were still well constructed given the amount of page space dedicated to each one, and a few of their stories had me in tears because of the accuracy. Bray does address many of the issues facing women in society well, and clearly has a nuanced view of these issues. 
 Overall: This book works well as social commentary (and I agree with its points and think they need to be made), but unfortunately the commentary comes at the expense of plot which feels like a tack on designed to get the characters where they need to be to make the next ""point"".

I liked the world that was created and think it's very different from other dystopian novels out right now. I really like the characters, and feel that most of them were dynamic characters, changing as the events of the novel forced them to. The writing style is simple, easy to read, and very action oriented. 
 The flaws are the ones that most dystopian fantasies struggle with. 
 The characters we 'like' are the ones described as attractive. We're reminded every few pages that Tris is 'slim' and that's what makes her strength so exciting. The ceremony for choosing a faction is too similar to those in other novels (see: Hunger Games, Delirium, etc.).

 I loved this book conceptually from the time it came out, but didn't get a chance to read it until recently. The book centers around the Peter Pan story that we all know and love, but centers around the character of Tiger Lily, and is told from the perspective of Tinkerbell. 
 Pros: 
 The ending of this book is what saved it for me. If I ever have a daughter, I will make sure that she reads this book early and often. Tiger Lily is a strong character, and the ending of the book is much closer to what romantic love is than most of the young adult novels that I read. In the end, you can love someone and not get to have them. I say that, but the novel was also able to avoid becoming preachy. A tough line to walk, and one that I feel earns the author quite a bit of credit in my eyes. 
 Tik Tok's character and relationship with Tiger Lily is also phenomenal. Every exchange between the two of them was emotional and even handed. 
 Cons: 
 Action sequences have a tendency to get muddy and convoluted. 
 Narrating a book about Tiger Lily through the perspective of Tinkerbell gets messy in some places. There are clearly places where the author wanted to include thoughts and feelings, but had to go through the narrator instead, removing us from them by a strange narrative degree. 
 Overall: Would recommend. Especially to actual teenagers. Probably won't read again, but will be on the lookout for other books from this author.",Thu Jun 20 20:05:00 -0700 2013,Sat Jun 29 05:03:45 -0700 2013,Sat Jun 29 05:03:45 -0700 2013,Thu Jun 20 00:00:00 -0700 2013,0,0

The kind of zeal I usually reserve for the last book in a long series whose characters I already know and love and am committed to. That was maybe the most incredible part. 
 The passion and connection I felt for a group of deeply flawed characters, and how quickly I felt it.

 Alec kinda sucked this book. 
 Isabelle got all ""feelings are weird and why do I have them"" 
 Simon continued to wonder ""why am I hanging out with these people?"" 
 And Clary and Jace kept making it perfectly clear that despite all of the super loving friends they have that they would gladly watch the world burn in order to be with each other. I think the best part for me was when Clary kept complaining that Jace wasn't acting like himself, and all I could think was ""a completely hollow, vacant, and attractive shell? No, that sounds about like the Jace the rest of us know and love/hate."" 
 I started skipping the making out scenes just because they were so repetitive. All the time! If Jace and Clary are alone for five seconds? They are making out. I think Cassandra Clare is even sick of writing it. I mean, we've all been young and in love....and somehow I still found time to engage in activities that didn't involve face licking.

 The main characters. 
 Clary and Jace are a little one note. What are they thinking about? Each other. Usually in unbelievably specific detail. What's the first thing everyone else notices about them? How in love with each other they are. What do they talk about? Also...each other. 
 So, why am I still reading this series? 
 Oh my god. The side characters. Simon is a great character by this book. And despite the fact that he has two lovely female characters vying for his attention, a band, etc. he completely avoids being boring or thinking obsessively about girls. Simon's got other things on his mind. Likewise, Isabelle is a strong independent character and I would love to read an entire book about her. The world itself is fairly interesting too, which is part of what drove me nuts about Clary and Jace. ""Oh, I think babies are being murdered...I wonder what Jace is up to, why won't he talk to me?"" 
 Seriously? 
 If you find out something that awful is happening in the world and your first thought is ""why won't my boyfriend call,"" you've got problems.

 This one took me a lot longer to finish than the first two. I really enjoyed the first two books of the series, but this one wasn't as good for me. Out of all of the books this one seemed the most obsessed with the romance between the characters and less on the action, and given how integral this one is to the story arcs, that seems like a serious mistake. 
 Some of my major grievances are that the characters seem to care about their romances above all else. Towards the end of the book Alec is described as looking more relaxed as though a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders. Why? Because he could finally talk about his relationship with his parents. Ignoring the fact that Alec has been a responsible and caring character for the previous two books, I find it strange that this is the most important thing to him by the end of the novel and NOT THE FACT THAT HIS LITTLE BROTHER DIED during the few days he was supposed to be taking care of his younger siblings. 
 Likewise Isabelle, who does have a legitimate emotional reaction to the death of her sibling, is giggling and talking about boys with Maia. 
 Every single character seems to believe that their romantic entanglements are the things that most define them, and seem more interested in figuring out those than in figuring out the world around them. 
 That said, I'll definitely read the next two. Why? Because the action is well written, the world is fascinating, and the characters (when they're not obsessing over who they are going to kiss) are fairly engaging.

 Hate List 
 Author: Jennifer Brown 
 Publisher: Little, Brown books for Young readers 
 Publish Date: September 1st, 2009 
 Pages: 416 
 Five months ago, Valerie Leftman's boyfriend, Nick, opened fire on their school cafeteria. Shot trying to stop him, Valerie inadvertently saved the life of a classmate, but was implicated in the shootings because of the list she helped create. A list of people and things she and Nick hated. The list he used to pick his targets. 
 Now, after a summer of seclusion, Val is forced to confront her guilt as she returns to school to complete her senior year. Haunted by the memory of the boyfriend she still loves and navigating rocky relationships with her family, former friends and the girl whose life she saved, Val must come to grips with the tragedy that took place and her role in it, in order to make amends and move on with her life. 
 Valerie Leftman has an unusual plight. She is both a hero and a villain to the people who made her life a living hell for the past three years. She is a hero for ending the shooting spree that took the lives of several of her classmates and at least one teacher. She's a villain for possibly being the one that started the violence in the first place. 
 Valerie loved Nick so much that she ignored the many warning signs that indicated that something was horribly wrong in his head and instead played into the delusions that united them and eventually led Nick to kill himself after trying to shoot everyone who had ever hurt Valerie. This leaves her to deal with the introspection, and confusion that everyone feels following the shooting. Valerie deals with reporters, her family, and the kids at school, none of whom seem entirely sure of what to think of her anymore, and honestly neither can the reader. It's up to the reader, ultimately, whether Valerie is guilty or not. As many other characters say, she never did shoot anyone, but she did make the outline of who should be. 
 Valerie learns a lot through her last year. Without Nick to shield her or allow her to fall into her own world, Valerie has to live in the real world and her perception grows and expands in order to fit that. 
 Told through both Valerie's own words and the newspaper articles, Hate List is a story about bullying, love, and tolerance. More than that, it's the story of a girl struggling through hurt and loss while all eyes are on her, judging and evaluating her every move. 
 The pacing of Hate List was very good, and while it's a remarkably difficult topic it was handled with the right mix of respect and honesty. The story Jennifer Brown has laid out for us is full of unexpected turns, Valerie's memories of Nick are some of the most beautiful and disturbing chapters. Brown forces us to deal with the reality that Nick wasn't a monster, and that the victims aren't saints through Valerie's eyes. Hate List is probably the first book I have ever read about a school shooting that didn't get thrown across the room, and that's a significant accomplishment. Hate List avoids the realm of preachiness that many other 'issue' books fall into, and instead focuses on telling the story, the true story, of a school on the mend.",Fri Jun 08 07:06:54 -0700 2012,Fri Jun 15 07:08:09 -0700 2012,Fri Jun 15 07:08:09 -0700 2012,Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 -0700 2012,0,0

I absolutely adored all of the characters and I really loved all of the parental relationships presented in this book. Our main character--Ari--reminded me a lot of Charlie from The Perks of Bring a Wallflower, but while there are certainly similarties this story is entirely it's own. I picked this up in audio book because I knew that Lin Manuel Miranda was the narrator and that was pretty much all I needed to know to convince me it was going to be amazing. Lin's narration is perfection (again, no surprises there) and the combination of his voice and the writing style is beautiful. 
 This is a coming of age story, and it is very much character based. It was throughly diverse, centering around two Mexican American families and discovering your sexuality while coming of age. I fell in love with every single character in the story.

The entire book felt like it was all telling and no showing--and the first five chapters or so were just complete info dumps. There was nothing in this book that stood out to me or was particularly interesting in any way. The premise obiously takes place during Christmas, and the main character's family owned a Christmas Tree farm, but overall, this book didn't even put me in the Christmas spirit or have any heartwarming moments. Even the scandal and drama that was supposed to surround the love interest was really dull. I didn't feel like there was ever any actual conflict in this book--everything that happened that could have potentially caused conflict was resolved within chapters in a completely matter of fact way. The dialouge between characters in this book was bland as well, and completley unrealistic. I also felt like the author needed to do a lot more research on several things, and a lot of things that were thrown in were just completely unrealistic. Our main character leaves school from thanksgiving to christmas, and her teachers are just ok with it because they are used to it happening. What about finals? I just cant see that situation ever playing out like that in a real school. Overall there was no development or conflict that I can even think of as I write this review, and it felt like the entire book was a rough draft.",Wed Oct 19 10:31:00 -0700 2016,Sat Dec 17 14:48:11 -0800 2016,Sat Dec 17 14:48:11 -0800 2016,Fri Dec 16 00:00:00 -0800 2016,1,0

I loved the characters in this book and even though I didn't think I was going to be able to see their personality come through with the way this was told, that was not the case at all. This book still managed to be hilarious and sad and beautiful even though it was literally just a compilation of files. It managed to completley take me by suprise and had me on the edge of my seat at multiple times throughout the story--not just at the end.

 I am a sucker for this type of story. Combine NYC with an aspiring writer and throw in hilarious dating escapades and I am so there. When I heard the synopsis for this book I immediately connected it to Sex and the City, The Carrie Diaries, The Devil Wears Prada, and Sophie Kinsella novellas--all things that I LOVE, and I am happy to say that this book did not disappoint my expectations. 
 This book was fun and heartwarming with a healthy dose of second-hand embarrassment at points. It had a great cast of diverse characters and prioritized friendship without making the entire book about dating escapades (although the dating escapades were really fun and hilarious.)

 This book was not what I expected at all. I was so excited to read this book for the plot and while the book in actuality wasn't bad, I had a lot of expectations going into it and there's quite a few things I wish would have happened differently. While this book is definitely a slow building story and you have to have a good amount of patientence before you get to the pay off, I did enjoy reading it and will continue with the sequel. 
 This was definitely a unique book. The story takes place in a matriarchal society where every generation, a set of triplett queens is born, each posessing a different type of magic--the ability to poison, the ability to control elements, or the ability to control animals and nature. Each queen is then sent to live with others of their gift until they turn sixteen years old, when they then fight to the death to determine who will be the one true queen. I was really happy that we got to see from each of the queens perspectives in this book, but I also thought that we got too many different perspectives from side characters. It was overwhelming and confusing at times and I would have prefered it to just have been the three queens. I also went into this thinking that we were actually going to get to see the fight, but majority of the book takes place before they turn sixteen. I thought it made the book a little boring and slower but knowing where the book leaves off and having all of the character and world development discussed in this book, I think the second book has been set up to be pretty amazing.",Sat Oct 08 17:50:35 -0700 2016,Wed Mar 15 10:00:50 -0700 2017,Thu Dec 08 14:21:20 -0800 2016,Sat Dec 03 00:00:00 -0800 2016,1,0

The pacing of this book is a slow burn--it is a lot of world building and character building but it was so fun to follow the characters and learn more about this period in history, which I know virtually nothing about.

The book and her writing completely blew me away. The themes that ran throughout this book were incredible and the way she continued to incorporate them was breathtaking. 
 ""It began with a bang"" 
 The world Schwab has created in this book is now one of my favorite fictional worlds. Set in a futuristic America, the violent crimes people commit have left shadows, and those shadows are turning into monsters. Violent but non-lethal crimes produce Corsai--brutal animalistic monsters. Murders produce Malchai--vampire like bloodsuckers. And mass murders--bombings, terrorist attacks, school shootings--produce the Sunai, the rarest breed of monster that use songs to steal souls. 
 The city of Verity is split into two. The North side is ruled by money, safety can be bought to keep the Corsai and Malchai away. The South side of the city has the Sunai, who only steal the souls of those who have committed the crimes that produce monsters, the crimes that leave shadows that can think for themselves 
 Our story follows two main characters. Kate Harker, daughter of the head of the North side of the city, who is fighting her way back to her father, to prove that she has what it takes to live among the monsters. And August Flynn, Sunai, who wants more than anything else to human. 
 This book had great characters (especially August who needs to be protected at all costs), beautiful writing, and amazing story building and plot. I am very interested to see how the follow-up, Our Dark Duet, stands in comparison to this book, as it is set to pick up six months after the events of this book leave off. This is surprising to me because as far as I know this is only a duology and I was expecting this book to leave on a cliff hanger with a clear view of the problem the second book would have to solve. However, this book wrapped up fairly well so I'm curious to see how she approaches the next book. Now I just have to eagerly await the book two and definitely need to check out more of Schwab's work in the future.",Sun Aug 07 07:28:52 -0700 2016,Fri Sep 08 12:03:38 -0700 2017,Tue Oct 25 15:02:49 -0700 2016,Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 -0700 2016,1,0

 Even though this book is clearly a retelling about the Queen of Hearts from Alice and Wonderland, I'm a little shell shocked by the ending of this book. I will say that I read the original Alice's Adventures In WonderLand and Through the Looking Glass in preparation for this book, and oh my goodness that was the best decesion I could have ever made. If I thought I was impressed by Meyer's ability to craft retellings when I read the Lunar Chronicles, that was truly nothing after reading this book. The amount of references to the original text and the way she crafts this story to make sense with the originals is absoultly amazing.

 This book had so many cute and fun components. I especially loved all of the group chats and all of the interactions between her group of friends, and I absolutely adored Clark. I also loved seeing her relationship with her Dad grow, even though there were some pretty embarrassing scenes there for awhile that were making me cringe with second-hand embarrassment. I felt like Andie had fantastic character development and I liked the way all of the issues she struggled with came together at the end of the book. 
 The ending came together in typical Morgan Matson fashion-- so much started happening in the last thirty pages that I had no idea how everything would come together and wrap up in time. But even though there wasn't a perfect fairy-tale ending, I feel like it ended on a better note than Since You've Been Gone, and it left me feeling more satisfied.

I'm glad I finally got to experience what all of the hype around Colleen Hoover is about because I thought this was really fantastic. The writing was great and the characters were really well fleshed out and likeable. I really really liked the whole premise of this one and where the book went. There was a lot going on and I was happy that I wasn't able to guess any of the plot twists so I was really along for the ride with the characters. I also loved that one of the characters was a reader and the other was a writer because it made the book really self-aware in a cool way. 
 However, I really wanted to be able to give this book five stars, but there was one major thing holding me back. I really didn't like how this book blurred the lines of consent at all. I just found myself really struggling to read some parts because they were making me physically uncomfortable. There was one scene, for example, when Fallon tells Ben to stop kissing her and he says something along the lines of ""I'm trying but I'm having a hard time, ask me again."" No means no, and that was the one thing I really didn't like about Ben. I know he was trying to get Fallon out of her comfort zone and while he may have had good intentions for me it just isn't ever justifiable or ok.

 I was so excited for this book and from the moment I opened it I knew it wouldn't dissapoint me. Nicola Yoon has a way of telling stories that is incredibly beautiful and completely original and leaves you sitting in awe for hours after you've finished it. 
 In The Sun Is Also A Star, we get two main characters: Natasha, a Jamaican girl who is hours away from being deported, and Daniel, a Korean boy who is struggling to live up to his parents expectations. This book is beautifully diverse and tackles important issues with with deft and grace. 
 My favorite part of this book was the way that it was written. Not only to you get to bounce between Daniel, a poet who is obsessed with love, and Natash, a scientist that doesnt even believe in it-- but we get background stories for character's we meet in passing, histories of people and events, and scientific explanations of abstract concepts. The way Yoon manages to weave all of the parts of this story together is magical. Not to mention her prose is pure poetry. 
 I did have a couple small problems with this book. For whatever reason, I found some parts in the middle dragged a bit, and it was hard for me to push through. I think it may be the fact that I'm not a huge fan of stories that are told in the span of one day. Things move too fast for me and I have a hard time suspending my disbelief that so much could happen and characters could go through so much development in such little time. That being said, I did find Daniel kind of intense and overbearing at some points, because he was so gung ho for love in such a short amount of time. However, this book also did a really good job of addressing that and being really self aware, so it was only a very minor issue, which is why I rounded up to five stars. 
 If you have not read anything by Nicola Yoon yet I would highly recommend her work. I found Everything Everything to be more entertaining (I literally read it in one sitting) but I think that this book is overall more well written and the concepts in it are more engaging. Either way, they are both worth reading!",Thu Apr 14 11:15:33 -0700 2016,Mon Nov 07 21:51:04 -0800 2016,Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 -0800 2016,Sat Nov 05 00:00:00 -0700 2016,0,0

 There were a lot of things I liked about this book. I think the strongest element for me was the characters. They were all very real and very individually well developed. The only one that grated on me at times was Vivi. Obviously there were completely legitimate reasons for her acting the way she did, it was just still hard to read at parts. 
 One thing I really liked was that Lord is amazing with her descriptions. I felt like I had such a vivid mental image of what everything and everyone looked like in a very realistic way.

When I picked up this book, the last thing I thought I'd be when reading it was bored, but that's exactly what I was from almost start to finish. The one good thing about this book that I really really liked the amount of diversity the characters had, and at first it made me really hopeful for the story. The problem was, while I liked the fact that the characters were diverse, I didn't actually like the characters. I didn't hate them, I just didn't really care about them or feel any attachment to them what so ever. I think the main problem with this book is that there are WAY too many subplots. The author tries to cram every relevant issue today into this book. While a school shooting is going on, characters are also dealing with abuse, rape, and other family issues. There's too much going on for you to care about all of it or for it to feel like the characters care about all of it, so instead you care about none of it. I was also hopeful because I had heard that the author did a lot of research before writing this, so I expected it to be very accurate to real events, but based only off of my first-hand experience in the public school system, I could tell that it wasn't. It might have been a realistic portrayal of something that would happen 10 years ago, but not now, after our country has experienced events like this time and time again. My biggest problem was when the shots first started and the coach outside had no idea what to do. Teachers have lock down procedure drilled into them and they would always have some procedure for kids to follow in any situation. I also thought that the social media sections were a huge disappointment. It could have been done so well but it all felt so fake and nothing like what actual teenagers would write on twitter. I just think this book should have been gone about in an entirely different way, and overall it left me feeling disappointed and underwhelmed.",Sat Mar 19 13:06:19 -0700 2016,Fri Apr 15 09:14:21 -0700 2016,Fri Apr 15 09:14:21 -0700 2016,Thu Apr 14 00:00:00 -0700 2016,0,0

 I have to say that I found myself skimming a lot of this book. I just could not get into it. I missed not having our cast of characters around that I had grown to love so much in Hollow City, because they really make the story for me. Emma and Jacob on their own were pretty boring to read about. I also felt like the pacing was super off--the first half didn't really have anything happening and by the time the action started picking up I was disinterested and it was really hard for me to get back into the story.

I had seen the movie before reading the book, and because it's a pretty faithful adaption I felt myself skimming the first book and waiting for it to end. I wasn't sure if it was becuase I already knew the information or if it was the writing itself, but I adored this second installment, so my doubts have been vanished. 
 The second book picks up right where we left off in the first. I was really hoping that we would get to explore more loops in this book because that concept is so interesting to me and I was not disspointed. Ransom Riggs continued to use vintage photographs to further this story and take it to interesting and original places. Reading these books is a lot like reading Harry Potter for me. I love all of the children so much and I love the innocence that they bring to the story as they naviagte these pecular places and people while facing dangers that ordinary children would be unable to face.

 It was such a disappointment for me because I loved the first book so much, but this was a major second book slump. I love the characters and the world, but I just could not find it in me to care about the plot in this installment. I really really wanted to, there was just nothing for me to latch onto.

 I absolutely loved this collection of novellas. I thought they were extremely well written and I thought each one was equally captivating in its own way, but they all built off of each other to tell one story. 
 The hardest part of reading Heir of Fire for me was seeing Celaena so broken and depressed. I loved reading these novellas because we got to see more of the old fiery, sarcastic Celaena, who I love reading about. It was so hard getting to know Sam because I shipped him and Celaena so much even though I knew it wasn't going to end well. I'm really glad I read these before starting Queen of Shadows because I learned a lot about Arobynn and what an ass he is, and he is going to be an important part of Queen of Shadows, so now I am really looking forward to that confrontation and for Celaena to (hopefully) get her revenge.",Fri Feb 26 18:43:32 -0800 2016,Mon Aug 07 08:54:28 -0700 2017,Wed Mar 30 00:00:00 -0700 2016,Sun Mar 27 00:00:00 -0700 2016,0,0

It was equal parts creepy, funny, and romantic. The only problem I had with the book that knocked it a star was the fact that there would be times when reading where I felt that certain events were really choppy and didn't flow in a way that made sense, or Mara reacted to something in a way that I didn't understand or wasn't believable.

I actually ended up seeing the movie before reading the book, and I really, really loved the movie. My feelings toward the book are more lukewarm. A lot of this book is worldbuilding and being introduced to all of the characters, and the movie did a really good job of sticking to the book for the most part, so it was a lot of reading things that I already knew, and I think that it made it a little boring for me. I also found myself not liking certain characters while reading as much as I liked them in the movie. However, I could have had a completely different reaction had I read the book first, so that's why I feel like I can't be completely fair in this review.

And I did enjoy this book and I think this series is going promising places, but there are definitely some obvious ways that Bardugo's writing has improved from this book to now. 
 My biggest problem with this book was that I felt like it was all telling and no showing. I love the world of Grisha and I thought this book had a really good plot, but there would be whole paragraphs that would literally just describe big chunks of time and events that happened, instead of showing us those events. It was a lot of narrations where I felt like she could have made more scenes and dialogue. I feel like this also led me to not care about the characters as much because they didn't have enough interactions that we got to see, and when I don't care about the characters, I'm just not that interested in the story. 
 I also think that maybe I could have enjoyed this more if I had read it before Six of Crows. Since I was already acquainted with the whole Grisha magic system--which I loved reading about in Six of Crows-- I feel like it took some of the novelty of the discovery of the world that happens in the first book in a series.

I thought it was way too rushed and we didn't get closure with as many characters as I would have liked without there being a sequel. But I really did love this book! I thought the character development was amazing and all the characters were portrayed as very realistic. I loved the plot and the list and all of the different friendship dynamics in this book as well. I'm also really happy that the whole Sloane mystery was actually solved in the end because I was worried we would never get to know what really happened, so I liked that aspect of the ending. I read Amy and Roger's Epic Detour last summer and I thought it was a fun read, but I definitely enjoyed this one a lot more.

 UUUGGHHHHHHH. Commence prolonged mourning period. After reading this book I definitely realized I will have to go back at some point and reread this series because I ended up missing a lot in my haste to get to the end and find out what happens. I thought this book had a great amount of action for a second book and it had its own plot that I really really enjoyed--no second book syndrome at all! Can I just say that I felt really bad for Mare during this book? I felt like everyone was being so unfair and cruel to her. Throughout the book I really empathized with her and I didn't think that anything she did was as bad as anyone made it out to be? She was a little power hungry but I felt that after everything she went through in book one she had a right to want to feel powerful and in control of her life. And yeah, she didn't trust anyone but if I went through what she went through, I wouldn't either! I honestly hated Farley at the end of this book I couldn't believe she would act that way to Mare when it was her own brother who died. When Shade died I felt a knife go through my back as well. I had to pause and take deep breaths. He was the only person besides Mare that I trusted throughout this entire book, so of course he had to die. I was living for the sweet moments between Mare and Cal, they made me so happy. I just wished there would have been a lot more of them! This series is super light on romance, to the point that we don't even get any makeout scenes between the characters, only quick kisses and thigh rubbing, which is great, but I need more. I guess it's probably a lot more realistic given that they're in a life or death situation and that's probably the last thing they're thinking about, but come on, we don't read these types of books because they're realistic. When I read Red Queen, I had a gut feeling that Maven was going to betray her, so that book didn't have as big of a plot twist for me, but I completely did not see this ending coming. It seemed so plausible that they would to the war for the last book I could see it playing out in my head already so I was SHOCKED. I have no idea now how the next book will play out at all but desperately need it in my life.",Mon Feb 15 09:57:17 -0800 2016,Fri Apr 01 14:14:30 -0700 2016,Sat Feb 27 00:00:00 -0800 2016,Wed Feb 24 00:00:00 -0800 2016,1,0

I do think that it has to do more with personal taste than anything else, because I really like Sarah J Maas and the Throne of Glass series. I will say that this book was really close to being 3 stars, but I couldn't do it because I came so close to DNFing this book many different times. The whole first half of this book just dragged on and on to me. I didn't really feel like there was anything particularly likeable about the main character or the love interest, so that aspect didn't hook me into the story either. However, I was never a fan of the actual story of beauty and the beast to begin with, so that is why I blaming most of my dissatisfaction on taste more than anything else. I did find the character of Rhysand very interesting and was more into the story by the end, which is why I think I will continue on with the series eventually and I am very hopeful that I will like the second book more.

All of the characters and their emotions and their decisions made them feel like real people to me. The dialogue especially was some of the most realistic-sounding dialogue I've ever read in a contemporary. I fell so deeply in love with Adam's song lyrics at the beginnings of the chapters it took my breath away. I want them to be real songs so badly!

 In my original review below, I did not like Passenger as much as I was hoping to. I enjoyed a lot of aspects about the book, but it didn't hold my attention, and I felt like I had maybe read it at the wrong time. Recently with the release of Wayfarer I was feeling nostalgic for this story and I decided to give it another go. This time around, I throughly enjoyed it. I was able to fully engross myself in the story this time and parts that I found confusing before I now understood because I remembered it from the first read through. This is one of the things that I love most about reading and stories in general. They mean different things to everyone who reads them, and are so influenced by where we are in reality while we are reading them. I love that I can come back to a story a year later and take away completely different things than I did before.

 This is a difficult review for me to write because I'm not sure why I didn't particularly love the book. I thought the writing was great, and I really enjoyed the diversity in the book and the places they traveled to were very intriguing to me. I thought that the first 100 pages or so could have been trimmed down significantly. It was very hard to follow what was going on in the beginning and I think that it was mostly because of the dual POV. I could follow Etta's chapters but I thought Nicholas's were unnecessary and confusing because they focused only on past information we knew nothing about, and I think we could have just been presented with that information later when we had a better understanding of what was going on. Once they started traveling I became more excited but for some reason, I still just couldn't get into it. I think it may just be a personal preference, because so many people have raved about this book. There was nothing necessarily wrong with it I just personally found it a bit boring.",Tue Jan 19 16:04:46 -0800 2016,Sun Jan 08 10:27:49 -0800 2017,Sun Jan 08 13:58:41 -0800 2017,Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 -0800 2017,3,0

I think that overall the writing and content of this book is more mature. It was definitely darker as well. It was done really well for a stand-alone fantasy novel. Usually when I read stand-alone fantasy's I feel like there's not enough world building or character building but I didn't feel that with this book at all. The only thing I think could have been done better was developing the romance in the book. The main character actually spent very little time with the love interest in this book, and most of the book was devoted to her and her relationships with the other Siren's and the ocean. I liked the other Sirens, I just felt like all of those plot points weren't really what the main idea of the book was about, and so it kind of felt like needless information, and she barely ended up spending any time with the guy she was in love with.

There were so many times while reading it that I found myself just completely unable to get over how unique and cool this world is. It's also my new favorite fairy tale retelling of all time. A lot of retellings are very loosely based, but I loved how many aspects of the original Cinderella there were in this book and how they all came together in new and original ways. I loved Cinder's character so much and even though I could kind of see some of the plot twists coming I still really enjoyed reading them. That ending though.

Red Queen has a lot of hype and I felt like the writing in the beginning was very basic and the characters and the story line were kind of flat and boring. THAT BEING SAID, this book gets exponentially better as it progresses--writing, character and plot wise. If you aren't completely loving the book during the first 100 pages, KEEP READING. A lot of what I thought was ""bad writing"" ended up being the foundation for plot twists that I mistook for plot holes at the time. I trusted characters that I knew I shouldn't have trusted, and when their betrayal came, it still broke my heart. For the last 100 pages of this book, I was completely immersed and could not put the book down. Mare Barrow is a complete badass and I love her for it.

I think this book had to have made the biggest, most satisfying comeback in book history. I read the second half almost in one sitting, and when I had to stop reading to go to class, I couldn't stop thinking about when I could race home to finish it. Most people that have read and enjoyed Vampire Academy and Bloodlines will tell you that the series only gets better after the first book--and I completely agree. I think that aspect of Mead's writing style is reflected in this book as well. The Glittering Court is technically a ""series"", but in reality, it's the same story being told three times from different perspectives, so the book actually reads as a stand alone. I think that's why I found the first half so boring. A lot needed to be set up so that the second half could wrap itself up, and once the foundations were laid and the character relationships were built, the book was AMAZING. However, a lot of aspects about the first half did annoy me. Adelaide and Tamsin could both be very pretentious and annoying at times, and a lot of ""issues"" they faced--like what colors they were dressed in or the decorations for events-- I didn't really care about. But by the second half of the book, Adelaide felt like a completely different character, and I loved her, so it ended up being great character development on Mead's part. I am excited to read the other two books and learn more about the other characters, but I really, really wish this series would have just followed Adelaide and Cedric's story because I ended up loving them so much by the end of the story and I feel like if their story continued I probably would've ended up loving it as much as bloodlines.",Wed Dec 23 10:09:12 -0800 2015,Wed Mar 15 10:04:01 -0700 2017,Wed Apr 13 14:57:19 -0700 2016,Sun Apr 10 00:00:00 -0700 2016,0,0

I think that the quality of these short stories surpasses the collection in My True Love Gave To me, and I was so happy to discover that as a whole this book is incredibly diverse (in every definition of the word) 
 Head, Scales, Tongue, Tail; Leigh Bardugo: 5 Stars- A great start to the anthology. Absolutely stunningly beautiful writing. 
 The End of Love; Nina Lacour: 4 Stars- Very cute with very likable, realistic characters. 
 Last Stand at the Cinegore; Libba Bray: 5 Stars- This one was epic. Hilarious dialogue and amazing characters. 
 Sick Pleasure; Francesca Lia Block: 3 Stars- This was the only one that didn't quite work for me. I found it kind of strange and hard to get through because of the character names, but at the end it kind of made sense because I gathered that this was somewhat based on a true story (?) 
 In Ninety Minutes Turn North; Stephanie Perkins: 5 Stars- I loved that this one was a continuation. Stephanie Perkins never disappoints. 
 Souvenirs; Tim Federle: 4 Stars- Very cute with well-written characters. I really liked the themes brought up in this one. 
 Inertia; Veronica Roth: 5 Stars- Such a cool concept that was well-written and beautifully sad. The underlying issues regarding mental health were so heartbreaking but also so important to write about. 
 Love is the Last Resort; Jon Skovron: 4 Stars- I started out LOVING this one, and it gave me a very Jane the Virgin feel with the narration. I loved the setting and the characters, but as the story went on the dialogue really got on my nerves--it was super unrealistic. 
 Good Luck and Farewell; Brandy Colbert: 5 Stars- This one made me cry. Maybe it's because I'm from Chicago, and the contents of this story felt all the more real to me, but this story was just beautiful. Absolute perfection. 
 Brand New Attraction; Cassandra Clare: 5 Stars- This was my most anticipated story of the collection, and it did not disappoint! It was so awesome to see Cassandra Clare's amazing writing in a setting that was different than her shadowhunter novels. 
 A Thousand Ways This Could All Go Wrong; Jennifer E. Smith: 4 Stars- This story was very cute while also managing to deal with a very important yet rarely talked about subject matter, and I loved that. 
 The Map of Tiny Perfect Things; Lev Grossman: 5 Stars- The perfect bookend to wrap up this anthology. This story made me think so deeply. Amazingly written.",Wed Dec 23 08:12:23 -0800 2015,Sun May 29 20:56:39 -0700 2016,Sun May 29 00:00:00 -0700 2016,Wed May 25 00:00:00 -0700 2016,4,0

That being said, this is definitely a book that demands your full undivided attention, because there is so much going on and a lot of world building that you really have to pick up on yourself as you read. I was absolutely in love with every single one of the characters and I thought it was genius how all of their backstory was woven through with the plot of the book, because the backstory was a huge part of the story, and super, super interesting.

I went into this book sceptical about the plot, but I had good faith because it had so many positive reviews. I ended up getting let down by expectations that were not that high to begin with. 
 This story is told in an alternate reality in which the Axis powers are not defeated in WWII. Our main character, Yael, is a Jewish concentration camp survivor. As a child in these camps, she became part of the eugenics experiements the Nazi's conducted. As an unforseen side effect of these experiements, Yael gains the abillity to change her appearance at will. The story alternates between Yael's past story in the camp and Yael's current mission: to win a deadly motorcycle race and kill Hitler. 
 I'll start by saying that I loved the timeline set in the past. I found the premise of her gaining her ability fascinating and the stories of the people she left behind heartbreaking. When I was reading these chapters I could not put the book down. 
 However, I wish she would have executed the current time-line very differently. Part of the reason I was skeptical about this book was I found the premise of a motorcycle race with the reward of a ball in your honor thrown by Hitler very cheesey. I wanted to give it a try and I hoped that it would prove me wrong, but I was not able to get into it at all. I just felt that these parts were written so flatly, and I was completley bored while reading them. I couldn't get into any of the characters at all, which is interesting to me because I was able to do so in the chapters told in flashbacks. 
 Apart from being just a generally flat character, I was constanly frustrated by the choices that Yael would make. She was supposed to be trained to be the best chance the rebellion had at killing Hitler, yet every mistake she made was so stupid and easliy aviodable, and then she would still be surprised when she was caught or challenged.

It had an overall happy ending but with enough loss and heartbreaking moments to make it believable. Beautifully written as always (I think that's to be expected from any of Oliver's books). The only thing that I wished would've been done differently is that the ending felt very rushed to me. I felt like majority of the book could've been sped up to give her more time to drag out the ending and make it more detailed and give us more or an epilogue, or she could've just made the book longer to wrap it up a little bit more.

I started out absolutely loving this book and every single character, but as I read more and more, I think I liked it less and less? I'm not sure if that's really how I feel or if it was just a lot of reading in a short amount of time, but I didn't finish this book feeling like I usually do after finishing a Cassandra Clare book. At first I loved every single character so much, but (super unpopular opinion) I don't like Mark at all. I completely sympathize with what he's gone through and I feel bad for the guy, but he made me so angry and reading from his POV was so boring and made me madder. As I read, I decided I just really really loved Julien and he DOES NOT get enough recognition and love and people give him such a hard time for the dumbest reasons and I will defend him until I die. I liked that in this book our main character was a Shadowhunter already so we didn't have to go through the whole explanation and discovery of the shadow world again because it would have been so repetitive for me at this point. However, I think the main reason I wasn't as captivated with this book was because I didn't like the plot line and the villain as much as I like the plot lines in her other novels. I thought it was very interesting, but it moved way too slowly to the point where I was really just reading for the character relationships and not the plot at all. I couldn't believe that the mystery of Emma's parents deaths was solved in book one! That just felt so anticlimactic and simple to me considering that is the conflict our main character starts the story with.

Much like the first three books, The Heir was a simple and fluffy read, but one that was still very entertaining. 
 I know a lot of people dislike this book because of the main character but I honestly really liked her. I found her flawed but still very relatable. She definitely has her problems but I think in YA we get a lot of these seemingly perfect female protagonists and I think it was really nice and refreshing to see a protagonist who is flawed but still has the potential to go through a lot of character growth. I also think that a lot of aspects of her personality make complete sense considering her background. 
 I liked getting a different perspective of the selection in this book as well. Getting to know all of the boys made this a really fun read for me. At this point, I have no idea who she will choose to be with in the end (if anyone) and I like that about this book as well.

I thought I had so much more time with these characters! They'll still be in The Heir obviously but it won't be the same. 
 The one thing that really shocked me about this book was the amount of character death! The first two books didn't have any deaths at all so I definitely fell into a false sense of security there! I'm really glad Cass ended up putting the deaths in though because some of the problems I had with the first two books were that they were too fluffy. I never felt like the characters were in any real danger, and I think it made the plot and the causes the characters fought for a lot more valid! I was also really happy with the way the romances ended up as well. I won't give anything away, but there were no loose ends there. My favorite part about the book was the way the girls all ended up coming together and working out their differences. I loved how they were able to end the drama and have each others backs.

I was a bit worried as to how everything would wrap up in an entertaining way because this book was so short but there were some great twists that I didn't expect.

 I was determined to give this book 4 starts up until the very end. But I love this series and the ending too much to do it (even though it's probably 4.5 stars in my opinion). 
 I just struggled so hard with the beginning of this book. I'll admit, I had very high expectations because The Wrath and The Dawn was literal perfection, but I just found the first half of this book so . . . boring. Renee Ahdieh will also hold the award for most beautiful writing ever, but the beginning of this book was so dragged out and oversimplified to me. I felt like ultimately the characters overcame every obstacle in this book way too easily. Artan told Shazi that his aunt would eat her alive, and when they went to visit her, everything was fine. I expected her to at least trick or lie to them, but no. I even half expected the Magus to betray them because everything at that point seemed suspiciously easy to me. Shazi's magic lessons in the middle of the book seemed overall pointless to me as well. Nothing ever really came of it because I still think in the end Shazi could have come to the conclusion with the chains on her own like she did with the carpet. All that these scenes really added to the book was length. And then they needed to destroy the book, and they did. Even Shazi's escape from Salim seemed relatively easy. 
 Also Tariq PISSED ME OFF TO NO END.

It might just be me-- I don't know if I've ever read a stand-alone dystopian book that I really got into. I prefer the character growth over the span of a series.

I could feel myself slipping into a reading slump and I'm so thankful I picked this book up when I did because it managed to engage me like no other book I've read in a seriously long time. The best thing about this book is that it's so completely unique and different than anything I've ever read. Usually, I'm always drawing connections in my mind between books while I'm reading but this book really created a world of its own. I had absolutely no idea where the plot was headed or how things would resolve and I didn't see any of the plot twists coming, which is really rare for me because I've found that lately I usually always can tell where books are headed and see the plot twists coming before the main character.

His word choice and sentence structure are absolutely breathtaking. I think that's the one thing that really makes these books stand out to me. Instead of just writing a book about fighting aliens, Yancy has created a book that questions the essence of humanity and the meaning of hope. That's definitely what I like the most about these books. 
 The only thing I do not like is that sometimes the writing is so poetic and beautiful that the action can be hard to follow. There were times when I would be reading and I would have to double back and carefully reread something I had missed to find out what was going on, because of the writing style, and even now I'm a little unclear on some things. The other problem I had with this book specifically is that it took a REALLY long time to get into the action. I did really enjoy the book, especially the second half. 
 I love the authenticity of Yancey's characters. Even though the book takes place in a post-apocalyptic environment, I still feel like the characters all act like people I could meet in real life. There's nothing worse than reading a young adult book where the characters don't act like teenagers would actually act, but Yancey hits the nail right on the head.",Sun Nov 29 18:27:16 -0800 2015,Sat Mar 26 14:19:25 -0700 2016,Wed Feb 03 00:00:00 -0800 2016,Sat Jan 30 00:00:00 -0800 2016,1,0

Everything about this story was absolutely brilliant. I loved the fact that this story was told in four different perspectives, and the way she opened with each story connecting was amazing. I loved it because she chose to have each character come from a different country, and therefore tell a different part of the complex story that is World War II. The thing I love most about Sepetys as a historical fiction writer is that she always tells the stories that aren't well known. As an American, I grew up learning that the Germans were bad and the Soviets invaded and saved the Jews and liberated everyone. While Germany obviously played an awful part in the war, the Soviets were just as bad, and Sepetys brings this to light. It was so interesting that the characters were actually seeking refuge in Germany. The writing in the book was so beautiful and it brought me to tears quite a few times. I loved the connection to Between Shades of Gray as well! This book I think was more graphic in nature than Between Shades of Gray, but I think that it needed to be in order to tell the important but forgotten story of all of the people that lost their lives in this part of the war.

I was really enthralled with the first half of the book and couldn't put it down, but the second half lost my interest a bit.

It wasn't perfect, but I did overall really enjoy it! I was pleasantly surprised in the fact that for a male writer, Yancey writes in the female perspective very well--and he writes some pretty kick ass female characters, so if you appreciate that as much as I do, check this book out. The only thing I didn't like about it was the fact that a lot of the characters were so emotionally detached. None of the feelings seemed genuine, and the characters barely mourned at all over the deaths of their loved ones.

I loved getting to see a different perspective on Every Day, since it was one of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read. While this book wasn't quite as perfect as the original (and I never expected it to be), Rhiannon's POV still proved to be insightful and was written with the same literary excellence.

 I'm about to rant a bit in this review because I feel like hate on this book for the wrong reasons. Here's the thing about this book, and about young adult books in general. This book was definitely intended for younger audiences on the young adult spectrum. The writing is very simple, and conflict gets resolved very quickly in the book. But that is not necessarily a bad thing, nor does it make this a bad book. Young adult is a very broad genre. You are going to have young adult writers that write with a wide vocabulary and include more graphic themes in their books, and you will also get books with more basic themes and simpler vocabulary, AND BOTH ARE EQUALLY NEEDED IN THE GENRE. Not all teenagers read at the same Lexile level, and that is a very important thing to understand. 
 As for the story itself, I loved it. I thought it was very fun and super funny, I laughed out loud several times. The only problem I had with it was that the dialogue could be very unnatural and cringe-worthy at times. Overall I do think it was a good book, and even though I could see most of the plot coming, it didn't make me enjoy it any less. Zoe set out to create a positive message with diverse teens struggling with real life issues, and she got it exactly right. 
 Was it a personal favorite of mine? Probably not, but I can also take a step back and realize that as a nineteen-year-old, I am not this book's target audience. This book is written for much younger readers going through these struggles and reading about characters like them for the first time, and as a publishing major, I can say that even though this book is not tailored to suit my preferences as a reader, it is a great asset to the young adult world and other readers.",Thu Oct 22 14:23:50 -0700 2015,Wed Mar 15 10:04:34 -0700 2017,Fri Mar 18 14:04:52 -0700 2016,Wed Mar 16 00:00:00 -0700 2016,0,0

It was ok, but I couldn't really get as into it as I wanted to. The thing I've discovered about Marie Lu is that, for me, when she writes a series, I like each book better than the last. That was how it was for me when I read the Legend series and I can tell that's how it's going to be for this series as well. I think my problem with The Young Elites was that I spent a majority of the book really confused and trying to take in everything about the world and reading this book, I had a better grip on all of that. 
 The Rose Society is extremely dark--but that can only be expected since it is a villain origin story. I really found myself falling in love with the characters in this book and becoming way more attached to them. The first half of this book was kind of hard to get into for me but the second half completely made up for it--it was fantastic! I'm so excited for the last book to come out and I have a feeling it's going to be my favorite out of the three, like how Champion ended up being my favorite Legend book.

The story is told with a mix of prose, poetry, drawings, IMs, and lists. I've never read another book quite like this one. There were lines that completely blew me away and left me breathless upon finishing. I can't believe this is a debut novel. I almost finished this in one day because I couldn't put it down. The only thing I would change is that I desperately wish it was longer. The book is just barely 300 pages and it could easily be 100 more.

 Every Day follows the story of A, a teenager who wakes up every day in a different body, a different life. A has no gender, no sexual preference, A just is. Following A's story allows you to experience so many different lives and personalities on an incredibly intimate and raw level. 
 A goes through life trying as hard as possible to play along with the life of whoever's body they are inhabiting for the day. It isn't until A meets Rianhhon that everything changes, and A is left desperately wishing for a life they never had, a life that's permanent, that can hold the possibility of forever. 
 Every Day is written in beautiful prose that creates a unique rhythm as you read and immerses you in the story.

 About a year ago I was able to hear Katherine Howe speak at a YA literature festival, and it was clear that her books were very research based, and she clearly knew her stuff. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to follow or get into the events in the book if they were written overly analytical, but that was not the case at all. This book managed to blend historical accounts with a great modern day voice that had me completely pulled in and immersed by the first chapter. 
 ""Sometimes, Colleen, it can be hard to tell, in history. There's the dominant narrative. And there are the parts of the story that are overlooked. Maybe because they don't fit with what they people in charge have to say. Sometimes, the people in charge, all come to one explanation, and once that happens, they will do whatever they can cling to it. They've staked their reputations on it being right. Maybe the experts have their own agenda. Maybe that's true for one group of people isn't necessarily true if looked at from another group's point of view."" 
 This novel has two alternate storylines. The main story follows Coleen, a high school senior starting her spring semester at a competitive private girls school that puts students on track for an ivy league education. One by one girls in the senior class begin to fall victim to a mysterious illness. Each girl has a different set of symptoms--symptoms very similar to the one's reported in Salem in 1706. Howe writes this story in a tone that feels as though someone is recounting events to you aloud. It is refreshing and completely immersive. Although I found some parts of the story obvious, I thoroughly enjoyed reading every part of it and was shocked by some twists I did not see coming. 
 The story is interjected with interludes, where we follow Ann and the events that led to the Salem witch hunts. I found this narrative a bit confusing, and I blame that on my complete lack of knowledge on the Salem witch hunts and that part of history. Since it is told in first person, you don't get a lot of backstory on why things happen or the way that they happen. At first, I found this narrative boring and would skim to get back to the main story, but eventually this storyline gripped me as well. 
 I'm glad that I was able to put my original hesitations aside and give this book a chance, and it actually taught me a lot of interesting things about the Salem witch hunts. I had so much fun reading and trying to piece together the puzzle and figure out what was going on. It was definitely an original book unlike any YA I'd read before, and that made it a very refreshing read.",Sun Oct 11 10:34:30 -0700 2015,Sat Oct 29 21:28:07 -0700 2016,Sat Oct 29 00:00:00 -0700 2016,Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 -0700 2016,0,0

It was very well written, and I did overall like the book, but it was incredibly hard for me to get into, so it took me much longer to read than usual, and I kept putting it down to read other books. 
 This book is told in dual POV's between twins Noah and Jude, and also dual time lines--Noah's story taking place when they were 13 years old, and Jude's taking place when they are 16 years old. I've read plenty of books with multiple POV's before, and plenty of books that have flashbacks in time. What didn't work for me about this book was that it incorporated both. At the beginning, I felt like everything I read in Noah's story was pointless because I knew how everything had turned out from reading Jude's story. I definitely think that the flashbacks were an important part of the plot in this book, I just think that aligning them only with his character made his story seem pointless. I think I would have overall enjoyed the stories more if they were two separate books. 
 Overall I thought the writing was really beautiful and it was so fascinating to read from the point of view of artists, and Jandy Nelson did a really good job writing that POV. I thought the character development was really really excellent. The family dynamics were spot on and I ended up liking characters that I never thought I could like at the end of the book.",Sun Oct 11 09:59:35 -0700 2015,Mon Jun 13 07:38:21 -0700 2016,Mon Jun 13 08:02:12 -0700 2016,Tue May 31 00:00:00 -0700 2016,2,0

 The reason I liked this retelling so much was because of the fact that Meyer was actively writing it to break gender roles, which are what bothered me the most about the original Twilight books. 
 Life and Death tells the exact same story as the original Twilight, but with a completely genderswapped set of characters. This creates an interesting plot that is extremely unusual for any young adult book today: a male character is constantly being saved from female characters, by female characters. I liked that about the book. I also liked the way the male Bella viewed the female Edward. He was never embarrassed or intimidated by her obviously superior strength. 
 The problems of two teenagers falling in love way too fast are still there, but Meyer didn't set out to change the story, just the characters, and overall I liked the direction she took.",Tue Oct 06 14:16:36 -0700 2015,Tue Mar 07 09:52:48 -0800 2017,Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 -0700 2015,Tue Oct 13 00:00:00 -0700 2015,2,0

I was hoping that it would be a New Vampire Academy or Mortal Instruments type book for me to obsess over. That being said, I was definitely disappointed. 
 Beautiful Creatures is told from the perspective of Ethan Wate, living in a one horse textbook southern town. I have to say, I did really like the setting of the book. I think that Southern towns have such a rich history that a perfect for building a mystery around. All Ethan wants to do is escape Gatlin and not end up stuck there in the predictable like everyone else. In walks Lena and everything changes. He's drawn to her, despite her black sheep reputation in town, but all she wants is for him to stay away. 
 Overall I thought it was decent, but nothing about the premise or the story pulled me in. I was uninterested in the characters and what happened to them, and I didn't think the love story was all that great.

 I had heard a lot of hype around this book before I read it, and I have to say that while it completely deserves the recognition it is getting, it's not at all what I expected it to be. 
 From what I heard about the book, it was the story of self-proclaimed fat girl Willowdeen Dickenson, who decided to enter the town beauty pageant. I also heard that it was hilariously funny. 
 But funny was not what I walked away with from this book. I also didn't think that Willowdeen was as confident as she was made out to be. She was a girl that wanted to be confident and was working to get there, but she still had her insecurities. It was also a lot more serious and heart-wrenching than I expected. I don't know if I would consider this book funny. There were times when Willowdeens sarcasm creates a very dry humor, but this is not a book that is supposed to make you laugh. As Willowdeen would say, she is not the jolly best friend here for your entertainment. This is a book that is supposed to make you think and feel something, and that's exactly what it does.",Wed Sep 23 18:31:24 -0700 2015,Fri Apr 01 14:35:53 -0700 2016,Thu Nov 05 00:00:00 -0800 2015,Mon Nov 02 00:00:00 -0800 2015,1,0

The synopsis makes it seem like the book is going to be about something completely different. I felt like there was just a lot going on in this book and it didn't come together for me in a satisfying way at all. I could see the ending coming from almost the beginning of the book, but I was hoping there would be a different bigger twist that would redeem the story for me and keep things interesting. To me, this book was really similar to We Were Liars, so maybe that was why I could guess the ending so easily. 
 Aside from the disappointing conclusion to the mystery of the book, I didn't really like any of the characters at all. Dara and Nick both annoyed me equally and that made it even harder to like the book. But I will say that I love Lauren Oliver's writing style, so that was a redeeming quality for me, because I felt like it was really beautifully written, and I was very curious about how things were going to end, which led me to read the book very quickly.

I loved absolutely everything about this book. This was Rowell's first time writing fantasy and she did not disappoint! I think because it isn't her usual genre of choice, she brought a really different style to the book. One thing I particularly loved was her magical world building. It was a really creative premise. 
 I usually tend not to enjoy stand alone fantasy type books as much as I do series because you don't get as much character development and it usually feels rushed to me, but that wasn't the case at all with this book. In fact, it is probably my favorite stand alone fantasy to date. It is packed with TONS of character development and everything about the characters world was well explained and not confusing or rushed at all. It is a larger book and the beginning is a little slower because it gives you a lot of context, but it is definitely worth it. 
 I noticed that most of the negative reviews of this book were centered around the fact that this book was similar to or copying Harry Potter. It was similar to Harry Potter in a lot of ways, but this did not bother me. For one thing, at the end of the book Rowell writes in her author's note that Carry On is HER take on the typical ""Chosen One"" type story. So naturally, a story about the ""chosen one"" would have similarities to Harry Potter, because that's what Harry Potter is. Personally, I liked the similarities to Harry Potter, because I liked how it was kind of the same but ultimately different, if that makes any sense. I love the Harry Potter stories, so of course I would like things that are similar, but this book stands out and is special in its own right.",Wed Sep 16 10:56:08 -0700 2015,Sun May 22 11:02:55 -0700 2016,Sun Jan 10 00:00:00 -0800 2016,Tue Jan 05 00:00:00 -0800 2016,1,0

 Speak tells the story of an incoming Freshman starting high school as an outsider. Having busted a party during the summer, all of her old friend, and pretty much everyone else in school, hate her. Speak features a very clique orientated and exclusive high school, and even though my high school experience was nothing like Melinda's, Anderson writes with such a beautiful and honest prose that it is so easy to relate to the story and relate to the feeling of being an outsider. 
 One of the things I enjoyed most about this story was Anderson's character development. Every character in the story felt real, all like people you've met before. A common mistake that authors make when writing shy characters is unintentionally writing them without a personality. Melinda is quiet-- but she still has a voice, and I enjoyed her as a character.

The super powers in this book are really unique and it was fascinating to learn how each different one worked--that was definitely my favorite aspect of the book. I thought this book was original and it took me by suprise a couple of times. One thing I will say about the audio book is that I wish they would have cast different voice actors for each point of view, but the person reading did a pretty good job of doing different voices.

What if you were just a random student at Hogwarts, trying to pass your OWLs while watching Harry, Ron, and Hermoine running around doing whatever it is they do? 
 This book is extremely well written. It's told in first person, and the tone is really authentic and relatable. The other thing I really liked about this book was that it was just so different. It covered issues like mental disability, sexuality, and race and worked them naturally into the story in a way that I have never seen done before. I feel like the majority of young adult fiction should be headed in this direction. 
 What I thought made the book really cool was that at the beginning of each chapter you got a little blurb about what the chosen kids were doing, which followed all the tropes a story like that normally would. But the story wasn't boring. If anything, it showed that everyone is the protagonist in their own life, and even if you don't feel special, or you're not the chosen one, you still have a story worth telling. 
 The one thing that really made the story for me was that the plot stayed true to itself throughout the entire story. I liked the idea of telling a story through the innocent average bystanders eyes, and I was worried for awhile that the main character was suddenly going to become the hero, but the story didn't need that.

Graves brings to life the remarkable awfulness of life within the Roman Empire, and demonstrates with alarming exactness how bad people can be, given motive and opportunity. The maxim that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely is demonstrated here in spades. Paranoia and bloodlust within the few ruling families of ancient Italy are rampant, but the level-headed Claudius holds your faith that good might ultimately ""triumph"" (i.e., until the whole thing goes downhill again--why can't human society ever achieve sustained equilibrium?).

 My favorite part of the historical/anthropological analysis was an exegesis of the meaning of the tree of knowledge of good and evil from the story of the garden of Eden. I had always wondered about that tree. What was it about the knowledge of good and evil that could possibly be upsetting to God? The most plausible explanation I had been able to find was that humans put themselves on the same level as God, lording it over creation with their knowledge of good and evil. The author puts this story in its historical context and it becomes clear just what was (or rather, is, because as the book makes clear, it's still all very much with us today) going on here.

 Some reviewers think that this novel is critical of evangelicals, or Christians, or religion in general. Others think that it is critical of atheists. I think it is critical of both, and lies somewhere in that elegant twilight zone where everyone who is certain is most certainly wrong. There is the thought running through this and her other works that old school Christianity supplied something essential to the individual psyche and that modern American thought, in its unending search for ""true happiness"", has forgotten what it was, and has forgotten the unloved and forgotten souls along with it. And when you get right down to it, we are all, at one or more times in our lives, feeling forgotten or unloved. In O'Connor's fiction, nothing is clear.

Even my elderly parents seemed to enjoy the bit of the volume that they read to their grandchildren last spring. There is no heaven or heroic rescue in these stories, only instance after instance of well-intentioned people finding reasons to do nothing, well-intentioned people mistakenly trusting villains, and villains running around deceiving adults again and again. There are also many instances of people following pop philosophies such as ""give people what they want"", ""a fair deal"" and ""rules must be followed"" to inflict the most pitiless and harmful abuse on innocent people, repeatedly. While these volumes were written between rise of the internet bubble (does anyone even remember that?) and the crash of Wall Street in 2008 (due to fake and dubious loans), which was punctuated by terrorism, torture and a war based on fear and fakery, the trend toward fear and fakery has only accelerated since then, and these stories continue to be quite timely. 
 Here are some quotes from the Carnivorous Carnival: 
 ""The story of the Baudelaires does not take place in a fictional land where lollipops grow on trees and singing mice do all of the chores. The story of the Baudelaires takes place in a very real world, where some people are laughed at just because they have something wrong with them, and where children can find themselves all alone in the world, struggling to understand the sinister mystery that surrounds them, and in this real world the arrival of lions means that the story is about to get much worse ..."" 
 The carnival ""freaks"" are then recruited by Esme Squalor, ""the sixth most important financial advisor to the city,"" to throw not one of the carnival ""freaks"" but the fortune-teller, Madame Lulu, to the lions. 
 ""Don't think of it as murder,"" Esme said. ""Think of it as a dramatic exercise. It's a special surprise for Count Olaf that will prove to him that you're brave enough to join his troupe."" 
 ""Throwing Lulu into a pit of lions doesn't strike me as particularly brave,"" Colette said. ""Just cruel and vicious."" 
 ""How can it be cruel and vicious to give people what they want?"" Esme asked. ""You want to joint Count Olaf's troupe, the crowd wants to see someone eaten by lions, and I want Madame Lulu thrown into the pit. Tomorrow, one of you will have the exciting opportunity to give everybody exactly what they want."" ... ""When you put it like that,"" Hugo said thoughtfully, ""it doesn't sound so bad."" 
 And when the Bauldelaire orphans wake up the day of the ""show"", they meet a large crowd of carnival visitors who are excitedly looking forward to the throwing of some ""freak"" into the lion pit.",Mon Apr 04 01:37:41 -0700 2016,Wed Feb 08 21:24:27 -0800 2017,,Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 -0800 2017,0,0

And, to be honest, interest in the seediness, and the motivations of its denizens, was the motivating factor in wanting to read it. 
 The writing is consistently solid and reporterly throughout; but rarely does the author relate any odd statement, or any strange incident, or delve into the motivations, situations of those involved in the business. He does not even manage to figure out what is going on with the murdered woman's father, who seems to be all over the map, from boldly traveling halfway around the world and camping out in Tokyo to get the police to solve the case, to, for example, running up a hug bar tab while frequenting the hostess bars of Roppongi himself. What is going on here, and what are the facts? It is never revealed. Was the killer, a Korean immigrant, a victim of discrimination in Japan, and was that a factor in his odd personality, or not? This is only hinted at but not probed. What is the nature of the job of the self-styled Roppongi ""financial advisor (and who the hell is this guy?)""? Not investigated. What is going on with that S&M club and why did one of its members commit suicide? No answers are provided. What was the personality of the head of the investigation like? We don't find out.

 In your idealistic eye, Walt Whitman! Yuval Noah Harari is iconoclasm at its near best. The chapter on the agricultural revolution alone nearly pays for the entire book. [Of course, the agricultural revolution cannot be fraud in the actionable sense of the word if the error in assumptions versus the impact of actions is not visible for several hundred (thousand?) years... But the astonishing use of the long lens of history is one of the fun and informative aspects of Harari's approach.] 
 Yuval boils down reams of archeological, psychological and anthropological discoveries in restating for our own enlightenment the entire arc of human history. The arc of human history looked at in this new light is both beautiful [history's empires were inevitable and not so different from what they replaced] and disturbing [empires are inevitable and not so different from what they replace] and in the end it seems we shall only serve to enhance the survival of our coming bio-technic overlords. 
 But I cannot help also thinking that the arguments of the book are overdone. 
 The author is too slick in a number of places, but he is out to smash some well-accepted tropes, so onward with the wrecking ball! But there is also room for second thoughts. For example, on the agricultural revolution: Yes, it turned out not to be an improvement looked at in the long lens of history, but no one lifetime has that lens, and if the cultural improvements that arose from staying in one place are given weight, does the agricultural revolution still look like a fraud? 
 For example, should we really be so excited about the coming singularity where bionic robot people will be our new kings? I mean, it is bad enough now, where the top management of IT companies, venture capital and banks think they are God's gift to the rest of us dumbstruck plebians, but when they actually have the computing power to undoubtedly support their point of view, what then?

It won the Man Booker Prize in 2011. I don't understand. At first, it was good, denser than most novels, so I felt as if I had covered more than twenty pages of content when I was only on page nine. Nevertheless, I strained for something to happen, for the plot to thicken, so to speak--for the soup of this novel to boil into a rich, textured story of shock and morality. Instead, when all the steam had boiled away there was nothing left. The writing contained some sharp observations about time and memory, yes, and these built up expectations of some awful revelation. But the revelation never comes. The stone is slowly rolled away, and low and behold, the body is still there. 
 But there seems to be more here than meets the eye. What really happened is subject to debate and reading of clues. 
 Even the narrator may not fully understand even at the end. It leaves the reader wondering--not questioning her own views of things, but just wondering what happened in the story. 
 And I don't think that is a good result for a story. Even if the narrator does not get it, the readers should, and on whether they do I give you the lively debate on Goodreads as Exhibit A. 
 PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT: 
 I felt that the apparent acts of Adrian were completely out of character. If he is so bold, then why do it? Why not face reality like a man? He strikes me as the gutless character in a Chekov tale rather than the bold youth he is built up to be. And why is Veronica angry with the narrator? Because of some unkind letter written 40 years ago? I don't understand what the narrator has to feel guilty about here. He had nothing to do with the actions of Adrian.

There are also criticisms of Cold War militarism and racist colonialism. All of these are more dated than informative. Somewhat like reading a LIFE magazine from 1944--it does not give you any new information, but it is useful as a window onto the popular outlooks of the time. For the most part, reading this book was like reading diary entries by an unhappy writer who complains about the persons she interacts with in a prose that is barely leavened with any kind of wit or linguistic pyrotechnics, and which is fairly banal, though meticulous, in its observations. I did greatly enjoy, however, the description of the fictional author's interactions with the British movie and television producers and the American theater producer. Her send up of these folks' trivial understanding of her fictional work was very funny and insightful.

It is about the sadness of the passage of time and things unsaid and human weakness. It is about how a small group of Americans experienced what life was like here/there.

 ""I felt no shame whatsoever in these activities [park janitor], because I understood what almost no one else seemed to grasp: that there was only an infinitesimal difference, a difference so small that it barely existed except as a figment of the human imagination, between working in a tall green glass building on Park Avenue and collecting litter in a park. If fact, there may have been no difference at all.""

Reading it, I got the same feeling I got reading about the sword of heaven at the end of Chang Tzu. There are more of these little surprises scattered throughout the book. There is another surprise in this book, and that is the Powerpoint presentation.

The book is more complicated, more painful and more fruity. The story of what European economic exploitation does to African farmers is reminiscent of what happened to the Native Americans, and what India, with the sometime blessing of the World Bank, did to its own indigenous farmers (see, e.g., essays by Arundhati Roy), and has been repeated everywhere, as far back as the industrial revolution (see, The Industrial Revolution in England by Paul Mantoux, and The Great Transformation by Karl Polanyi). Viz.: The new economic world is coming and if you don't play by its rules you are well and thoroughly screwed. So, Midwesterners, if you are in the way of fracking, beware. 
 But back to this novel: the men here start out bad, yet, perhaps due to Walker's sunny outlook, most end up turning good. What I found most fruity was the ... pants. The pants and the astonishing ability of all the women to right their situations, of their men to see the light, and of the long lost to be ... well, you can sort of see it coming.

Herland is a strong entry into the Lennon ""Imagine"" category of wishful thinking ... asking us to think about what it would be like if everyone could get control of their pride and look at things differently. It is the ""everyone"" that is always the problem, because, as the writer points out, at least one third of the population (i.e., ""Terry"") is always never going to get there. When the Utopia is in fact a Distopia, such as imagined by Huxley, Orwell, or Ayn Rand, having that one third backstop usually helps prevent disaster, but only in fiction, not in reality--see, e.g., Hitler's dystopia and Nazi Germany. Herland does set out a good critique of society, and has some punchy, biting scenes where the women from Herland ask some pointed questions about male-female society that the men from America cannot adequately answer. 
 The Yellow Wallpaper shows off Perkins' perceptive and expressive powers.

 This is a good novel to read after reading Rhodes' ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb,"" as this is essentially the fiction companion to that. It's not about making the bomb, though, it's about scientists and their relationship with the rest of us, with some jabs at jingoism along the way. 
 The author's hatred of women was distasteful, but then he doesn't seem to like men that much either. Perhaps one cannot blame this attitude on someone who witnessed the aftermath of the bombing of Dresden firsthand. Certainly Ambrose Bierce, another war spawned hater of man, deserves a pass. Primo Levi, though, is the better writer.

 To wit: 
 ""The little code of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid down as the mainsprings of all Madam Nature's deeds and actions; the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady's proceedings to matters of maxim and theory, and, by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling ... I do not mean to assert that it is the practice of renowned and learned sages at all to shorten the road to any great conclusion, their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings .... Still I do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable practice of all mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories, to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves. Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong, and you may take any means which the end to be attained will justify; the amount of the right or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher concerned: to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive, and impartial view of his own particular case.""

 and when you get older some money to spare.""

I was not disappointed. There are several indications of despair in the book, but for the most part it is DFW hard at work on wry jokes, long detailed descriptions, interesting personal stories for selected characters and a bit of informative social discussion/analysis. The de rigor shit and booger jokes are classic DFW, but mostly it is high level wit. The narrative is, as one would expect, disjointed, but characters are developed and stories are told, and the pieces tie together with each other. There is no ending or even any trajectory or arc, because, sadly, we all know the ending. 
 A REQUEST: 
 Back in 2009 or 2010 the New Yorker published a short story by DFW that, since it appeared shortly (within 12 months?) after another DFW short story that was from The Pale King (the tax examiner piece on boredom), I had assumed it was also from this book. The story was about a boy who received a toy cement mixer one Christmas and his parents told him that the cement mixer would move on its own. The narrator describes the boy's painful efforts to catch the cement mixer moving on-its-own, but he never could. It ended on a scene with his father watching reports on the Vietnam War on the evening news. I subsequently lost the issue, and have searched the New Yorker's on line archive in vain (their search function is a bad joke). I thought it was part of the Pale King but alas it is not.

The thought of the hero being a virgin was intriguing, but I was pretty sure I was going to be doing some serious eye-rolling. But I didn't, and I don't think you will either. 
 What I liked: The hero and the heroine both made absolute sense. This book reminded me a lot of Wait For You in the fact that they are neighbors, and both have issues. I really liked Bennet, and completely understood why he was waiting once more about his family was revealed. Avery was great too, and I never found myself ready to strangle her, which is always a bonus. There is a really sweet side-storyline about an elderly lady that Avery takes care of in a nursing home, and through her we see that Avery isn't nearly as tough as she wants everyone to think she is.

 I really can't say enough good things about this book. 
 What I liked: First and foremost, this book was unpredictable. Most of the time, with NA Romance we know the hero and heroine are going to be together. But in Where My Heart Breaks, nothing about their relationship is a sure thing. There are lots of reasons for them not to be together. It would be entirely relatable and believable if Katie ran in the other direction--not because he wasn't a good guy, but because she was truly trying to make a fresh start. Specifically one that didn't involve her being wrapped up in a boy. 
 One of the main parts of the plot revolves around a famous novel that was written about the Inn where Katie is staying for the summer, and in several scenes it is almost as is Katie is reliving the novel. But the novel featured inside the book has a tragic ending, and this kept me very on edge, worrying that Katie's own fate might be tragic. 
 Is it? 
 Come on now, you didn't think I'd spoil that for you, did you? 
 I will tell you that I was completely and utterly satisfied by the end of the book, and I'm so glad I read this. 
 What I didn't like: 
 The beginning seemed a little rocky. I was almost positive that were about to drive right into predictable tropes. Her car breaks down. A hot guy stops to help her. They are going to have instant chemistry, right? 
 Nope. He was sort of an ass, and while she was attracted to him, there was no almost kiss or any other cliche. I both liked and disliked that, because I was happy for some originality, but I was also hoping for that kiss. 
 My Recommendation: Where My Heart Breaks is fantastic and should go right to the top of your TBR.",Sun Aug 25 18:09:51 -0700 2013,Sat Sep 14 12:33:02 -0700 2013,Sun Aug 25 00:00:00 -0700 2013,Sun Aug 25 00:00:00 -0700 2013,3,0

 Then I got reading other things and it sat beside my bed, untouched for 2 weeks. 
 My only regret about reading this book is that I didn't read it sooner. I'm freaking out over how good it seriously is. I read on average 5 books a week and after a while they all start to blur together. YA, boiled down, is Girl meets boy. Girl and boy shouldn't be together but they want to be. Girl and boy overcome it. 
 This is not that book. 
 Wow. 
 There was so much growth between the characters. The world and magic system is so richly developed it nearly pops off the page. Every character has a history, each little clue weaves together to draw a map to what you can expect at the end. 
 The only thing I slightly didn't like was how the prologue and the other few scenes with that pair of characters together felt a bit off. I think it could have been told straight through without Aurthur's POV. But I did understand how that gave a new layer to the storytelling and it wasn't a major gripe. I did like how it shows how far Evie's acceptance of her abilities has come.

 This is one of those times where I really wish amazon allowed for us to give half stars because this is more like 4 1/2 but I just can't quite give it 5. 
 I liked it. I definitely liked it, I'm glad I read it and I highly recommend it. 
 Let's start with what I liked: 
 I really enjoy the hero. He isn't overdone, overrich, overperfect or any of those other irritating things that he could have been. He was just sweet, sexy, protective, strong, and so so steamy. His character felt real, and I loved that about this book. I can totally see the guy being protective of his truck (but letting her drive it...swoon) and I like how he doesn't flaunt his achievements. I adore that he took her to meet his parents. 
 I also really liked Katie. She's a great heroine, and she isn't stupid, whiny or weak. 
 The mystery was relatively well done. A few of the clues, such as the tv broadcast were a bit too obvious and shoehorned in, but since I was reading this for romance, not mystery, it didn't really bother me. 
 Now for what I didn't like: 
 I don't have any faith that Katie and Holt know each other well enough to go the distance. I would like to see them be ok as a couple without all the extenuating circumstances and I feel like the end/epilogue is just a little bit too neat and tidy. I think if it was set a few years in the future, it would have left me with more of a sense of their love being real, and able to stand the test of time.",Thu Aug 15 12:48:54 -0700 2013,Thu Aug 15 12:49:09 -0700 2013,,,1,0

 Here are the reasons I'm giving this a one: 
 --There is no resolution at the end. I'm ok with cliffhangers, but I'm not okay with a cliffhanger in place of any real resolution whatsoever. 
 --It is categorized as a romance, which gave me certain expectations, but those expectations weren't met (What I expect out of a romance is that there should at least be a couple that is a fair amount of the focus for most of the book. I also prefer a HEA or a HFN, though in *some* cases I can overlook it.) 
 --There were a few rough editing areas. If it was this alone that bugged the crap out of me, I wouldn't have rated it so low, but with the other factors considered, I'm afraid it is a one. 
 --Lily's ""Poor me, everyone hates me, I guess I'll go cry as a wolf so you'll scratch my ears"" drove me freaking batty. 
 Here are the reasons that I would have given it a three, IF the issues above weren't present (In other words, if you don't care that this is portrayed as a romance, and aren't looking for a romance, and cliffhangers that don't resolve anything at all don't bother you, you will like this better than I did.) 
 --There was so much potential with this. The worldbuilding was not very smoothly or seamlessly done, but there was a lot of it. The author truly created a fascinating world, with so much history and culture, and while it could have been done better, I enjoyed it. 
 --There are several fascinating characters, and I enjoyed the close friendship between the four. I wish we got to know Pearl and Jack better, but I liked Ezra a lot. 
 That's about all I can say without spoiling it. If you don't care about spoilers, or have already read it or decided you aren't going to, see more below. 
 ***Major, ranty, annoyed spoilers below, including spoiling the end.*** 
 (view spoiler)[ I'm really, seriously ticked off. There is NO resolution. I don't mind cliffhangers, but I do mind when a book isn't cohesive, and doesn't leave me with some satisfaction. 
 This is something that could have been great. There is so much to the world and the details about the world and their customs. I mean honestly, the potential here is just immense. There were some choppy and rough parts that I think needed to be reworked to be a bit better, but overall, the writing was fine. 
 In the end though, we know nothing. The only thing we had any resolution on was if she could do an awakening, and I never had any doubt over that. 
 But the Kings still don't know she's a hybrid, we still don't know what Ezra's idea about home bases was, they are now on the run-- and how did the com revolt against them get this big this fast without anyone realizing it? WTF? And what was up with that letter from her mom and her uncle? That's just random at the end, and felt ridiculous, and stupid. It made zero sense. And Ventclaire still doesn't know he's her dad. Or is he, even? Lily assumes so, but maybe he has a hot brother that Lily's mom boinked too, we really don't know. 
 She's supposed to rule people, but we almost only ever see her interact with the other Prodigies. 
 And the Romance? Seriously? Dominic dies, every other Prodigy's mate dies. Her and Ezra seem like they could maybe have something, but it isn't really explored. Ugh! It is in the romance/fantasy category on Amazon, but this is definitely NOT a romance. There is no HEA or HFN or even a defined couple.

 What I liked: 
 I've been seeing this book around for quite a while now so I was thrilled to find it at the library. It's quick and to the point which was nice, though I think it could have been a little longer. It's told through alternating time points: now and 6 months in the past. I really liked the way the two story arcs wove together, helping me to understand the choices and mistakes in the past that lead Nikki to her current predicament. It made her a sympathetic character. I liked her personality a lot, she never struck me as stupid or selfish or whiny. 
 What I didn't like: 
 I'm not sure if it was so much that I didn't like it, but I didn't really feel the romance and love between Nikki and Jack. He was sweet and a good guy, but this didn't feel like a go through hell and back to be together kind of love. 
 My recommendation:

 What I liked: 
 I found a lot of things to like about Crown of Midnight. I think I highlighted nearly half the book, noting down things I loved or writing that struck me as awesome. 
 One of the first themes I really enjoyed was seeing how Celaena had to withstand the burden of hiding the fact that she isn't actually killing her targets and she had to bear the burden of her friends looking disgusted with her, thinking she was killing them. She accepted their judgement and criticism, to protect them while risking her neck to protect the innocent. 
 I also love the developments between her and Chaol. In Throne of Glass there was a strong hint of romance to come, but in Crown of Midnight we truly get to see how much they have come to mean to each other. He's her safety. Her person. And he is learning to trust her. My favorite part was about 45% in, when we see just how much she has changed him and his priorities. I think I'd want Chaol for myself if his girlfriend wasn't a deadly assassin who is as lethal is she is beautiful. 
 The plot was definitely good. It moved quickly and the foreshadowing especially was expertly done. There were several times where I had an idea of what was coming, but I could never be sure. Crown of Midnight overall didn't follow a predictable or boring pattern, I was enthralled, frantically reading to see what would happen next. 
 Crown of Midnight is the type of book I will reread over and over again, because every moment spent reading it was a pleasure. 
 What I didn't like: 
 There really wasn't anything about the book I didn't like, honestly. I loved it that much. The only thing I have to complain about is the fact that now I have to wait for book 3. There were some major revelations, especially toward the end, and I'm definitely left wanting more. 
 My recommendation: 
 If you haven't read Throne of Glass yet, drop everything and read it, now. That way you can move on to Crown of Midnight because it is one of the new pillars of YA Fantasy, truly a must read. I

This book is a lot more suspense/adventure driven than romance driven, and is a nice break from the typical YA Fantasy/Romance. There's a little bit of magic, and a little bit of romantic intrigue that I think may play a larger factor in the next book, but they definitely take a back seat to Cel's struggle to win the contest to be the king's champion. 
 I think one of the things I loved most about Throne of Glass was how the main plot was set up. Celaena has two bad choices--win the contest to get a position she really and truly doesn't want, or be sent back to a death camp. She's fighting for her freedom, but for the short term, freedom is just another type of prison. 
 Throne of glass has a relatively large cast of characters and I enjoyed most of them. The young prince, Dorian, is not what he seems at first, and he has a conscience. It remains to be seen if he'll develop the spine to go along with it, but I liked his character a lot, though I would like to have known more about him. 
 Chaol, the head guard, is brooding and doesn't trust Cel, but I loved him the longer I read. He's worried for both Dorian and Celaena, and he has the guts to act on what he thinks is right. 
 There is also a foreign princess, Nehemia, and I enjoyed the intrigue and secrets surrounding her. 
 One thing that did confuse me at times was the time period. I really couldn't get a firm idea of what the level of technology would equate to. They seem to wear old fashioned dresses, all though when it is prudent Celaena dons pants and shirts, they use candles for light and travel by horseback but they play games of pool and chess and cards, and have large libraries with trashy romance novels. There were other more modern touches as well, which seemed a bit out of place.",Sun Jul 21 13:38:41 -0700 2013,Sun Jul 21 13:38:53 -0700 2013,Sun Jul 21 13:38:53 -0700 2013,,1,0

 I loved this book, and I hated this book. I still haven't made up my mind yet whether it is 4 stars or two stars, so I'm going to explain my reasons for both, and let you decide for yourself. 
 What I loved: 
 Even though the first few pages were a bit hard to sink into, by the 3rd chapter I was hooked. Amy was nothing special, but Liam is intoxicatingly hot. 
 The suspense in this book is really what propelled me forward. There is a big mystery, and lots of pieces of the puzzle to try to work out, and that had my brain furiously reading on, wanting more clues. 
 There was a fair amount of sex in this book, a lot more than say in Easy or Hopeless, and it was relatively detailed in some parts ( though not in others.) I thought all in all that was well done, and not cheesy like some books with tons of sex can tend to be. The characters really couldn't keep their hands off each other. 
 What I hated: 
 This is only half a book. And I don't just mean that because it is short (though it is quite short - a bit shorter than Damaged.) As soon as we get to the start of the climax of the story, it ends. I feel cheated, and I got this book for free. Had I paid for it, I would have returned it. 
 Don't get me wrong. The story itself is good. What's here of it, anyway. But it left off the end. This isn't just a cliffhanger. It's a lack of ending. (And a lack of any HFN or HEA) I think a cliffhanger can be good if the story wraps up some plot threads, and leaves other plot threads to be resolved during the series. But this doesn't do that. It feels like a cheap ploy, and as a reader it infuriated me. I would have bought the next book anyway because Lisa Renee Jones' writing is very good and entertaining, and because I was enjoying the story. But now I have no faith that the next book will give me an actual ending. 
 So 4 stars or 2 stars? 
 Based on the writing and the story and the plot, right up until the point where the book cuts off, I would have given it four stars, but I feel like since I only got half the book, maybe the book should only get half the rating? 
 My Recommendation: 
 Wait until book 2 comes out, check reviews to see if there is satisfactory resolution in the end, and if so buy them both because the story will leave you entertained and Liam will make you swoon. But for now, hold onto your pennies.",Wed Jul 17 11:34:47 -0700 2013,Fri Jul 19 15:36:21 -0700 2013,Fri Jul 19 15:36:21 -0700 2013,,0,0

I still remember reading The Awakening in school. And To Kill A Mockingbird. Those books made an impression that lasted, and so did Ten Tiny Breaths. 
 Reading it left me feeling lost and devastated and then healed, right along with Kacey. It's the type of book that becomes a part of you, and you think that Kacey and Trent live down the hall from you. 
 What I liked: 
 I really liked Kacey - She was a believable and admirable character. She took a bad situation, and did the best she could for her sister, even at the expense of herself. She held on to her anger, but who could blame her? She has morals, and she's not whiny, and she keeps her promises. I found a lot to like about her, and very little to complain about. 
 What I (almost) didn't like: 
 At one point, I started to get a suspicion about the ""explosive secret"" mentioned in the book blurb, and discounted it as too far out there and unbelievable. Then of course, my suspicions turned out to be right, and for a few minutes I was really irritated. It was just too odd, and I couldn't buy it. But then, as the reasons and the details came to light, I realized I did buy it, and it did make sense, and it broke my heart. 
 At that point, I was so firmly invested in Kacey and Trent's that Kacey's grief became completely palpable, leaving me feeling quite wrecked. Fortunately, this book doesn't end of a cliffhanger, and by the end I'd put myself back together right along with Kacey, but the journey to get there was one heck of a thrill ride. 
 This story was more sweet than steamy, but Trent was yummy and Kacey was a fun main character to follow, make for quite a pleasurable read.

 I love JLA. Like, I'd have her alien babies sort of love JLA. So maybe I went into this book with slightly above average expectations. But I was sort of disappointed. 
 Don't get me wrong. Frigid is good, but that's just it. It's good. I'm sorry, but from JLA, I expect greatness. 
 What I liked: 
 Kyler. I really, really liked Kyler. Sure, he's got some man-whore issues, but mostly he's a good guy. He holds Sydney to unreasonably high expectations (sort of like mmine for JLA?) which creates all sorts of problems between them, but when it comes right down to it, he's there for her and he has been since they were kids. Kyler is protective, and sweet, and knows just how sexy he is. 
 The plot was also good, though a bit contrived with the snowstorm, I could look past it because I really liked the way this wasn't a simple yo-yo of boy meets girl, girl leaves boy, girl and boy have makeup sex. There was a pretty significant and mysterious plot and although the who-done-it aspect was quite transparent and I never had a doubt who was behind it, it added another layer of tension that I enjoyed. 
 Frigid is also quite funny at times, and this is a trademark of JLA's character. She writes witty, funny characters, who are as entertaining as they are sexy, and this book is no different in that regard. 
 What I didn't like: 
 Sydney. She's so freaking stupid, I wanted to smack her. This isn't an entirely new thing for JLA's heroines, but where in the Lux series I don't love Katy, and I sometimes hate the things she does toward Daemon, I liked Syndey way less. She's whiny, and oblivious and if she would pull her head out of her ass and grow up the book would have been about four pages long. So then we would have had way less Kyler, so maybe it's good that she's dense, but still. It got irritating. For a girl going to school to be a psychologist, she has a serious handicap when it comes to understanding what people are trying to say. Someone will tell her they feel a little sad and she'll be sure they just threatened to jump off a bridge. Seriously, she drove me bonkers. 
 The editing in this book was acceptable, but I did find six or seven typos, and while that isn't excessive and I do realize this is a small press book, I was a bit surprised by it. Mistakes happen, and I get that, but this felt more like an ARC than a finished product. 
 In summary: 
 Would I recommend it? You bet I would. Despite a whiny heroine, and a few editing snafus, reading any JLA book is a pleasure, and is absolutely worth the time spent reading it.",Wed Jul 17 05:26:40 -0700 2013,Tue Jul 23 05:47:09 -0700 2013,Wed Jul 17 00:00:00 -0700 2013,Wed Jul 17 00:00:00 -0700 2013,0,0

I read Hopeless about 3 days before Losing Hope, and I never got bored, because there was so much that was new.

 Judging by the blurb, I expected to find myself crying through this entire book and yet I didn't shed a single tear. I truly felt ambivalent to the characters, and their plight. I think the only one I did identify with at all was Drew, and maybe the mom. 
 I had zero sympathy with Saylor, and I didn't feel for her at all. Some of the details about Munchhausen didn't fit with things I've read about it, either ( not that I'm an expert ) and Saylor was so coldly ambivalent, analytical and detached, that I couldn't help feeling that way about her. 
 What I did like was how crisp the writing was. I could truly see the characters and the surroundings and Saylor had a distinct voice. I was never bored while reading, I never got annoyed, but I just wasn't entertained or enamored either. 
 I can't imagine how hard it is to write about a character like this, and I think it is great to explore such hard topics, it just unfortunately didn't grab me the way I'd hoped.

I was a tiny bit disappointed when I noticed it was relatively short, but as soon as I started reading all disappointment fled. I do think the page count above may be an error or an overestimate. The location count on my kindle was approximately 2000, compared to 3300 for Damaged 1. 
 Sidney and Peter broke my heart in the first few pages and I was instantly drawn in. I came to care about these two so much in the first book, I was thrilled to immerse myself in more of their story. We picked up right where book 1 left off, with no real gap in time at all. But Peter immediately reveals a secret that freaks Sidney out, and that sets the tone for the first part of the book. There were times when I thought Sidney was being an idiot, and making stupid mistakes, but I think that adds depth to her, because people aren't perfect. 
 Peter is so much more twisted and haunted than I thought, but for both of them this book is a chance at healing. Peter is such a swoon-worthy character, and that has definitely not changed between the books. I was able to see how different he was now that his secret was out, and I think that helped me related to how Sidney was feeling with trying to accept the truth. 
 I had worried a little bit that I might be lost or confused because I haven't read The Arrangement series at all, but I wasn't. I've read the description of The Arrangement so I know which characters crossed over, and there were no problems with meeting those characters for the first time. I didn't feel lost at all. I didn't like Sean very much, and I wonder if that would be different if I'd read the other series, but I did like Avery. I do get the impression that Sean means well, and his part in the end made my draw completely drop. 
 I loved that we got the end of the story, without a cliffhanger, and I thought the end was very rewarding. 
 I laughed and cried then laughed some more. Between the turkey and the coffee and their banter, it was just an all around delight. I really didn't expect it to be so darn funny, but it was. I constantly laughed at the things they were saying to each other. I think because it is dealing with Sidney's dark past, I expected it to be very emotional, and while parts definitely were, the humor helped keep this one lighter than Damaged 1. 
 The content was sexy but not explicit, and I think this book is perfect for anyone who likes romance of any heat level. 
 In conclusion, if you liked book 1, I highly suspect you will like book 2. It was a rewarding read, and my only complaint is the length. But I am not even too disappointed by that because the pacing was perfect. I'd rather an enjoyable short read than a long read that drags and bores me. I would not recommend reading this book until after you've read Damaged, because I think you would lose a lot of the context without the first part of their story.",Wed May 15 05:57:42 -0700 2013,Sun Jul 21 13:42:25 -0700 2013,Mon Jun 24 06:11:36 -0700 2013,,1,0

 This is a deeply moving, captivating and at times heartbreaking character journey for two people who have had to deal with so much more than anyone ever should. The relationship is weaved into the plot, it is an integral part of the plot, and while I wanted them to make it and manage to be together, what I wanted more than anything was for them to each find away to banish their inner demons and become whole, with or without each other. And I think that was a lot of what made this story so different - it wasn't a will they or won't they be together kind of story. It was about them becoming functioning human beings with a chance at happiness.

 I genuinely liked Fable and Drew, which is saying a lot for this type of book. Generally I find in NA contemporary, one character usually royally ticks me off. Either they treat each other like crap, or make really stupid choices, just so the author can force the characters to yo-yo together and apart to create tension and drama. 
 In this book, their hurdles come from the characters' baggage and it felt believable because it struck true to the previous characterization and truly made sense. They both honestly wanted to be good to each other, and wanted to help each other.

It really is hard to sort through the anger and the bitterness and venom circulating, to find reliable opinions about whether this book is any good or not. 
 My mother in law purchased it for her Nook, so after she went to bed I borrowed the nook and sat down to read. It took about four hours. 
 The most awful line of the book: He looked more prosperous than when he was broke. - Really? You don't say! 
 The best line of the book: ""Sookie. You are mine."" 
 I didn't like the non-Sookie Pov sections, and honestly I don't think they added to the story. If anything I think they only served as filler to lengthen the book. Which is truly sad, because in all actuality most of the book felt like filler. I was never able to settle into a cohesive plot because it seemed like each page was a new episode of ""who will show up for a brief reconciliation from their past wrongs today."" It felt like each character that has been important in the past that was still alive or undead showed up with an apology for how they'd wronged her in the past, only to help her for a scene, then be called away. The ones who couldn't come make a half-hearted apology followed by an excuse of why she isn't first to them, participated in the juvenile plot against her. 
 Eric isn't as much as shadow of himself as some of the reviews would lead you to be. We still get a ""Sookie, you are mine."" He does absolutely everything in his power to protect Sookie, even at the expense of himself. This, to me, was the best part of the book. I've known for so long that he does truly love her, and I think many of his actions showed it. While I don't agree with all of his actions, and some things were disappointing, I think their resolutions could have been carried out better. 
 After his trouble in the previous book, Sam truly is a shadow of himself in this volume. I saw nothing of the close friendship between them of the past, and he left me boggled a lot of the time. He did put Sookie first, and I suppose that should count for something, but his choice didn't seem reasonable or in character. 
 (view spoiler)[ 
 As far as Sookie and Eric not ending up together: it breaks my heart, but I think it could have been done in a way that I would have been able to accept. The reasons given (that he was determined to turn her, and she didn't want that) are valid and do make sense. But to be effective, it needed to be set up better. IF they weren't going to have a HEA together ( and I really wish they would have ) then I think they should have ended it a few books ago. They could have broken up, and then in book twelve they could have found a way to be friends, much like her and bill. They could have found a happily not together, but not out of each other's lives. Would I have been sad? Yes. But I would have understood. Then, the romance between her and Sam could have been a big undercurrent of book 12. We could have seen chemistry growing strongly, and even possible have been routing for them to wake up and realize it. Then she could have saved him in the end, we would cross our fingers that it would make a turning point, and this book could have clinched it ( as long as he was more present in it. ) 
 I entirely respect that Charlaine Harris had her own vision of how it should end. She is the author, after all. What I don't respect is the way it was carried out. She could have had this end, while still offering fans a sense of gratification for sticking with the series for 13 books. 
 In conclusion, if you are still on the fence about whether to read this or not, I would say it honestly doesn't matter. I don't think it offers any satisfying conclusion for anything. Even Sam and Sookie aren't a done deal. If you are looking for closure, maybe the coda will offer it. If you want to read it just so you will have read everything, then go for it.

 But I'd be lying. 
 I squealed, requested it, and then obsessively checked my emails for an approval notice like a rabid dog frothing at the mouth, slobbering and waiting for something to attack. So when the approval showed up I dropped everything, and read. 
 And now I'm sad, and wish I hadn't read it quite as fast... because the experience is over, and I have to wait for the next book. Just like Jesse stays with Lora, The Darkest Night will stay with me, but it isn't quite the same. 
 Shana's words are so magical, and musical they are really a divine delight to read. I find that when I'm reading her stories, the plot really takes a backburner to the pleasure of simply immersing myself in her prose. And her characters are so captivating, so vivid, I can't help forget this is fiction, not reality. 
 The characters we adored in The Sweetest Dark are back - Lora, Sophie, Armand (Though he is definitely changing, not nearly as much of a jerk as he seemed at first in the first book) and in his own star-like way, Jesse. I was thrilled that he wouldn't totally be gone, because I really like him. What surprised me is how much Armand is growing on me. I am usually very against love triangles, but in this case I really do love both Armand and Jesse, and I don't blame Lora a bit for being a bit torn between the two. Heck, I'm torn between the two. 
 The main characters are all so noble, and so selfless. If we didn't have Chloe to be a selfish brat, I'd think the entire cast a little too perfect. Fortunately, Chloe hasn't changed in the least, so not to worry. 
 The plot here only had one major surprise, and I cannot tell you what it is of course, but I think it will startle you as much as it startled me and Lora. This book is more about the character's journey after the aftermath. Armand is dealing with the fallout from his father's episode. Lora is sucked into the fallout from his Reginald's episode. It is about to be the summer break, and Lora isn't sure where she will go since she can't remain at Iverson (and isn't even sure if she can come back.) Jesse is no longer living, which tortures all the characters in their own way. One of the most poignant parts is when Mandy tells Lora he'd give her anything she wanted, but the only thing she wants is the one thing he can't give her. 
 I will definitely re-read this book just for the pleasure of going through the feelings of the characters again, and for the delight of sinking into Shana's world. The Darkest Night might be a bit sweeter than The Sweetest Dark, and it definitely left me wanting more.",Tue Apr 16 08:42:55 -0700 2013,Wed Aug 14 05:30:39 -0700 2013,Thu Apr 18 00:00:00 -0700 2013,,0,0

 I connected to Lora almost instantly. Not the things she saw, but just her raw, jagged edges. She is a tortured soul and I think most of us have felt that way at some point or other. Early in I desperately wanted to see her rise above her circumstances, put her twisty past behind her, and become more than another tragedy, another forgotten girl. 
 For so long she heard the voice inside her, but was told she was crazy until she believed them. And then, when finally someone told her that she wasn't, it was like he offered her salvation. I cried for her loved how it turns out that she isn't the bottom of the lowest of the low. Instead, she is one rare, precious being. 
 This book is almost entirely devoid of action, and almost even devoid of a plot. But yet I loved it. It felt like a reflective journey that was completely character driven. There were no real tension filled events dragging me through the story, but yet I couldn't put it down. The character is riveting and raw. 
 This story is dark. If you aren't in the mood for that, this isn't the right tale. Beneath Shana Abe's beautiful language and amazing imagery, lies a bittersweet tragedy. 
 I was so impressed with this book that I'd like to read more of the author's Drakon series. It looks like they may all be loosely connected.",Mon Jan 28 13:39:46 -0800 2013,Fri Feb 08 18:01:55 -0800 2013,Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 -0800 2013,Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 -0800 2013,0,0

 Reason it isn't closer to 5: It isn't something I would re-read. I felt it lacked the twists and turns and deply layered psychological plot that many of his best novels do. 
 If you've been a longtime fan of Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels like I am, you're likely thrilled that the 28th novel in the series, Guilt, has arrived! Guilt opens on a young mother-to-be reveling in the purchase of her first home. The scene is heavily laced with emotion and really spoke to me, dredging up all the memories of buying our house, having our children, and marital disagreements and then, in true suspenseful style, as soon as comfort sets in, Kellerman ripped the band-aid off. The young mother discovers the bones of an infant in her backyard. 
 Milo and Alex take up the case, and for the first half of the novel the reader is tantalized with the utter lack of information. With few clues to go on and more bodies appearing, the truly grotesque is in the imagination while Alex and Milo snatch at theories and not much else, trying to imagine just what exactly is going on. 
 One of the most enjoyable and rewarding factors of Guilt was getting a glimpse into Alex's childhood, keeping with the theme of children. I loved getting to know more about him, and I hope this trend continues for future books. Robin and Blanche make several appearances as well, and I have to say I hope to see them take their relationship to the next level. They are so good together. 
 Each of Kellerman's characters became a unique entity, with distinct voices and their own parts to play in the drama of the case, and we quickly see that not each of the involved parties are who they appear to be. From nannies to celebrities, most have secrets and it seems even Alex himself has a few secrets. The fun of it is sorting the secrets and lies from the truths and the reader will get to do that right along with Alex. 
 Guilt isn't quite as fast paced as many of Kellerman's books are, but it is sure to delight longtime fans of the series. However if you are new to Alex Delaware, this book stands on its own well enough that you'll be just fine jumping right in. If you like James Patterson's Alex Cross, be sure to check out the other crime-solving Alex--Kellerman's Alex Delaware. You won't feel guilty for it.",Mon Jan 28 13:37:18 -0800 2013,Sat Feb 16 06:42:04 -0800 2013,Sat Feb 16 06:42:04 -0800 2013,Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 -0800 2013,1,0

 I can accept cliffhangers, but this goes beyond cliffhanger. For a good cliffhanger, I need to feel some hope, or satisfaction or resolution. 
 I would have sworn I was missing pages or something. 
 The relationship developments between Daemon and Katy did make me happy overall. Getting to know Dawson was also enjoyable. 
 Katy's choice to not tell Daemon about Blake also ticked me off, because it undermined their new, trusting, mature relationship. 
 Several consistency problems also really annoyed me. Daemon put the opal on a necklace, but then it was in her pocket, then it was around her neck. This was a key detail, and it didn't flow consistently.

 I adored Ash in this book more than in any of the others.

 You know how when you see drama unfolding, or supposedly smart people doing stupid things, sometimes you just can't help but watch? 
 Or, when you secretly hope people will get their act together because you almost thing they deserve better than they are getting? 
 Or even when you truly and honestly do not like someone, and you watch just to see if they will spiral even more out of control? 
 Beautiful Disaster was all of those things for me. I hated the main character. Sure, there were times when I almost liked her. There were times when I felt compassion for her. But I despised her self indulgent choices. Having a past doesn't give anyone an excuse to treat people the way she did. 
 And the male lead? I liked him more than her even though he was definitely a volatile fuse waiting to blow. But him I could get. He had a temper problem, lots of people do. Did he go overboard a bit, yes but many people do exactly that. And if it was a book about two average, sane, ordinary people would anyone really want to read it? 
 Still, even with hating the characters and knowing while I was reading that I hated them, I could not stop reading. It held my attention from start to finish and I read it in one sitting. It was positively addicting. 
 The writing was good. Sure a few areas could have been tightened, but nothing jarred me out of the story. I cried a few times, caring about those awful people, so it definitely reached through and made me invested in them, which was a bit surprising considering how much I truly didn't like them.

 Allow me to explain. It gripped me from the first page. I read it in a day, I was very captivated by it, and really wanted to see what happened. In that sense, I loved it. 
 Much of the book takes place in Desi's head. On one hand, I have to say that Desi's voice was strong, and well developed. On the other hand, her head is a wild place to be. She is very repetitive, thinks the same things a lot - ""I was the devil's daughter..."" Yup got it. Don't need to hear it thought over and over. 
 She frequently feels the need to justify her behavior and thoughts and feelings by reminding us just who she is. And that was where my hate came in. By halfway in, I knew the character pretty well, I didn't need all the constant extra explaining. 
 The pace was fantastic. It moved fast and never got dull or boring. 
 The editing was clean. A few small formatting issues - extra spaces. But absolutely nothing that interfered with readability. 
 This book, all in all, is an example of a self published title well done. The cover is breathtaking, and the interior design is done very well too. 
 But then we come to the end. I don't mind cliffhangers - to some extent. This one though, left me feeling very unsatisfied. I fully expect the first book in a series to leave me with questions and wanting more. This though, left me feeling like ""what was the point?"" 
 From one standpoint, I can see that the conclusion was more in her emotional journey, and that part was at least a bit satisfying. 
 I really believe that a cliffhanger, done well, should at least leave a character and by proxy the reader, on a high note. - This book failed to deliver that. 
 If it weren't for the ending, I would have likely given 4 stars, even if the repeated thoughts did get a bit annoying, so you may like this book better than I did if cliffhangers don't bother you. 
 I haven't made up my mind yet if I will get the sequel. It's my understanding that as of right now, the 3rd book isn't out yet, and I suspect the second book will be just as much of a cliffhanger from the reviews I have read on it.

With that said, this product I believe is intended for children 10 and up. I have an almost 9 year old who is a very advanced reader and I do not believe this would be an appropriate book for her. Way to much on the romance side of things regarding Fang Dylan and Max. 
 With that out of the way, while I would worry about how appropriate it was for a young audience, I personally really enjoyed it. This book is great closure. I love that in the end I was not left with a plethora of unanswered questions. One of the biggest reveals for me was the identity of The Voice, and I am so happy this was included. 
 Max stayed true to character. She showed her continued softening, but never lost her ability to lead. She remains a strong heroine, which is very welcome. She wasn't quite as headstrong and stubborn as she has been in the past, there is definite character growth where she is concerned. Her choice of priorities in the end was admirable and believable, and really helped sell me on the story. 
 At times I did think it was a bit to cliche, injuries were just to inconsequential, answers were a little to easy, but it is after all a children's book. 
 The pacing was fantastic. The length did leave a bit to be desired, but again, I am an adult reader. I don't think the length would have annoyed me as much had the last 13% of the product not been a preview of a different book.

 The cover is fantastic, the editing is acceptably good - only a few minor typos. 
 The plot was cohesive, POV was easy to follow and the characters and the plot itself kept me interested.

And for Gray and even her Mom to have no realized the chocolates were the cause? Also really stupid. 
 The mother was not a believable character. What mother that loves her daughter to the point she tries to resurrect her would allow Charlene to dictate what classes they take, how they keep their hair, sleeping around, everything. 
 Taking the mother's character and turn her into a super loyal but misguided best friend and maybe she would be believable, but that woman was in no way a parent.

 Not only was it a quick, gripping and easy read the plot was believable - the characters acted appropriately and it was often downright funny. I will never be able to go to the bathroom while camping again without cracking up. I laughed, I cried, and laughed some more. 
 My absolute favorite thing was Jayne, the protagonist. She did not simply accept things. She did not make stupid mistakes just to further the plot, she resisted, she fought and she has a great smart sassy funny kick-butt attitude. I really enjoyed reading through her perspective. 
 The cover is great, the editing inside the novel is very professional and well done. I had zero complaints in that regard. 
 The plot was unique as well as well developed. I am not exactly sure what I was expecting when I first started this book, but what I discovered left me pleasantly surprised and delighted. 
 I look forward to reading more in the series, and will be purchasing them soon. 
 I have been trying to think of anything negative that I should include in the review, but really the only thing would be that it does end on a cliffhanger, but not an unreasonable one.

I have a few complaints which I will share in a moment, however first I want to make it abundantly clear that all in all this book leans toward the positive side of the scale. I liked it enough that I will probably snag the sequel when it comes out. 
 What I disliked: I found several ( atleast four or five) typos - little things like two periods, backwards quotation marks, etc as well as a few inconsistent issues - again small things. One of our characters was described in memory as having laughed at our main character, clinging onto the sidelines wanting to be a part of things - i didn't really feel like her best friend would have said that. At another point she tells a teacher she will stop by and see the school counselor, while internally saying she has no intentions of going. Suddenly the next morning she goes immediately to the counselors office? A good round of editing honestly should have caught these mistakes, but they were small enough that while they distracted me enough to be annoyed, I could keep going and ultimately i was glad that I did. 
 Speaking only to the first half of the book I felt that plot points that were dropped often felt forced and didn't flow as well as they could have. She freaks out that Evan is actually looking at her, but by everything that had been described so far shes a bit of a spectacle at the school so while I understood where and why the author was going with the tidbit, it didn't feel natural. I think it would have made more sense if he'd been looking at her in a way that suggested he wanted to talk to her, which understandably would have confused her. 
 What I did like: Everything else not listed above. The second half of the book was a giant improvement over the first half as far as plot went. Where before it had felt forced here it felt just right. The pacing overall was great, the first half set us up to know and like the characters and want to see them succeed, and i did. The second half was a whirlwind of a good ride. The author definitely nailed the art of pacing a good story and making us want to continue reading dead on. At no point did I want to give up on the book, even though during the first half I really wasn't entirely loving it. 
 I also need to touch on the cover. While i love the breathtaking cover I am not sure that it totally fits the book. If i could have, I would have given this book 3 1/2 stars. With a solid edit and a bit of tightening up the first half to be as well written and as captivating as the second half it could easily be 4 1/2. 
 In conclusion, pick up this book, keep with it through the first half and enjoy the rest of the ride.",Fri Jun 08 08:15:46 -0700 2012,Sat Jun 09 05:24:34 -0700 2012,Sat Jun 09 05:24:34 -0700 2012,Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 -0700 2012,0,0

 Much has been made of the varying responses to Helen Simonson's sophomore novel, following Major Pettigrew's Last Stand. It has been stated in some reviews that those who have read her debut do not like this book, and that those who have not read it do. In my case, I have not read Simonson's previous work, and struggled mightily to make it through this one. I am reminded of what was consistently emphasized as the cardinal rule of successful writing when I was a student, which was, 'Narrow your topic.' Simonson's attempt to address nearly every social issue of the early 20th century has resulted in too many characters, many of whom are either poorly developed or stereotypes; a lack of focus that caused the novel to drag at times and lose direction; and - despite so many, many words - plot points that are significant but glossed over superficially. 
 Last, I am mystified by the title of this book. Given that Britain declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914, the summer before the war was rather brief. John Kent arrives home with the news that the war will begin the following day on page 110.

From the beginning, this one seemed different in a way that I, initially, couldn't pinpoint. Certainly, an author can write a book that doesn't come together as well as her previous ones, but I have strong suspicions that this title was actually written earlier in Gudenkauf's career. The prose is stilted and amateurish compared to her other works, the characters are undeveloped, the plot thin and simplistic.

From the intensity of focus on the Amish residents in Burkholder's jurisdiction - who are known as gentle people who value family and community, and who are strictly adherent to their religious beliefs - to the frequency of major crimes in a small town to the staffing of the small Police Department, the reader is asked to avoid thinking very hard (if at all) in order to accept the premises on which these stories are based. 
 For example, Painter's Mill PD employs 4 full-time officers and 1 part-timer, and 3 dispatchers. Questions come to my inquiring mind: Who fills in for the 6 shifts per week when the dispatchers are off-duty? This is never addressed, or even mentioned. Neither is the fact that the PT officer, being in his mid-70s, is generally given very routine and low-key assignments, and does not fill in for the full-timers. Again, not enough coverage for any week, let alone ones in which manpower needs are heightened. Yet there is never a problem convening the entire force within 30-60 minutes any time the Chief decides a briefing is necessary. Nor is there ever a lack of response by a particular officer when she finds herself in need of immediate back-up. Do these officers never have a day off AND never sleep? 
 Serious crimes in this small town happen far too frequently - every few months at times, a minimum of twice a year - which seems to be a function of how often Castillo needs to address the progression of the Chief's relationship. Unfortunately, the crime/mystery credibility factor suffers. 
 I am also beginning to wonder about the reason for Castillo's focus on the Amish community. Seven books into the series, the Amish have sometimes been crime victims but far too often, have been the villains. This is wholly inconsistent with reality. I am beginning to wonder why the author has chosen the setting and community she has, as it seems ill-suited to the stories she wishes to tell. Is there any autobiographical component involved? Chief Burkholder was raised in an Amish family but didn't fit in with the strict Ordnung and left the Plain life. Those who leave are looked down upon and are banned from fraternizing with those who remain, including one's own family. Might Castillo have a personal ax to grind? I have no idea, but I do know that - just as Amish women are not allowed to think for themselves and are subject to first their father's, and then their husband's, decisions, without questioning - Castillo is asking her readers to accept her series without questioning. 
 There are so many ways this series could broaden, which would easily remedy all of these discrepancies.

 It's so incredibly beautiful. A true work of art. It dealt with the issue of teenage depression and suicide in such a delicate and cautious manner. I don't think I've ever read a story/novel that dealt with this issue so well before. Kakeru has a wonderful support system in the form of his friends. 
 And Suwa.... you beautiful, beautiful man. Incredibly strong character to be willing to give up his future family for a friend. What a lovely person. 
 One of the elements I appreciated most in the story was how saving Kareku was a slow gradual process with many setbacks. Depression isn't cured by one act of kindness or happiness, it is a monster that needs to be constantly kept at bay. Often the characters would do something wonderful for their friend that would alleviate the darkness but would find him regressing the next day into that pit again. That is something I profoundly appreciated because that's how it truly is with depression. (view spoiler)[ Ultimately, the choice to live was Kareku, when he became aware of how his suicide would impact others and was 'afraid' to lose his life, for the very first time. The choice to live IS your own to make and no one person or event will magically change someone's mind. I really loved that that was addressed. Also, at the very end, Naho comments on how fighting off the 'sadness' will be an everyday struggle, which is very true. Very delicate handling of the issue. Truly appreciated. (hide spoiler)] 
 My only criticism stems from the fact that, despite the noble intentions of his friends, suicide is a medical disorder that can't just be brushed aside with 'good memories' or encouragement. Treating this conditions requires professionals and medication, which goes beyond the scope of what teenagers can accomplish. It's not really their fault. This is just something that goes way beyond what they can offer. And I had to suspend my need for realism in order to enjoy this story. 
 Despite that, it IS a wonderful story and it has made me cry so much, I can't even tell you. It will definitely stay with me forever.

The writing is good but it felt everything was designed in a way to elicit sadness and tears out of the reader and it just didn't work for me.

 Well researched, spooky and entertaining. The book sheds light on a dark era of humanity through the eyes of a strong-willed and intelligent 16 year old girl. It also offers a glimpse of the physical and psychological effects of war on soldiers, as well as the general psyche of the populace during that awful time. How fear and paranoia were palpable in the streets and homes, how that fear led to a desperate yearning for spiritualism and superstition.

 I liked this book but there are things that took away from it, in my opinion. It's a good book, but it had several issues. 
 First off, I wasn't annoyed by Mal as many people were. He wanted Alina to reach her potential and did everything he could to aid her in her quest. He's a good guy. I mean, their relationship bored me ( God, did it bore me) but they loved each other so whatever. 
 One of the issues for me was that this was a continent heavily plagued by war and that was such an important theme in this story but it was just brushed away. Being orphans was very central to who Alina and Mal and emphasis was placed on how many had died in these endless fruitless wars but in the end, not even a glimpse of how this issue would possibly be resolved was given. Instead, they just housed more orphans ( REALLY???) 
 ""No land, no life. Just a uniform and a gun."" 
 Maybe I just expected more from Alina. I guess I wanted her to want to fix it, become queen maybe but she chose to distance herself from it all. I respect the fact that wanting to make the world a better place just is not on everyone's agenda, I do respect that, but Alina showed such fire and initiative numerous times, she went on and on about how she was a force to be reckoned with so you just kinda expect more from her. I wanted to see Daenerys shine through but she just fizzled out. 
 She stated numerous times that she loved her power and she loved being stronger but in the end, she reverted back to who she was before any of this happened. It just saddened me. 
 One of the biggest themes of the Darkling's campaign is the need to end the wars that have ravaged Ravka. He went about it all wrong, of course, but it would have a lot more interesting to see both Alina and him 'rule as equals' as he stated. To have Alina temper his ruthlessness, create a balance. Or really, just for her to rule alone. Set things right herself after killing the Darkling. 
 On the plus side, the scenes were she visits the Darkling are so incredible and one the major highlights of this book. But seriousy, the ending the Darkling got was just right. In some ways, it was what he needed. 
 I felt bored in some portions but overall, I was always curious to see what would happen. Plus, I really loved all the secondary characters ( Bahgra in particular) and the scenes with Nickolai were always a treat, as expected. 
 It's a good book. I just get the feel of missed opportunities. Of greater story lines that could've been had but were neglected. Of the potential for this to have been a great book. It just.... saddened me.",Wed Oct 14 15:59:16 -0700 2015,Thu Oct 15 02:29:51 -0700 2015,,,0,0

Seeing Alina come into her own as a leader, own her power and the command it gives her but still struggle with inexperience, never quite knowing who to trust, was very well written. She grew, still had her insecurities, but wasn't the mess that she was in book 1. Also, the fear of how her power would corrupt her was very intriguing. 
 I understood why Mal felt the way he did but it was still hard not to resent him for holding Alina back. I felt sorry for him but he really impeded her progress. I really loved her taking charge, wanted the struggles of seizing and maintaining power explored but that was eclipsed by her troubled relationship with Mal. 
 And, oh my God, what a treat Nickolai was! I loved every one of his dialogues and his presence definitely charms the reader. I wish there were stories centered around him and his adventures alone. I would read every single one.

 This book completely destroyed me. 
 I work in healthcare and sometimes deal with MS and quadriplegic patients. Seeing their struggles first-hand, you can't help but imagine yourself in their shoes. And while I'd argue to the grave that their lives are anything but meaningless, and nothing would make me happier than seeing them succeed and achieve happiness, knowing myself as I do, that I could never be half as brave as they are, euthanasia would definitely present itself in my mind. 
 Anyway, this book is not for the faint of heart but it is most definitely a worth-while read.",Thu Aug 27 07:16:59 -0700 2015,Sat Jan 16 12:57:40 -0800 2016,,,0,0

 I enjoyed this story immensely. Everything from the characters to the killer to the 1920s slang was so enchanting. The killing scenes were so creepy, they kept me up at night. One gripe though, a very minor one, was that it was a little predictable. Especially towards the end. But other than it, a truly riveting read.

This story is supposed to be based on Russia, or at least had elements from it, but the only thing Russian about it were the names of characters. I had such high hopes of exploring a new land and culture and the novel really disappointed me in that aspect. The world just was not fleshed out enough. 
 Also, the main character was so obsessed with looks, it got on my nerves often. Plus, she found out she had this great gift that could save many lives, she plucked out of poverty and placed in such a luxurious world, so much was given to her but all she did was complain about things. She would make a lot of mistakes and then spend a lot of time angsting about them. She wasn't a bad character, just very frustrating at times. 
 A lot of these issues had already been raised in other reviews but anyway, I did enjoy this story. It just left a lot to be desired. Or maybe I had high hopes.

 This book had many issues but there was plenty to love as well. I loved Meira and Sir, both as separate individuals but also their relationship with each other. The world building is really good and the story did hold my attention a majority of the time. The Winterian camp scene was particularly poignant and you completely sympathize with the plight of the Winterians. Angra was truly evil and sadistic, characterized in way most YA authors shy from when it comes to their villians. 
 Now on to the negatives . 
 The writing was too lengthy and Meira just overthinks every single thing and that just inspired a lot of boredom on my part. She went over the same thoughts over and over, even when she was in the midst of some life threatening scenarios. Furthermore, as much as I liked the characters, I just couldn't connect to them. Save maybe for Meira but not a whole lot either. Also, I absolutely hated the fact that there was a love triangle at all. It was completely unnecessary. 
 This book wasn't the most original or riveting story I've ever read but it was a really good book, nonetheless. It definitely deserves a read.",Thu Jul 30 07:55:58 -0700 2015,Mon Dec 21 00:48:30 -0800 2015,Mon Dec 21 00:48:30 -0800 2015,,0,0

 I thought this book was fantastic, probably my favourite in the series. Kestrel and Arin have changed so much since the first book. Their relationship was stripped down to its bare bones which forced them to build it back up from scratch on a solid foundation of honesty, trust and mutual respect. It was a necessary pain, in my opinion. 
 I really identified with Kestrel here. Getting betrayed by one of the most important people in your life and the subsequent desire to punish them whilst still loving them dearly resonated. It was devastating for her father to essentially send her to her death like that. Going by the last two books, it seemed like he cherished her more than anything else and it really broke my heart when their relationship deteriorated. 
 I really loved the battle scenes and all the scheming and strategizing done by both Kestrel and Arin. 
 The fact that they both had an 'inner voice' ( For Kestrel, her father's voice and for Arin, the God of death) that guided them in their time of panic or distress was brilliant. 
 I hope Marie Rutkoski writes more books. I'd love to read more of her stories.",Wed Jul 29 09:33:46 -0700 2015,Tue Nov 22 22:53:31 -0800 2016,Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 -0800 2016,,0,0

 Two gleaming, sad, pristine stories about loss and healing. They're written with a lot of sentiment, which translates into beauty sometimes and corniness at other times.

What got me about this book in the series was not the scandal, or the rise of this queen or that princess... it was the religious persecution and the severity of consequences of heresy and treason. In a religiously stable country with strict laws it would be difficult, but over the span of a few monarchs here, the approved religion changed with every turn of the crown. Heretics in Mary's reign were tortured and burned at the stake left and right. To live in that kind of fear and uncertainty would be terrifying. It really makes me appreciate the freedoms we do truly have here in the US. 
 This is my third book by this author about the Tudor court and I am fascinated by the era and this woman's ability to write these stories rooted in truth but which read like pure fiction.

Their ways of thinking and the day to day life are so far from how it is now, that the idea that these stories are based on reality is more intriguing than if it was all made up. Granted, it is historical FICTION so the author added drama and her own touches, but both books of hers I have read, I've researched the nonfiction part of it afterward. The amount of research the author had to do, and then having to write within such historical constraints must have been really difficult.

 Or perhaps the same magic that ran the circus in this book is transcending dimensions, and I too am enchanted. 
 Regardless of if I am spellbound or not, this book, in my opinion, deserves 5 solid stars. The author has created a magical story, with complex characters and relationships, a mysterious storyline from various points of view that weaves through the years, moving forward and backward as needed. This is all skillfully done with beautiful prose that reveals only what is needed at that time. 
 I must admit that I was confused early on. Not so much that I didn't understand what was going on, but I had to keep checking previous chapters to see if I'd missed something. Now that I've finished, I see that the author was dropping mysterious details to foreshadow things to be revealed later. There are questions that don't get answered until the last chapter even, questions that I had been asking since the very beginning. 
 The summary of things in this book is this: Celia and Marco have grown up unusually, being trained in magic and illusion by their mentors in preparation for a competition, or a ""game"" as it is often referred to. Both become key players in a mysterious circus. They meet, and later realize they are each other's opponent in a game where, unbeknown to either of them, only one will be left standing at the end. A slow-building romance blossoms, which only raises the stakes. But when they are prepared to leave the circus, they find out there is far more at stake than just their well-being; there is a harmful domino effect that could reach everyone around them. 
 The writing is luscious and rich, and somehow it still continues to move at a quick pace. Again, must be the magic. And the romance.... perfect. It was beautiful and painful, and somehow incredibly tangible, and just as electric as it is described in the book. 
 To say I am left enchanted and captivated is probably an understatement, but it will have to suffice while I swim around in the magical fog of story that I just finished.

I pictured the same song and dance; Aria and Peregrine longing for one another as they travelled about the land, all the while trying to find a way to get to Talon. Well, there was definitely some travelling. And a lot of longing. But luckily, the author moved things in a different direction. 
 Things are tense among Perry's tribe; he's taken over as blood lord, and the aether storms are making life harder every single day. Nearly everyone questions his ability to lead the tribe, and arriving with a Dweller at his side only makes it worse. Tensions are high, and there is a lot at stake, but both Aria and Perry need to find the Still Blue for different yet related reasons. 
 I loved the time shown in the beginning with the tribe and Aria's arrival. This could have been an icky, mushy, love-above-all type of scenario, gagging us with it's immense impossibility in such desperate and troubled times. But the characters are so well rooted in the story and avoid falling into the usual YA trap that some authors feel they need to explore, thinking that's what readers want. All of the characters realize that survival is key, and though love plays a strong part, it is also tested, especially when (view spoiler)[Aria and Roar take off to find Sable, blood lord of the Horns tribe. Perry's tribe faces nearly disabling fracturing within it, leaving the members starving and desperate. (hide spoiler)] 
 New characters appear, and some characters leave us. If I didn't have a job, or kids, or a real life, I would have not put this book down after opening it, I loved it so much.

 I'm always so nervous looking at the recommendations in the YA genre, because most of the time, this is the book I end up with: 
 ""Sixteen year old what's-her-face is just an ordinary girl. But suddenly, crazy and catastrophic things happen to her, leaving her to team up with an uber-hot guy to save the world."" 
 Gag. Gag. Double gag. 
 But... every now and then something will catch my eye and make it through my filters without causing me to heave up my lunch. This one had been on my recommendations for quite some time, my eyes always skirting over the rather blah cover. But browsing the online store on my nook, I noticed this one was only about $2. What the hell, it's used-bookstore cheap, right? 
 I hit the jackpot. 
 This book reaches beyond its YA label. The girl is, in fact, seventeen. and this is is technically a post-apocalyptic/dystopian setting. And there is, in fact, romance between said girl and a hot guy. All of these ingredients here have combined so many other times to make awful stories. Compare it to the authors baking cookies and using wrong amounts of ingredients. Usually, they put far too many scoops of insta-love right off the bat. Too many dashes of poorly thought out worlds and expired cliches, and you've got some nasty cookies. 
 Many times the authors aren't really following the recipe the right way. Here, people, is an author doing it right. 
 Just enough world-building to allow your imagination to soar and visualize things. I love the Aether here, even though there were no explanations as to what it actually was. 
 The story line is good. The main characters are on a quest for things very important to them, but they know their place in the world, and there is no attempt by the author to force them into a hero for all mankind. 
 My favorite part of this book is that I thought it was sci-fi/fantasy YA fiction.... turned out this is really a romance in disguise. But not a bad disguise. The romance moved along at exactly the pace necessary. I could feel the tension and I thoroughly enjoyed the perfectly-paced buildup. While all the love is sorting itself out, the sci-fi elements and plot fit in neatly like puzzle pieces. 
 So it's late, and I need to be done writing this, so I'll just basically saw this in summary: 
 This is probably my favorite love story after Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett in Pride & Prejudice. With awesome Aether storms, pods, smarteyes, enhanced senses, and quests for loved ones.

Not even ""young adult"", which I have a hard time admitting that I enjoy sometimes. Nope, this series was ""juvenile fiction"". 
 And there are definite elements that read as juvenile. I cannot rate against them since I am not the target audience here, but it was meant for a younger crowd. The lead character is 11 years old, and the writing is even more simply done than in THG. But the story is great. Her writing is skilled, though simple.

And for most of the book, I was prepared to clap and sing praises for it and give it five stars plus. Alas, Bitterblue suffered from a lagging midsection. It is not a terrible affliction, as I still eagerly turned pages, but it felt liked everything slowed down at a point about halfway through, and then instead of climbing back upward to an exciting climax, it was more of a gentle uphill journey. 
 Don't get me wrong, I still found it thoroughly enjoyable. The characters are so well fleshed out, and she has a knack for keeping relationships between people suspenseful (sometimes painfully so). I think the plot itself could have used a little oomph. 
 And there were some secrets revealed that made me cringe and feel for certain characters. I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of Fire now. Overall, I found the book to have a well thought out world and history, with three-dimensional and beautifully flawed characters... a great companion book to Graceling.

 The concept of the book is entirely unoriginal and seems to have been molded around M. Night Shamalamawhatever's ""The Village"". While the rest of the world seemed to hate that movie, I liked the idea and enjoyed the movie pretty much. I got that vibe while reading this book and I could have lived with--and even enjoyed--this book in all its unoriginal glory. 
 BUT.... 
 The author managed to create the most unlikeable character ever in this novel, and lucky for us readers, it was our boring, whiney, bipolar, selfish, stupid protagonist, Mary. There are so many things terribly painful about this book, that I'm sure they've already been written in reviews before, but I have to touch on a few. 
 1. Point of View. The author didn't do anyone any favors by writing in first person present point of view. Instead of an entertaining story, we get pages and pages and pages of what's going on inside Mary's head. First person present can work extremely well, but there wasn't enough actually going on in the story, so instead, we get front row seats to the spectacle that is Mary's inner thoughts. And all this chick thinks about is Travis, the ocean, her mother, and other things masked as philosophical ponderings. 
 2. Mary is a psycho. This chick has issues. First of all, dumb as rocks and though she constantly wonders what is outside the fence and what life used to hold, she is completely oblivious to things around her. She is the most selfish protagonist I've ever seen (and I heard people call Katniss selfish... they should check this hot mess out!). All she thought about was Travis and the ocean, and was either hurting those people around her who've been there for her since childhood, or putting everyone in danger all the time just so she could have her way. I found it impossible to root for her, and it broke my heart to find out that the series continues, because it means she won't die at the end. 
 3. Love/obsession triangle. This is not love. This is insanity, low self-esteem, bipolar mood swings, and a complete disregard for anything resembling respect. Her connection to these guys since childhood should have formed a stronger bond with them, especially since the population is so small, but there appears to be no strong connection between anyone here. Harry and Travis are brothers, and yet they show zero loyalty to one another, and betray the other without even thinking twice. Mary's confusing obsession with Travis is sickening, something like infatuation, but so up and down I'm wondering where her medications are. Her ""friendship"" with Cass supposedly went back many many years, and yet she has no shame in her actions with Travis. In one sentence, she's describing how she can't live without Travis, and the next she's fuming over the sight of Cass and Harry, and then she's livid over Cass and Travis... and it never stops. This chick has major issues. This girl represents everything that I want my daughter to NOT become. I may even use this book as an example of a pathetic and embarrassing excuse for a woman (and lead character!). 
 4. Everything else. It just was terrible. I was pretty invested even up until about halfway, and had this book at around 3 stars, despite Mary's character flaws. I liked the concept enough. And to the author's credit, her writing in terms of sentence structure and flow was actually not bad. But then it all went terribly downhill. 
 Towards the end of the book I was really hoping that Jed would get Cass and Jacob out and safe. Cass had an epiphany at the end and I liked her mothering instincts actually. That is about the only thing believable and likeable about this book. 
 I skimmed the last 20 pages or so of the book since I was nodding off, and found myself jumping with joy when I finally closed the book and could say I was done. I have never read Twilight, but after watching the movies, I see a similarity in pathetic characteristic between Bella and this Mary chick. I don't want to read or see pathetic. It's disgusting and uninteresting. I won't be reading the others, and I am going to immediately pick up something else and try and flush this waste of time out of my brain.",Tue Jun 11 23:29:53 -0700 2013,Thu Jun 13 23:34:41 -0700 2013,Thu Jun 13 00:00:00 -0700 2013,Tue Jun 11 00:00:00 -0700 2013,1,0

 The Hunger Games, but with only one tribute vs. the entire rest of the f*$%ed up world. 
 Ben Richards' entire future depends on him winning the free-vee show ""The Running Man"". He is unfiltered, unapologetic, and cynical to the max. I've never read a Stephen King book before, and if this is what they are all like, then I should read them more often. His writing style is amazing. I loved The Hunger Games more than I should, but King's style of writing blows my beloved YA obsession out of the water. One of my favorite lines from the book: 
 ""The apartment was haunted by the ghost of long-departed cabbage."" 
 I saw the ending coming, but it's what I wanted to happen, so I was ok with it. I was rooting for Ben Richards the whole time, liking his desperate and unforgiving character. 
 THIS is how a dystopian novel should feel. Dark. Hopeless. And hopeful. I'm considering my next book very carefully.

 To say I was pleasantly surprised by this book would be an understatement. From the very first page, I was sucked into this futuristic, and fairly believable, world the author has created for us. The tagline on the back cover is this: 
 ""A gritty, high-stakes adventure set in a futuristic world where oil is scarce, but loyalty is scarcer..."" 
 That pretty much sums it all up. Nailer is a boy working for the light crews on the old shipwrecks, scrounging copper and other valuable salvage for a pathetic wage. The conditions are horrible to work in, his (and everyone else's) employment is always hanging on the line, and he never quite knows who he can trust. Throw in a horribly abusive father, and you've got a kid that is clinging to the Fates that he'll get out of the life he's in. After a ""city killer"" hurricane, Nailer and his one true friend Pima find a fancy-pants clipper ship wrecked out of sight. They rescue a girl from the ship, and find she's worth more money than they can even imagine, being the daughter of a big-time company that runs some of the trades. 
 For a moment, luck is on his side, and he and his friend have found the girl who will change their lives, worth a substantial reward... enough to change his life for the better. But of course, things don't always go as planned.... 
 I found the writing in the book captured me in a way that only The Hunger Games has been able to do. Maggie Stiefvater, author of The Scorpio Races put it perfectly in her review of the book by calling it ""invisible prose"". And it is just that. You don't feel like you're reading words in a book, but instead the story is just happening around you. I was captured and the only thing stopping me from reading this in its entirety the first night I had it was the fact that I'd had four hours of sleep each night for the last week, and still had to get up for work in the morning. 
 The characters were well fleshed-out. I was terrified of Richard Lopez and his amphetamine-induced rages. I loved Tool and his odd loyalty to no one in particular. Nita wasn't a floozy like many other pretty girls in books. Nailer wasn't overcome with her beauty and rendered incapable of operating normally. In fact, their relationship (or lack of) was incredibly refreshing in the typical sea of crap instalove in many books. He saw her as his meal ticket, and only his morals as a human being softened his determination in getting paid. Of course, he gets to know her better, spends time with her, and a little attachment grows. But a good attachment. 
 The world was vivid and the author's method of writing painted it effortlessly, balancing action, dialogue, description, flashbacks, and inner thoughts perfectly to create a well-rounded novel. 
 There were a lot of kick-ass girls in this book too! Not one woman in this story was weak or dependent upon men. 
 Even though the book is technically YA, it read as an older YA book (thankfully!). There was swearing. There was violence. There was drug use. And even though Nailer was only about 15, he acted much older, which I'd expect in his world. The prose I believe was the only thing that could give away the fact that this isn't an adult novel. 
 What kept me from a 5-star rating though? Somewhere a little after halfway, the story started to drag a little. There were a lot of boats, and there was a lot of working, and a lot of well-written action, but it lacked a little bit in some interesting down time. Never lacking so much that I was in danger of losing interest, but I guess I was craving just a smidge of the typical romance that I usually criticize. 
 I've heard there were other books to this series... after this review I'm definitely looking for them! And considering this was the author's first YA book, I will seek out his adult novels as well.

 From the first page, I was hooked. It's a page turner for sure, and the chapters in the beginning with Cassie wandering about alone and flashing back to the other waves, were vivid and emotional. I was engrossed in the story, and picturing myself in her shoes, watching the planes fall from the sky. Imagining loved ones bleeding to death. Wondering how, if I'd lived through that, I would make it or if I would even want to live. Her story was grim, and I was left with this impression of a badass chick who has managed to survive, even though there were times that she would have probably rather died. 
 Cassie is badass. And I love Zombie, even though he's not so badass. He's got likeable traits though. 
 Cue Evan Walker. I'm not so sure what to think of him. Well, not him so much as what he does to Cassie. Suddenly badass Cassie turns into googly-eyed teenage girl. Granted, if I were in a ""safe"" place with a gorgeous guy with who knows how much time to live, I'd probably sneak in a little bit of smoochy time too. But the effect on the story is a little jarring to me. Her shift in character throws off the momentum, and I didn't like it. For some of the middle of the book, I'm left asking, ""where is Cassie the badass?"" I was longing to read more of Zombie's chapters so Cassie would have time to snap out of it and get back into the unstoppable girl on a mission to save her brother. It was alluded to in her chapters in the middle, but in between kisses. 
 That was the thing that kept me from giving 5. Even though Evan's story, and her story, and their connection all made sense in regards to the plot, I couldn't help but feel emotionally detached a little bit. He was too clingy too fast, she became too soft at the wrong times. I've rewritten this review several times, simply because I cannot put it into words quite right. Something just didn't feel right during the middle, in their time together. And (view spoiler)[I'm not sure what it was, but their dialogue in discussing him being a Silencer was... well... just off. The way Evan and Cassie interacted, the way they spoke, and their weird little cross-brain communication was just... awkward. Parts of their ""love"" I would have a hard time believing, and other times it felt right. Again, hard to put into words. These strange moments in YA fiction are the ones that have me desperately seeking more ""adult"" novels. (hide spoiler)] It wasn't until she finally took off to the base when I felt like I had my badass Cassie back. 
 And when badass Cassie came back, I got my badass story back. I really enjoyed the first 1/3 of the book, and the last 1/3, but the middle sagged ever so slightly in a book that I had waited and waited for. I liked the last bit. I really liked it. Except one thing. 
 Why does YA feel compelled to throw in a love triangle???? Seriously, the last few paragraphs had me pissed. (view spoiler)[The only love connection between Ben and Cassie exists in her head. Her crush on him. There was no mention of him liking her, and that kiss at the end made me cringe. Why? Why? Not necessary. They can have a friendship, and Cassie can even have a crush still, but as far as I know, Ben's got the hots for Ringer, and there is no foundation for a kiss at the end. I want Evan back. (hide spoiler)] 
 I will definitely read the next one. If you want a sci-fi twist on YA, this is a well-written and refreshing story in a sea of cookie cutter novels. For the most part, it feels more grown up than others, with more depth and critical thinking opportunities than some of its fellow YA books.",Mon Feb 25 12:19:22 -0800 2013,Fri May 17 01:14:14 -0700 2013,Fri May 17 01:14:14 -0700 2013,Sun May 12 00:00:00 -0700 2013,2,0

 Perhaps I need to read Jane Austen books back to back, so I don't lose the ""groove"" that it takes me a while to get into when reading them. I have to make my brain work a little harder at the elegant writing style (since there is nothing modern that even compares), and it takes a few chapters to get used to it. Then I have to make sure that I have all my characters and their backstories straight. By the time the last half of the novel comes around, I am really into it. Then I look back after it's finished and think, ""wow that was a great book!"", even though early on I'm thinking ""oh boy, am I ever going to make it through this?"" 
 So the story itself was good, but not as good as either Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility. By the end I was totally connected to Anne and her emotions, and could despise the snobbery surrounding her just as if it was surrounding me. The effects of persuasion in the book are obviously the reason for the title, and that theme was heavy throughout, which I loved. Anne's character drove me crazy for the first half of the book, because I saw her as a weak and easily manipulated person. Very uninteresting to me to watch someone else sit back and live life so passively. Then, like a flip of a switch, I noticed her character take on more self-confidence. I found the other characters more interesting and lively than she was, and felt as if she was a mere observer of life around her. I could understand and pity her and Wentworth because who hasn't been a situation where they wonder what if? But her character was so timid and in the shadows compared to others, I wondered if I wasn't just reading a sad story about a girl who lost her love and then watched him from afar, eight years later, court other women all while she pines in silence. Wasn't working for me. 
 But then something shifted, and I can't tell if it was a shift in the actually story and it was when the author decided to really kick things up, or if it was my issues with getting ""into"" and Austen novel. Either way, I enjoyed the last half of the book immensely. I couldn't put it down without wanting to immediately pick it back up. 
 The scenes in Lyme were interesting and action packed, and the scenes in bath were wonderful because you got to see a lot of character emerge not only from Anne herself, but from her father, sister, Lady Russell and Mr. Elliot. 
 However, the story didn't match up to P&P or S&S. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite. I think because from the start of that book you have more tension between the lovers-to-be. There is a lot of backstory between Anne and Wentworth, but their interaction is very limited so it doesn't have the tension that P&P has from the start. It isn't until the last quarter of the book that Anne and Frederick really get into good dialogue.",Mon Jan 28 12:58:00 -0800 2013,Tue Mar 12 13:05:28 -0700 2013,Mon Mar 11 00:00:00 -0700 2013,Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 -0800 2013,0,0

 Well, to sum it up, it felt forced. I sensed, after reading Insurgent, that a third book was pushing it. I was happy with where Insurgent left off, and I could easily fill in the blanks with my own conclusions. 
 That being said, there was a glimmer of something great in Allegiant. The explanation given early on in the book about why the cities and factions were in existence strengthened the premise laid out for us in the first and second books. Granted, it is still a rather unbelievable one, but hey, I don't read YA dystopian fiction for its plausibility. The back story that the Bureau gave reinforced Divergent, and I think actually made me appreciate it more. 
 Kudos. 
 Many people were distraught over the ending. I purposely avoided reading reviews like they were the plague, since I didn't want something to be spoiled, but I could tell by everyone's reaction that something big was going to happen. And something big did, in fact, occur. The buildup to it, however, was sloppy and it all happened so quickly that I didn't quite realize what was happening until the next chapter started. 
 I'm okay with the ending though. Honestly. Just as in Mockingjay of The Hunger Games trilogy, not everything ends up finishing up in a pretty package. To me it makes it that much better. But, that being said, I found the journey there to be boring. The big stuff was revealed early on, and the rest in the middle was filler, giving us all-too-familiar scenes of sneaking around, lover's quarrels, and makeout sessions. Throw in the quite unbelievable plotting and execution of plans, and you've got a story that shouldn't have really happened. Or I should say, a book that was unnecessary. 
 Great reveal early on, terribly sagging and repetitive middle, and a satisfactory and unpredictable ending.

 Immediately I was taken by the point of view. It is written from a ""we"" standpoint instead of ""I"", even though it is told from one person's perspective. The way the dystopian world is, in this story, men and women are raised from birth to forget that they are individual, and that everything is done for the greater good which is all other brothers and sisters. The people are raised without desire for their own selfish needs and feelings, and the population is very drone-like and seems to be lacking in intelligence and humanity. The people come across as robots almost, set on autopilot, doing only what is willed of them by the Council. Everyone accepts their fate, because no one is valued over another, even if we as readers can put value on one occupation or set of circumstances over another. 
 It took a chapter for me to get into it, because it was a lot of explaining of how the world is and how things are done. You don't really get a sense of whether the point of view character is one person or several until later on, when there are actions being described that can only be done by one person rather than many. Once I got past that first, even second chapter, and the lead character began to question his part in society, did things really get interesting. 
 Some things are a little far-fetched, but what dystopian doesn't have something like that in them? The thing that makes this story good is not the plot, not the character, but the ideas behind why the character is doing what he's doing. Gives you food for thought I guess. 
 The author was exposed to many wrong-doings in her childhood, having grown up in Russia in the early 1900's. Her and her family suffered many losses at the hands of the government, in the form of property, freedoms, and nearly their lives as well. All of these things helped to form her interesting philosophy called ""objectivism"", which is very obvious in her writing in this book. It makes me curious to try to read The Fountainhead again, which I gave up on in high school after I found it to be boring compared to books like Brave New World and Lord of the Flies.

The themes in it are good things to ponder, but the delivery was either too preachy or too boring. The book had its moments of clarity but was slowly paced, even being as short as it was. I didn't quite buy into the memory transfer thing, or the idea that these people didn't know colors or music, since it seemed a little supernatural or far-fetched within the limits of believability set by the earlier parts of the story.

 The second book met my expectations. 
 This book didn't ever need to be written. 
 Ever. 
 This book is horrible. 
 This is an example of a third book of a trilogy that just didn't need to happen. A book that was written, seemingly, just to finish off a trilogy. The first book, considering the subject matter, was actually a fun read. It is no literary masterpiece, but an exciting 500+ pages. The second one rambled a little in spots, but overall I enjoyed it considering I didn't have anything better to read. 
 But where do I begin with this one? The story was all over the map. It was apparent that the author knew the series had to end, and even perhaps knew HOW she wanted the series to end, but getting there was a sloppy, repetitive, boring bunch of nonsense. The steamy scenes that made the first book such a hit were so overdone at this point in the game that I skimmed through them for anything different from the previous steamy scene, stopping only if there was something new and fresh (which wasn't often). And the rest of the book was filled with Ana's and Christian's fights/temper tantrums. I couldn't even make it through the messy epilogue. She could have gotten rid of a lot of the ""fluff"" earlier on and used chapters to make jumps in time, leaving a little more room for some of the stuff at the end. 
 The whole book followed a pattern similar to this: 
 Ana ""disobeyed"" Christian, Christian punished her, they have makeup sex 
 Over, and over and over again throughout the book. That would be alright if the author would change up her wording! Each scene sounds exactly the same as the previous scene. I rolled my eyes every time I read any of the following: ""He's really, really mad"", ""Oh"", ""I feel my belly clench"", ""we find our release together""... and honestly the number of times they referred to each other as Mr. and Mrs. Grey was unnatural. But then again, they are a strange couple. There entire relationship is unhealthy and it's disturbing to think that people really think sex is going to cure everything, but that is my own personal opinion. Of course, it's fiction, so I can't really argue much there. I will just stay away from books like this in the future.

 Our Mr. Grey gets a little soft in this one. Not soft in a bad way (or in a way that sounds like I'm trying for a clever pun). You learn more of who he is and why he is this way. I enjoyed his backstory actually, and I loved the moments where he was totally and completely vulnerable and open. It made me wish he was here with me.... even moreso than the first book. Too bad Ana was too whiny, stubborn, and blind to see things most of the time. Honestly if I could slap her I would. Her character is very immature and inconsistent at times. Very hot and cold. One minute she's begging him for info and the next she's fuming over that very info she asked for. She drove me crazy in many parts. 
 The book kind of gets repetitive though. Aside from a few exceptionally steamy encounters, the hot scenes all sound the same. The author uses the same sets of words to describe them (as she does in much of the book) which takes away from the excitement. Luckily there is a decent plot as well. I found myself skimming through many of the sex scenes to get to the interesting stuff. 
 The ending was rather predictable and mellow, and I imagine the last book is going to go much in the same way. Fun read overall.",Fri Sep 07 14:24:00 -0700 2012,Mon Dec 10 23:30:20 -0800 2012,Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 -0800 2012,Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 -0800 2012,0,0

 It was good. I read it rather quickly which is a plus. The depth of research was amazing. Whether the author researched the right things or twisted things to fit his story... well I don't know. If I just look at it like a fictional novel then this was some pretty intense stuff. If I start walking around thinking that I've just learned the entire history of the church and Jesus and Mary Magdalene, then someone please slap me. 
 People, it's a book. A thought provoking tale based on ideas and theories and possibly truth. I don't know for sure, and I'm surely not going to debate with someone whether this book was genius or if it was blaspheming in every way possible. Basically I enjoyed it, it created a little intellectual stirring, and that's it. The writing wasn't great but I can forgive that along with the cheesy dialogue and predictable storyline.

Well, Mr. Christian Grey has exceeded my expectations! There is something about this book... perhaps the naughty part that I am almost ashamed to have even read. Perhaps it is the underlying romance that is rather believable and touching. All I know is that I really enjoyed this book. 
 There is an exciting, dark, forbidden element to it, which alone, isn't enough to make me like it. What is great about this is that I got wrapped up in being there, with Christian Grey, and I can understand all the emotions that this girl is going through. I won't comment on the physical aspect... not necessary. Being a female though, and having loved and lost people that I was entirely conflicted with is a very familiar thing I can relate to. I totally understood the hesitation she had, the passion she felt, the confusion and frustration about the situation, which if you read the synopsis then you already know about it and I don't have to summarize. 
 Many people slammed the book for being poorly written, but I don't think so. The author writes simply and in first person present, and does a good job of drawing you in, which is part of why I was able to read it so quickly. That being said, there are a lot of strange words that seemed as if they were pulled directly out of a thesaurus, many repetitive phrases that I could see getting old (""holy crap"", ""oh"", ""he hitched his breath"", ""I flushed""), and the whole inner goddess and subconscious thing was right on the line of being annoying. But the scenes were all described quite well and very vividly, which if you're reading this book then you should appreciate it. If you are uptight or against this type of book then you shouldn't be reading it anyway, in my opinion. 
 Like I said, I didn't expect to enjoy this book nearly as much as I did. I can't wait to start the second one... this one was left in quite the emotional cliffhanger.",Wed Sep 05 20:45:04 -0700 2012,Sun Sep 09 17:11:10 -0700 2012,Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 -0700 2012,Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 -0700 2012,0,0

 I had to push through this to give a review, and it was not the author's fault. This just isn't my type of book I guess. It wasn't written poorly at all, and the story made sense and it would be a fun book I suppose if I was in high school or middle school, but I'm not. I probably should've passed on it in the first place, but since I read it I will review it. 
 Personally I found it shallow and predictable, but it suits the genre and subject matter. I usually prefer books with a little more substance to them. If you like drama, high school, and all that jazz then you'll probably love this. It kind of reminded me of the Sweet Valley High books that I read when I was younger.

 Dystopias are some of my favorite types of books. YA is a hit or miss with me. This book had me gagging at the main character's pathetic lack of self esteem. Everything is very cliche and predictable, and I can't tell you how many times I skimmed I pages, just searching for some interesting dialogue. I didn't care for the narration style, which sloppily wove backstory and inner dialogue together, often stalling the story and putting me to sleep.

But I have to be honest here about the book. 
 The GOOD: 
 1. The story concept was good. Not fantastic, but refreshing. 
 2. It was a quick read, and despite the negative feedback I will list below, it was a page turner and easy to get through. 
 3. I enjoyed Christopher Lyon. He was my favorite character, though he needed some polishing. 
 The NOT-SO-GOOD: 
 1. The dialogue was clumsy, cheesy, and forced. I don't know if the author was trying to go for a college feel with the way they talked, but it was very unnatural and read more as early high school talk. 
 2. I couldn't get attached to the characters. Their backstories could have been woven in much better instead of a rambling narration. I never really got to know who any of them were because they all had the same voice and manner. 
 3. There were a lot of show-don't-tell violations. 
 4. The foreshadowing seemed too much at times, and mixed with #3 above, the story was flat. 
 5. I don't think the point of view did any justice to the story. It would have been fun to have alternation first person POV between Gabriel and Christopher. Taylor was really only secondary to the angels and demons in my opinion. 
 6. My biggest problem was the characters acting petty and shallow in times where they should be concerned, scared, or emotional. During the battle scenes I couldn't enjoy them because I was caught up in wondering why they were talking about love and getting back to school. 
 I read that this was the author's first book published, and in knowing that I have a lot of respect and can only encourage him to keep writing because I think he had a great concept in this book. 
 Overall it was a book of flaws, not in idea but in execution and developing talent. I think a good editor would have helped quite a bit. I do plan on reading Demon Evolution though, because I've heard that it is better than the first. :) 
 The author stated that this was his first book, and reading his blog was really encouraging for an aspiring writer like myself.

 I found that I enjoyed both Divergent and this book so much more the second time around. I'm not quite sure why. I love rereading books I love, because the second time you pick up on little details you didn't catch the first time. I really am in love with Four's character. And though the Tris-Four relationship was exhausting at times, and very frustrating, I had to picture myself as a girl whose world is crumbling around her, with family and friends being killed and never knowing who to trust. Then the relationship fits in a lot better. To want to curl up in Four's arms and disappear is not that unnatural of a thought, even in the midst of a crisis, because the poor girl is only sixteen years old! I would want to do the same thing. I loved it even more this time around, and I can't wait to read the third book and the short stories about Four! 
 **Original Review 
 This book is a roller coaster ride with twists you can't see coming! I didn't think I would be able to find a book (in the modern era... not talking about classics here) that could match my love for The Hunger Games. I'm still hesitant to say it does. But it is at least worthy of the 5 star rating. 
 Divergent was good. Great even. It started off a little too YA for me, but soon developed, ""grew up"" if you will, into the dystopian novel I wanted to read. 
 Insurgent was action packed. It had twists in it. You didn't expect certain things to happen. And they were things that were well done. Not just twists tossed in to throw you off, but twists that made sense. 
 The underlying themes are not new, but they are still powerful. Dystopian lovers read this genre for a reason. Not for the teenage romance, not for the happy ending.... but for thought provoking situations in a world gone terribly wrong. There are situations that make you weigh decisions in ethics and morals and inspire you to consider human nature and power and peace and war. 
 I loved Divergent, but this second one in the series really captured me. I'm finally able to stop thinking about Katniss and Panem and those thought provoking scenes. I have a new series, thanks to this amazing debut from the author, to also ponder on. 
 There will be those who criticize it and hate it for what it is, but I guarantee there will be so many more who love it!",Thu Jul 05 22:55:02 -0700 2012,Fri Sep 13 22:33:22 -0700 2013,Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 -0800 2013,Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 -0800 2012,1,0

The premise behind it, though an unlikely scenario, had many thought provoking scenes and ideas. I could identify with Offred, not because I felt similar to her but because the author has done an extremely good job with emotional flashbacks and creating a sense of helplessness that was convincing and disturbing. 
 That being said this was not a light read. I found it went quickly but the tone of the whole story is utterly dark. Depressing, helpless, sad, angering. But I liked it for some reason. 
 The author wrote very poetically at times, which was a nice contrast to many of the more modern books that seem devoid of that artistic element of writing.

 This post-apocalyptic tale of Deuce, a girl raised in the underground tunnels of the College enclave, is a fresh breath in my eyes. I don't read a lot of post-apocalyptic novels, so the world-building was interesting and fun. I was able to picture myself in those dark and dank tunnels, fighting Freaks and coming across relics of the past. I thought the author did a decent job of showing that these people in the enclaves know little to nothing of the way life used to be. They had to adapt, and kudos to the author for getting me hooked into that mindset. 
 I liked the characters. Deuce is a killing machine, yet still a girl. Fade reminded me a little of Four in Divergent. Stalker was intriguing, but in a disturbing way, since his first introduction to us was as a ruthless Wolf, who treated girls as he pleased. His character did change though, in what I felt was a believable way when he had to team up with Deuce, Fade, and Tegan. It was nice to have Tegan there too, as a secondary character. 
 The love triangle that would normally bother me, doesn't. Like in The Hunger Games, how Katniss and Peeta found a way to love each other through survival, I feel a similar connection with Fade and Deuce. A little rushed, maybe, but not petty or insta-love. And then there is Stalker, who was handled well in the triangle, in my opinion. Over time spent stuck together, he grew attracted to her, and made his move, which I felt Deuce reacted to in a pretty realistic way. Thank goodness. 
 My criticism would probably have to be that the story seemed to suffer from being too short. Another 100 pages could have really helped with creating better character connections within the enclave itself. As is, some of the relating between the people within it was awkward. The relationships, between friends and brats, leaders and followers, seemed forced at times, and the secondary characters were not fully fleshed out. At one point during a celebration, the actions and dialogue seemed immature, and inconsistent with the people previously described as having to grow up fast and serious, given their short life span and dire circumstances. Too carefree for the situation. 
 Oh, and they run A LOT. In the dark. Weird. They seem to run all the time. And talk while running. Seems hard to do, but whatever. 
 Once Deuce and Fade left the enclave, I was relieved to see the character development return, and some exciting things happen. 
 Until they stop happening. After that point, it seems the characters wander a lot, avoid the wolves, wander some more, fight some Freaks, wander some more, fight some more freaks... all with a little bit of the love triangle tension simmering under the surface. Not a lot happened. 
 BUT, that being said, I enjoyed it. It is a good read. I wish the author would have just written a little more and filled in some gaps. I'll read the next one and see where it goes.",Tue Jun 19 00:39:54 -0700 2012,Mon May 27 00:19:41 -0700 2013,Sun May 26 00:00:00 -0700 2013,Wed May 22 00:00:00 -0700 2013,0,0

The premise of disassembling a person against their will for the greater good was both entirely unrealistic and incredibly intriguing. Somehow, it worked. Brilliantly. 
 The first bit of the book I found myself teetering on disbelief. But something kept pulling me back, keeping me on that fine line of buying the idea. In this future world the Heartland War decided that abortion is illegal and inhumane (though ""storking"" was ok...) but at the age of reason in the teenage years, a parent or guardian can sign a form and have their troublesome child taken away to be unwound. Each part of the body to be used for a good cause. An accident victim who lost their leg can now walk. A blind woman can now see. Even the brain can be fixed. Somewhere inside I find this a ridiculous idea. An unrealistic one that could never be possible in the world I know. But there it is, that little thing that kept me going in the book, with me never having to feign interest. 
 I don't remember the exact point where my disbelief was entirely suspended. Somewhere in the safe houses maybe. Maybe it's when I read about the baby. Not sure. Doesn't matter. 
 This story became more and more chilling and even though these were teens, they weren't immature or shallow. No, they had to grow up. 
 Things that I specifically loved about this book: 
 1. The shifting points-of-view. I've never read a book with so many. And it worked. 
 2. The relationships. There is no love triangle here. There really isn't any romance. Risa and Connor have their moments, but I bought them along with the premise. Even the relationships just between the Unwinds. The interactions and dialogue were done very well, and the backstories and character actions were in sync with one another. 
 3. The Clappers. I just loved this concept of dangerous blood. 
 4. Chapter 61. I won't even describe it. I can't. I can't even say I loved it. But it disturbed me. Horrified me. Brought me to inexplicable tears. Chapter 61. That's all I have to say. 
 My complaints are few. Actually, just one. Though I loved the multiple points-of-view, I wasn't as keen on the vantage point. I loved the switching of lead characters, but almost hated that it was 3rd person. I don't know why the author did it like that, and caught myself in each chapter thinking how much more powerful the 1st person would have been. The 3rd person worked well for the ""outside"" character chapters such as Clappers, Mob, or Guard, but when it focused on the main peeps I longed to be truly in their head and to see through their eyes. 
 I ended up buying the idea the story was built on, but I can see others not being pulled back from that edge, and falling into disbelief. If you can't buy the idea, this book won't work for you. I bought it, and I'm haunted. This book was horribly good, frighteningly entertaining in that subtle way.",Sat Jun 16 01:13:34 -0700 2012,Fri May 10 00:45:44 -0700 2013,Fri May 10 00:45:44 -0700 2013,Sat May 04 00:00:00 -0700 2013,0,0

The story itself is fine, but sometimes books with a religious undertone (or obvious tone, in this case) can be hard to read. I enjoy finding moral and religious aspects in books, even ones that are not labeled as Christian or religious, but when I go into a read knowing it is written with those things embedded in it... well I just have a hard time allowing myself to take in the story itself. I often feel as if I'm being lectured in a homily at church, with a meaninful parable being stuffed down my throat. It doesn't mean I don't agree with the message, it just means I take things in on my own terms. 
 I recommend this book for those of strong faith and who can find God's word in any situation, no matter how dark it may be. Also for those who may have been through something terrible, and need a story written about facing feelings and emotions in tragedy.",Fri Jun 15 14:31:58 -0700 2012,Mon Oct 01 23:06:07 -0700 2012,Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2009,,1,0

 I'd call this a light fantasy. The world is very similar to ours in a sense, with humans and animals and a seemingly normal world around them with the same seasons and landscapes. The Graced, people with extraordinary abilities in a certain skill, are what set the world apart from ours. It's a primitive, medieval-type lifestyle, pretty common in many of the fantasies I've read. This story is about Katsa, a king's niece, who possesses the Grace of killing. 
 But it doesn't read too much like a fantasy novel. I've encountered books hundreds of pages long with tedious descriptions and world-building. This book had the perfect amount of both, and though some criticized the author's world-building, I found I didn't need all of the extras to make it work. 
 The author writes very well and rather simply. Her style allows you to flow through the chapters effortlessly as if you are experiencing them firsthand, which makes for a quick read. I read this in about 6 hours total reading time. That's always a bonus! 
 But the stars of this magical novel are truly the characters. I'm a fan of strong women leads, not because I'm a feminist, but because they are interesting characters to read about. No one wants a boring, whiney, wimpy chick leading the way. And Katsa is probably my favorite female lead EVER. Which is a lot to say, because if you know me then you know I am a huge Hunger Games fan and pretty much wish I could meet Katniss for real. I think Katsa actually topped Katniss (there must be something with ""Kat"" names) in that she felt her purpose and moved along with the story intentionally, rather than survived her ordeal. I'm not downing Katniss by the way, because she was an amazing survivor in her story, but that's how incredible Katsa is. 
 She is Graced with the ability to kill. And she does. But, she's not a ruthless, cold-blooded girl, which could have easily been the direction the author went. Instead, she gives Katsa realistic weaknesses and vulnerabilities, such as the developing ability to control her temper and standing up to her uncle, King Randa, when he wants her to perform his dirty deeds in the kingdom. She's not unkind or foul, but rather a product of her upbringing, and I love the complexity to her character. 
 Po is wonderful also. He seems a little soft, but he's also very strong. He is Graced with the ability to fight, and when Po and Katsa meet, they have some incredibly charged interactions. He's intuitive and sensitive to others, yet brave, strong, and level headed. 
 The supporting characters are well rounded, and I fell in love with Raffin and Oll and Bitterblue. 
 I love when a book feels believable. Not in the sense of that it could actually happen, but that the characters are fleshed out and consistent enough that their dialogue, actions, and interactions seem so natural that it would appear they were modeled from real people. This book has a little romance in it, but I LOVED it. I liked Katniss and Peeta also, but again, I think that Katsa and Po are just that much more electrifying. No insta-love here people, it's a well developed and heartfelt bond shared. 
 And the secrets about their Graces... great revelations. Po has a secret, and Katsa discovers her true Grace. Together, this team is unstoppable, and it made for a truly exciting read. 
 If I absolutely had to find something to gripe about, it would be the travelling. They did a lot of it. It sagged a little in the middle, but the sag was pretty well supported with great character building and more world-building, plus development of relationships between characters. 
 The author was criticized by some for Katsa's character and the depiction of her as a woman in the story. I don't see what the fuss was about, and I'm not even sure why she was picked on about it. I guess some people have more extreme feminist views when it comes to how a woman should or shouldn't be portrayed in a story. Personally, Katsa is incredibly strong and independent. Maybe it was her decision to (view spoiler)[**gasp** have sex with Po. Just because she wasn't married, and never wants to, the author was criticized. I've seen far worse things exploited in books (Lolita, anyone?), and if you want to get into YA examples of weak or ""bad example"" lead characters, check out The Forest of Hands and Teeth, or Twilight (hide spoiler)]. Katsa is great. I'll let the haters hate I guess, and just keep rooting her on myself. I wonder who the Katsa's critics root for. 
 This is a book I will read again. I'm so glad I bought a hard copy of it, because I will read it over and over. And recommend it to everyone I know. I am still thinking about this book and about how this review doesn't do it justice whatsoever. Katsa and Po... just wonderful.

 Had this book been 150 pages shorter, It would have gone more quickly. Unnecessary details would have been spared, a few flashbacks shortened and maybe even a few characters may not have survived the cut. But despite my belief that a quicker pace would have made this story that much more readable, I think ultimately the tale and the author's beautiful writing style would have been unfairly clipped and not allowed to blossom into their full potential. 
 Kate Morton's writing is superb. Her use of language and structure both within sentences and the overall telling of the story is amazingly intricate and it is obvious she has all of her details worked out. The storylines from 1900, 1908, 1913, 1976, and 2005 all dance with each other, meticulously interwoven and revealing just the amount of information necessary to push you on to the next chapter. 
 I can't say there was a big surprise or incredible shocking reveal. Actually, I could see each ""mystery"" unfold quite easily. +But instead of ruining the suspense, I was actually quite satisfied, like when you finally finish putting together a puzzle. You see the picture on the box and have all the pieces in front of you, but it still is a rewarding accomplishment to put everything together. 
 The beginning of the book is slow. Rather slow, and a little hard to get into, but the things in those chapters definitely tie in to the later chapters. About halfway it starts really picking up, and it becomes hard to put down. I especially loved seeing things from Rose's mother's point of view, and from Eliza's as well. Cassandra was a little dull, but the majority of the characters are wonderfully crafted. I see a common theme in Kate's Morton's books... the family histories spanning time, odd and unfortunate characters, and a subdued protagonist. 
 If you enjoy well written books, and don't mind spending time reading beautiful prose, then give this book a try.

It is written well and easy to read. But it is not a light read, despite the talking animals and simple prose. It is a parable, and as always in parables there is a lesson. 
 I'm sure the political background of this book has been talked to death by people who have far more insightful things to say, so I won't break into a discussion of comparisons between this story and what it was based on. To me, it showed people's natural handling of power. The animals wanting to break free from the hardships and injustice of the human farmer, so they rebel. All is well with new leadership, until there is disagreement and suddenly the pigs turn on one another. Power becomes the ultimate prize, and propaganda and lies and other forms of manipulation trick a blind and stupid barnyard into following without question. The few who know better keep their mouths shut to avoid stirring up trouble. And even the hardest working and more devoted animal in the barnyard falls victim to the leadership, loyalty meaning nothing. 
 This could be many governments in many countries. I sort of see parallels to what is happening in my own, with empty promises and blind followers, those who know better either to scared to speak or eliminated as a threat to those in power. I am not a political person, but you don't have to be to see the message in this book. 
 This wasn't a sit-down-and-read-a-fun-book kind of story. It is dark. It is classified as fiction yet eerily its message is anything but fiction. Now I see why it's a classic.

This series goes from a dark dystopian novel with potential for happily ever after and transforms over the three books into a haunting, heavy, dark, mind-boggling story of war and the effects of it. I cried again and again. I don't even need to list examples because they are littered throughout the book. One on top of another. I have not ever been through something that has left me with PTSD, but from what I can see, the author has not only done her research on things, but they hold a place in her heart and the passion is poured into her writing, into her wonderful and tragic characters. And the ending. I still think it's perfect. Everyone is where they could be expected to be given the circumstances. Not where we'd like them to be, necessarily, but where they could be if this was a real story based on real people coping with terrible, terrible things. I wish everyone could read this. 
 Original Review 
 Nothing in this book went the way I thought it would, but I absolutely loved everything about it. Some people hated the ending, but I found it a perfectly suitable finish to the story. There is no happily ever after in the traditional sense, but the ending is very bittersweet. I cried over Peeta in this book like a little baby, and after the ending I cried some more. 
 The way that the author has brought Katniss to life haunts me, because it is as if I was actually living as her, thinking every thought that she thought, feeling everything that she did. Simple language, short sentences, and even broken sentences helped with the style and feel of the book which some people critique. 
 The beauty in this series is the characters and the story that they are in. You are able to forget that you are reading a book because it flows so well. 
 **Update** 
 I just finished reading this for a second time, and even though I knew what was going to happen I still couldn't put it down. The disintegration of the characters' well being really had me emotional this time around, and I still cried like a baby at the end.",Wed Jun 06 13:07:30 -0700 2012,Fri Mar 29 01:41:17 -0700 2013,Sun Apr 01 00:00:00 -0700 2012,,3,0

 I still think this is my favorite of the three. There is so much going on, and in the last half of the book is when you really, really get the sense that there is something more going on. It's when the story begins turning darker and more disturbingly realistic, emotionally. The first book was a brilliant concept, paced perfectly with a very fitting and exciting end. This second book is like a bunch of tremors in the earth before a volcano blows. The characters grow, and you're introduced to new characters that add so much to the story. Then the last third of the book is when everything starts to really rumble, before exploding at last and introducing you to the traumatic and chaotic preview of Mockingjay. I am now dying to start a re-read of that one as well, but have promised to actually continue reading DaVinci Code.... This Hunger Games series just really blows my mind and keeps it spinning for weeks. 
 The Hunger Games was amazing, but this book was just as incredible. It matches the intensity of the first and you have the added bonus of learning so much about the other characters in the story too. It was in this book that Peeta and Katniss became almost real for me, and the ending left me so frazzled that I had to begin the third book that night!",Wed Jun 06 13:07:27 -0700 2012,Tue Mar 26 13:21:21 -0700 2013,Sun Apr 01 00:00:00 -0700 2012,,0,0

This was just that, once you got through the heartbreaking retelling of the hospital events. But the author was not very skilled at putting words together, and his exclamations of ""I nearly fell out of my chair"" (paraphrasing of course) came too often and it got old. But, it's not about the author, it's about the boy, and his wonderful trip to heaven. I want to believe it is true, and I am going to do just that, because I know miracles happen, and throughout history mysterious and wonderful things have happened to rather ordinary people and if this is his story then it is a beautiful and uplifting one. I wish people wouldn't criticize it too harshly.

 It's really short, but the writing style from the 1500's is MUCH different from ours. And I thought that Jane Austen was a challenging read!

To be honest, the first few chapters left me hesitant to continue. The book is a story about Edie in 1992, who works to uncover the secrets hidden behind the family of Raymond Blythe (the author of her favorite book growing up) and his castle from back in WWII and beyond. She digs deeper and discovers connections to her own mother and searches for answers to a whole bunch of ""who"" and ""why"" questions about Raymond Blythe's family and the mysteries surrounding the shadowy past of her mother who refuses to talk to her about it. 
 The things things that I didn't particularly care for in this book: 
 The pacing. The length was fine, but it was a slow book. If it were a movie, I would have fallen asleep. Actually I did fall asleep several times while reading this, which is why it took me two months to finish it (compared to the different-in-every-way books of The Hunger Games Trilogy that I had managed to finish in less than a week). 
 Too much detail and intertal thoughts in the chapters focused on Edie. Her actions were important and her connections to her mother were important, but I was utterly bored while reading her scenes, which obvioulsy couldn't be removed without disassembling the entire book. 
 The things I enjoyed about this book: 
 The shifting time frame. It kept things fresh and I really loved the way the story seemed to intertwine with itself over the 50 year gap in time. The book was pieced together really well, and I don't know if it was written that way, edited that way, or some combination of the two, but it was brilliant. 
 The characters. By the end of the book you have several different characters with very distinct voices, stories, and personalities. You learn to love each of them for very different reasons (except Thomas Cavill... I just didn't connect with his character.) 
 The story. If you step back and look, it is just a bunch of ordinary stories meshed together to form one plotline, but sometimes those individual stories of monsters within and secrets withheld can be more interesting than the earth-shattering story that affects everyone on the planet. 
 And finally the WRITING. It is magnificent. The author has a beautiful sense of vocabulary and a way of piecing sentences together that makes you forget at times that you are reading a book. It is like music how it flows during some descriptions. And not just narrative. She writes just as beautiful during the times of action, thought, and reflection. The descriptions of her world are woven into sentences in ways that don't sound like your traditional description. When they use the term ""show, don't tell"" when it comes to writing, the author nails it. 
 In all, it was a good read, even if slow at times, and I'm very glad to have done it. I am planning on reading her other books when I get my hands on them. I would recommend this to someone who can appreciate beautiful writing and a good story. I would not recommend this to someone who wants a lot of action.",Wed Jun 06 13:02:34 -0700 2012,Tue May 06 12:07:40 -0700 2014,Sun Jun 17 00:00:00 -0700 2012,Sun Apr 15 00:00:00 -0700 2012,0,0

 But... I had to edit my review. I was not very nice in describing my boredom with the book. Some people have problems with people giving bad reviews when the person didn't finish the book, but I think it's entirely appropriate, as long you let people know you didn't finish. Then others can skip over your review if they want. 
 People really enjoyed this book, and I bought into it. That's great if people loved it, but here are the reasons I couldn't make it past page 60: 
 1. Detached narrator. The point of view is that of Thomas, a boy who's been dropped in a place with a bunch of other boys. I expect panic, and uncertainty... and the author is telling me he's scared and panicking, but I don't feel it. It's third person, which can work, but I don't get any connection to the main character. Perhaps I could have later on if the author's writing style were different. See #2. 
 2. Too much telling, not enough showing. The author describes everything around the main character. But it's not done in a way that allows the story to flow. It's as if the story is pausing to describe the surroundings or other characters. 
 3. The slang. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I don't feel like it did. 
 4. The withholding of information. Others mentioned this in their reviews, and I couldn't agree more. Thomas is asking questions, and no one is answering. And he's not okay with that, but he goes along with it. He asks more questions, and the subject is changed. 
 I'd criticize that all the characters seem flat and sound the same, except that I do know that character development happens over the course of a book or series, and I didn't give the whole book a chance to discover if they have depth or not. I didn't find it in the first 60 pages, but I may have missed something later on. 
 When I read a book, I want it to hook me with either an interesting storyline or by introducing me to a character that I want to know more about. Calling a book good or bad is subjective, and not entirely helpful. Instead of saying it was bad, I'll just say that I didn't enjoy it enough to read it in its entirety. I couldn't connect... I was reading words on a page, rather than wearing the character's shoes. 
 I got a sort of Lord of the Flies feel while reading the little bit I managed. That book worked for me. The high average rating by so many other people on this one leaves a tiny bit of curiosity in my mind as to what happens in the story, but at this time I'm choosing not to continue, due to lack of interest. Perhaps there is a great storyline, and maybe in the future I will discover it. Is a one-star rating fair? In my opinion yes, because there was a failure to keep me reading.",Wed Jun 06 00:15:55 -0700 2012,Mon May 13 10:58:03 -0700 2013,,Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 -0800 2013,0,0

I was so amazed by the idea, regardless of how far-fetched it might be, that I read it as a fifth grader. As mentioned in my other reviews of Michael Crichton books, I enjoy the science and excitement of different situations, and in this book, I found myself wrapped up in all the dinosaur-goodness. It still is one of my favorite books today simply because of the concept. And the science seems believable, whether it is actually possible or not, and when it is believable, it is easy to get immersed in the world unfolding before you, and get the chills at the idea of a velociraptor hunting you or from hearing the distant thud of a tyrannosaurus footstep. Wonderful, just wonderful.

The relationship between Tris and Four rubbed me the wrong way initially, since it seemed to be purely physical and reeked of teenage lust, but once I saw more of Four's personality and bits of his history were revealed, I warmed up to it.

 I still can't quite put into words how this book affects me. Others have felt it too, others not so much. Suzanne Collins is a brilliant storyteller who doesn't allow fancy writing to get in the way of her story. When I'm reading, I am Katniss. Her first person POV is the best I've ever read. I can go through all the emotions that she experiences, and the situations are such that you can't help but ponder on how you would cope with being in her shoes. When I'm done with the book, I'm left empty for days, trying to come out of Panem and back into my own real world. Call it pathetic, call it crazy, whatever, but I seriously have withdrawels when finished. That's all. 
 This is one of the best stories I have ever read. The author writes simply and succinctly which allows the book to flow perfectly even in times of flashbacks or internal dialogue. the characters are what make this book so wonderful, and Katniss is so human it is amazing, because without her thoughts and insight (which seem natural and not forced), this book would just be an interesting idea with a good plot.

But once I got used to the extensive vocabulary and flowery way of speaking, I could not pull myself away from this story! 
 Such drama! We may be years and years apart but the things that are at the root of all people seem to still be the same: love and money and status. Elizabeth Bennett is an amazing character. She is so funny in a cynical and dry sense, in the way that does the things she does and speaks to those around her. All of the characters, actually, are built in a wonderful way. Each has a distinct voice and motivation, and dialogues between characters are very clever and well written. There really is no matching this story or writing. The romances between all characters is built up perfectly, with frustrating tension so real and natural.

 I adore Elizabeth Reyes and I adore her very much so. I just don't adore Sofie and Eric. All they've been are just the side, supporting characters and I never found the spark I wanted to find with them, a spark Valerie has. 
 If anything and as much as it hurts to say this, it was a bit boring, especially for the first half. I just don't want to hear their life story plus other parts of their life that overlapped with previous books. And the parts that were new and refreshing was just them arguing over silliness and I just wanted to dive into my Kindle to slap them in the face. I'm not a huge fan of reading about ""cheating"" (not so much in this case as it is in Gio) but Brandon was just the last thing I wanted to know about. 
 Of course, I did love seeing Angel and Sarah again and perhaps it's because of those two I'm having troubles aknowledging Sofie and Eric as main characters.

 Noah, hands down, was just the sweetest. Even when he didn't want to care for Vee he still involuntary did and I might have said ""Aww"" a few times at these moments.

And after reading that description, I'm actually kind of glad that I didn't get DLV until the other day or I would have gone ballistic, knowing that the next book won't be released in a year! Especially after how that ending left spazzing, WHHHY!? 
 But, NEAL? WHAT? Team Ben! Forget Adam. 
 Edit: Some minor spoilers (though the ending is so predictable, there's really nothing to spoil. But we'll cover that later.) 
 I absolutely adore you Mrs. Stolarz. So much to the point where I'm going to let this little mistake slide. Even though this is the 5th and supposedly last book to series that has drawn on for far too long, I don't feel satisfied. I can still walk around a room and have what seems like thousands of questions left with no answers. So I'm a bit disappointed in the ending. 
 First off, I understand that ""write what you know"" is what drives a ton of writers. Yet, after 5 books, it was entirely too easy to figure out from the start what had happened. The blog? Knew who it was. The lessons? We all knew who they were coming from but this time it they just felt oddly placed and didn't flow as well. The crime that had hardly any background to it as to why it occurred? Ben would save her like he always does, yada yada yada. 
 Plus, Camelia? I will always love you, but I REALLY wanted to slap you across the face for well, basically the whole entire book. You dragged it on with Adam, giving an innocent guy false belief, when you knew damn well it was over. But you don't even have time to mourn it until you run off into Ben's arm (actually more like rub his tattoo) and everything's suddenly okay! You run away to Rhode Island to ""enroll"" in some art classes, when it was all just a cover up for the girl. You disappointed Spencer and made yourself look like a fool in front of everyone (but it turns out everyone's in love with her...what was that about?). You act reckless to the point where your own best friend has to follow you and how do you repay him? You steal his keys countless times and run off on dangerous journeys, without the police and no thought that someone might actually care. I'm starting to wonder if there's any logic injected inside that head of yours. 
 And the whole crisis with Alexia? It'd be an understatement to say we're left WAAAY too much in the dark. There were so many unanswered questions formatted in the form of ""it doesn't matter"" or ""it's all for the better, honey"" that I was just ready to stop right there and throw the book at some bonfire (Okay, I'm not really that evil but we get the point, right?). 
 If there turns out to be an unexpected sixth book, I'm not a big enough to person to not gloat, ""I TOLD YOU SO!"". Although, I'm not sure if I want to see such a great series get deteriorated a bit more though with the same damn plot with different people. It's like Mockingjay all over again... 
 So let's all have a little moment of silence as we all mourn the loss of a series that started out wonderfully and just kinda crash and burned.",Sat Sep 22 22:43:05 -0700 2012,Sun Mar 10 21:28:12 -0700 2013,,,2,0

 I honestly wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this book. I've never read anything with sports being such a heavy influence. Any book I have read with a sport influence has only been about football with the occasional baseball setting thrown in. I enjoy watching the two sports but nothing to the extremes (except maybe the Cowboys...) but I definitely haven't done anything hockey related. Furthermore, I'm usually NOT a huge fan of alternating points of view (You can blame Cassandra Clare for that one). 
 So I was actually pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this book. I might have spent a little too much time reading this book in all of a few days but oh well. 
 So Shea: Can we just all agree Shea is absolutely amazing (The necklace was insanely adorable)? Other than him being whiny about Elli only all the time, I always kept wondering why he doesn't exist. However, I do have to join the Elli-hate train with all of her insecurities and I personally don't know how Shea managed to deal with her being all ""I'm not good enough for anyone!"" all the time. I get that a woman is usually never happy with herself but there's a point when it's pathetic and just looks like you want attention. Elli somehow managed to reach that point and give it a whole new meaning. Frankly, it drove me nuts half the half time and I'm glad her friends agreed. Oh and did anyone else find the whole Shea Adler obsession a bit creepy? Maybe that's just me not being accustomed to hardcore fangirling but you name your dog and have a whole him devoted to him... Grace and Harper definitely make up for Elli though. And the kids! How adorable! 
 Will I read the next book in the series?: Yes 
 Am I going to fall head over heels for the hero if he's anything like Shea(here's to hoping he is!)?: More than likely. 
 Will I complain about the heroine if she's anything like Ellie?: Damn straight.",Wed Jul 04 22:41:53 -0700 2012,Sun Jul 14 19:26:38 -0700 2013,,,0,0

 Uhh, nope. 
 I've never read a book about sirens (but I didn't even realize it was about sirens until the diary...) and I just felt like I was in the dark. I wanted to know more about the diary cause it seemed to shed some light for not only Lexi, but for the reader as well. But Lexi doesn't even question it and forgets about it. 
 Overall, I didn't find this to be much of a fantasy book with a little love like it led on to be. It turned into this one big somewhat sappy but not really love story that was just downright pathetic for me. The love triangle was a bit surprise (and unnecessary) since Erik just randomly turns up out of the blue, uninvited and poor Cole... It was just a huge drag and more like a forced read. Plus, Lexi always feeling terrible and being all ""I hate isolation but I'm choosing it anyway"" can REALLY bring a book down.",Sun Jun 17 23:40:57 -0700 2012,Sun Jun 17 23:48:02 -0700 2012,,,0,0

 I loved the idea of her getting amnesia after the wreck yet the little teaser stretches the truth a bit too much for my liking. I just hated the way that it was portrayed to us 
 Zoey, the main character, is just so...UGH! She's trying to be perfect, falls under the 'hey everyone else is doing x, I will too!' and seemed like a Mary Sue. I could not, COULD NOT, get past at how she's never had sex, has it with Brandon then believes he's her boyfriend. It's a one night stand, or really in your case, a friends with one time benefits, honey. (Plus he went and bragged about it...really?). THEN she's just dying to have sex with anyone who's someone which really ticked me off... 
 The only time Zoey really showed any potential was yelling at Doug at the final beach party. 
 Speaking of Doug, who is beyond sweet and despite the craziness that makes Zoey so easy to hate, he still wants to see she's doing alright. Which takes some serious guts, I'll hand that to him. And thankfully, he isn't one of those characters that will do anything for someone they care about and seems to be the only one with some self control here. And he really stole my heart when he did the wallet trick of 'Brandon's my boyfriend' every time Zoey mentioned. Which was all the freaking time.

 Seriously, Clare? Seriously? 
 As if COFA wasn't bad enough but you just had to make it worse, didn't you? You could have had a perfect ending with City of Glass and now I think you're just writing for the sake of having some more money come in, as if that isn't already happening with the City of Bones movie. 
 Clary. I honestly used to like you. I really did. Probably not as much as I liked (or loved) Tessa but something. Now you're just annoying me. Sure, you run off and get your little ass potentially killed! No one's going to care! Why would they? You be that whiny girl who can't be away from her boyfriend without causing World War III and see how much love you get. 
 Yeah, not so much, huh? 
 Overall, I found this book lacking plot and just seemed of Clary dwelling on if Jace would ever would be well...the Jace we all know and love. Since Clary is being the silly girl she is, there's usually Jace to be the funny one we wished would just pop out of the page and be ours. 
 But nope. Clare killed her only strong point in this book until the last few pages (cause of course everyone's gonna get their happy ending!) (view spoiler)[ And the fire thing? Really? What's the point of that happening? (hide spoiler)] 
 And I'm sure by now everyone's noticed how Clary and Jace are these one of a kind characters that are so awesome and seem to have little to no flaws. And now it just seems that every book is focusing around that and after a while it gets lame... 
 But, with the mention of Tessa earlier, it's obvious that I probably loved the Infernal Devices so I was ecstatic to see all the little references in it! Like seeing the angel and Will's copy of Tale of Two Cities and poor Alec getting jealous over Will. (though that really NEEDS to stop). 
 And naturally, despite my little personal rant, where calling it unprofessional and mature is an understatement, of course I'm going to read City of Heavenly Souls or whatever it's called. (I really missed finding out what the cities were and now I don't even think there's anything useful about the title, other than trying to maintain the theme of the first 3 books). 
 I'm BEYOND curious at how Clare going's to wrap this series up.

 I don't really like the idea of dropping a book just because it's not interesting. I wasn't even hoping for anything in this book.

 I was a fan of the series not only because the characters are enjoyable, but also the interesting and well developed plot. 
 The last of the series however, although not that disappointing, doesn't thrill me as much. I didn't like how the Piebald issues were resolved and how many others ended. Everything felt rushed. 
 The ending is well enough for me so I couldn't and I still do like it. Although I can't be certain if it's due to the influence of the previous books that made me stick to liking this last book or if I simply like it.

 It shows the human contradicting nature. 
 I don't think I hate to recap the values in it. It's been told many times. 
 A good book to read, a wonderful perspective to see from. 
 And in all, the story is alive. You cannot not live with it. 
 I guess if I have to say what I like, I wouldn't be able to say it. 
 Many times I feel that I can argue with the contents but in the end, it shoots right back at me. 
 They are not all right, nor am I all wrong.

 Still, even if this story was slow at times, it was a very awesome read and I feel nicely cocooned in the world it build.

 I thought Poison Study was fantastic and up to about half way, this book wasn't that bad but then everything changed - the characters were no longer the characters they were in the first book and had devolved rather than evolved. The premise of the first book was so good but it was almost as if the author couldn't decide what the book was to be about and the result is just a mess. Being a fan of fantasy fiction I'm happy to let a lot of things go but some if this just wasn't believable and then started to be a bit, well, cheesy. A real shame as it could have really worked.

It is exactly the same thing that ended up seriously pissing me off about the Lux books. That and anything to do with holy demon or alien babies. And that the leading female character is always too good to swear. 
 It is a good story but it is an obvious story, I would defy anyone not go have worked it all out way before the reveal at the end. The love triangle is blah.

Worried about her body to not worrying about her body. 
 There was a theme of women being oppressed and an indication that this was a bad thing yet in the very next breath the main character is lamenting that she is too overweight to fight or that she is not pretty enough. 
 The book seems to be set in the future but it reads like it was set on the past. There is no explanation as to why we went from technology to a neo-medieval world with magic. The Library has Harry Potter books which was just cringeworthy.

Why did I give this one five? Up to the last few pages I thought this was a solid four but then it tied up so well and as I thought about it there wasn't a huge amount I would change. Apart from one thing - an English lad who drinks coffee rather than tea?! What planet are you on Rachel Caine?! 
 There are a few other frustrating stereotypes that American authors always associate with the UK too but that wasn't hugely surprising. I also got the impression that Jess's family seemed more Irish than English but that's just nit picking. 
 This reminded me a lot of Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next books with the library and the Wales v England battle. Is be interested to know if Caine had read those books. 
 This book had infinitely more substance than Caine's Morganville Vampire books which although I loved were Hollyoaks compared to Ink and Bone's Breaking Bad. The writing style is rich and borrows heavily from many different civilisations - the supernatural and steampunk is beautifully and subtly intertwined. 
 I cared about the characters. Perhaps I didn't understand some of their reactions to what they witnessed but Caine had already made it clear that these kids were out for themselves. 
 This is clearly a young adult book but it has much more richness to it than others in the genre - there is a 1984 theme that can be chilling at times with the executions and inferred torture but it is more painted in your imagination than being crude. 
 You aren't hit over the head with romance or love triangles - obviously romantic relationships are there but it was more the family and friendships that interested me.

 Ok I've slept on it. I read an interview with Veronica Roth yesterday where she said that she had in mind the ending right from the beginning. I always think this is a bit of a danger as you're developing the story. I just don't think the ending was appropriate for the book -the sacrifice doesn't make sense. Had there been a theme throughout the book where it was obvious that this had to happen then I'd accept it, but the stakes didn't seem high enough for me, it was almost senseless. Where I can accept it in books like Game of Thrones, I'm not sure that the motivational messages work when you break the reader as Roth does. Maybe the novellas that follow will pad out the story but I expect these are just the publication of Roth's experiment in working on Tobias's voice.

 I'm still emotionally wrecked by this book. I'm going to have to wait to review it. 
 24/03/13 
 Where to start in reviewing such a book as this? It was five star up until the epilogue when I was rather tempted to give it a one star for copping out, but I'm assuming it sets up another story arc so I'm giving Clare the benefit of the doubt. 
 The Infernal Devices is superior to The Mortal Instruments, granted I think I've only read two of the later. The Clockwork Princess is the best of the lot. The range of emotions, the confliction and grief I felt reading this book were intense. (view spoiler)[ For some reason, I was a bit idiotic, it didn't occur to me that Jem was not dead, I thought that had been closed off completely, and I'm still not entirely convinced that Clare makes the Silent Brother transition case adequately enough. But whilst I was sad, I didn't cry at this point - I bawled my eyes out at the epilogue - Will - he's just such an epic character - and Tessa outlives him - that really hurt. And while it is nice to see Tessa and Jem together, I can't help feeling a little let down by the gigantic cop out - I guess it is hinted at by Magnus when he says 'The first is the hardest' - will Tessa live forever? What will she do when Jem properly dies? Will there be a another - vampire - cop out? I know that these books aren't supposed to be real life, but I was left with a confliction of emotions when it did end. (hide spoiler)] 
 The writing is amusing - the one liners and exchanges between Will and Gabriel 'Lightworm' amused me and I really do like the whole emphasis on poetry that Clare uses. I liked the setting of all three books, with the 19th Century restrictions on what was proper - very refreshing from the promiscuous 21st century.

I can't help thinking that the first two books should have been combined into one and that this would be the second of a trilogy. 
 It has one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever read in any book with Alex and Aiden which is just - beautiful. And for me, that's saying something, I don't do soppy. But it is perfect, for the story and the characters and probably something that makes the ending and probably the next book all the more poignant. 
 I actually highlighted some passages in this, mostly Leon centric, I loved the character and had kind of guessed the story arc there. (view spoiler)[ Bringing the Greek gods into the book was a stroke of genius, more from that please. I'd like a big fight with the Greek and Roman Gods too while we are at it. But that's off topic. I can't help thinking it was a little too easy to smite the furies and get the better of Hades - surely Hades should be kick-ass? (hide spoiler)] 
 What ruins the book for me is the Seth/Alex relationship, which I think will put me into a minority. Don't get me wrong, I like the bad boys, I like them very much, but this relationship seemed wrong on so many levels - the elixir event is unforgivable - I agree with Aiden on that. I was actually quite disturbed that Armentrout was happy to go along these lines and have Alex react the way she does - to suggest that this sort of behaviour is acceptable is awful. For a young adult novel especially, its not in anyway okay. (view spoiler)[ However tormented Seth is, I can't see how Alex can forgive or end up with him in the end. Clearly, their fusing at the end is going to to create this new relationship, which is fine, it will be interesting to see everybody else's reaction, but the only way Seth can come back from any of this is sacrificing himself or if Alex does kill him - they clearly can't both live.

I wondered if it was the character showing naivety at one point but it was poor writing. There's lots of stuff that doesn't make sense - for example, the bizarre relationship between Anna and her adopted mother which bordered on emotional blackmail and then at the end she quotes her adopted mother by saying the best way to live someone was with an open palm/let them go. Huh. The mother has kept Anna so sheltered her whole life - unless this was a recent quote it makes no sense. Had there been a scene where she'd said to Anna ""This scares the hell out of me but I know I have to let you deal with it in your own way"" it might have made more sense. 
 There's so much crying in this book - this girl would cry if you picked a daisy in front of her because you'd killed it. I suppose it makes the end confrontation slightly more believable.

 I was going to give this 3 stars all the way through and then I thought about giving it 4. In an ideal world (GOODREADS!) I'd give it 3 and a half. I like the concept but sometimes the dialogue grates me but I can see why YA readers like it. Myself, I like the concept of shadow hunters - other than that, there really isn't anything in these books which is truly unique. And I love that there is a huge element of risk in the Clary (hate the name, I change it to Clarissa when reading, it sounds.... childish) and Jace's (equally dislike the name but Jonathan doesn't suit him) relationship - that takes balls. But it isn't as grim as it might be perceived - it is actually very sympathetically explored - although the kiss in the Seelie Court could have been toned down somewhat and I'm fascinated to see how far it goes. The story is reminding me of the Secret Circle very much. Bit of a shame Simon had to vampify - I liked the idea of keeping someone mundane/human in Clarissa's life. Vampires are always cool, but it over-complicates a love triangle (or at the end of the book, a non-love triangle - Jace and Simon got more action than anyone - together - a new ship?)which was fascinating to start with. Also, why are some of the characters - eg Alec & Isabelle not openly bothered about the incest? They have their own relationship interests with Magnus and the weird fae guy respectively but in the grand scheme of things they are darn normal relationships.

 This was one bizarre book. I was shocked at the end to realise that it was written by the same person who'd written the Lux series I'd spent the weekend obsessing about - I would have never guessed that, the writing is completely different. (Although thinking about it, lots of discussion of eye colour and abs should have alerted me to this). Lux felt finished whereas this book - felt like it was a draft. Or at least, certainly the first half felt like it was a draft, and yes, it is incredibly similar to Vampire Academy although I'd argue that it isn't *as* similar. For example, Deacon/Seth clearly suck, whereas Adrian kicks ass, so let's not visit that one again. *fangirl moment* 
 It was very easy to get through, I almost read it completely in my two-way train commute and then had about 5% to finish at home. It lacked description, although thinking about it, the Lux books were similar. I can tell you a lot of the characters had hair as they were constantly putting their hands through it, and I know what colour eyes people had, but I'm less sure about anything else. 
 The story.... yes, it is very similar to VA but there are some bits that are different. I just wish some of the characters were a bit more likeable. The reason VA was so good was because you could see Rose being with Dmitri and Adrian - both were good for her, but whereas Aidan clearly is a sweetheart, Seth seems so creepy. Maybe that's the intention, but it doesn't sell it either way to me. Either make him completely venomous or nice, you can't have it in the middle - it's just....turgid. 
 I'm going to try the next book at some point to see if it does deviate from VA, as the author says it does, but I'm more looking forward to the next Lux book, truth be told.",Sat Dec 01 14:01:00 -0800 2012,Mon Feb 25 12:28:11 -0800 2013,Mon Feb 25 12:28:11 -0800 2013,Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 -0800 2013,0,0

I've heard that the second book complicates matters but if you take it as a book, I don't think that I would have been unhappy if it had just been a standalone book. 
 I like Lauren Oliver's style. Sometimes the best stories are the simple ones where everything is the same apart from one small change - in this case the fact that love is seen as a disease. And it is something I think that anyone who has fallen in love can understand. I found myself smiling tightly at the symptoms of love and the pain that comes along hand in hand with it. I think many of us have laid awake at night wishing that we could extinguish that part of us that feels so deeply. 
 That said, the concern of Lena's aunt and uncle confused me - why were they so concerned? If the guardians of someone who had the disease where dealt with harshly, maybe I could understand it, but it didn't seem that this happened - there might be the humiliation but it seemed to be quite common that under 18s would experiment 'inappropriately' - so why try and prevent someone from experiencing something when without love, you cannot possibly care about what happens to them. If they are as detached as they are meant to be, why are they bothered about Lena? Is it guilt? And here's my question - are love and guilt mutually exclusive? Why do we feel guilty? It surely must be because we love or we don't want to let people down. Very interesting philosophical questions. 
 I can't find much to fault about Lena. And I adore Alex. That boy is something special. I loved the excerpts at the beginning of each chapter - both from 'real' books and books from the world that had been created. Take it from someone with a cold dead heart - this is a beautiful book that will make your own cold dead heart try to beat again.",Sat Dec 01 07:29:06 -0800 2012,Sat Dec 01 13:46:17 -0800 2012,Sat Dec 01 13:46:17 -0800 2012,Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 -0800 2012,0,0

It isn't great but it's not that bad considering who it is aimed at. I read it quite quickly and there weren't too many occasions where the book annoyed me. Yes, there could have been more explanation and backstory but I assume that is what the next five books are about. There are plot holes but show me books that don't have them. It was never my objective when picking up this book to find the next master class novel - you just look at the blurb to know exactly what it is going to be - a tried and tested formula that works. It is escapism. And so what if it borrows themes from other books? It isn't as of there are infinite storylines in the world. I like that the author tries to introduce meanings of auras and flowers although the auras are underused in the latter half of the book - very strange considering the figure at the beginning explaining their meanings. Bottom line is, if you want to read a timeless young adult novel read Catcher in the Rye. People put standards on books that aren't intended to be anything other than what they are. I probably would have given this two and a half stars if I could but bumped up to 3 as there were so many one star reviews of it. So if you've got to the end of my rant, if you're a fan of Twilight, Fallen etc you'll probably enjoy this.

 I'm not really into summarising books as I don't think that that is what a book review should be but it is useful to briefly go through the plot: to cut a long story short, a fictional island starts to drop letters from its alphabet because the letters keep falling off a statue of the City's founder. The book is a series of letters between the inhabitants as to what transpires when the City's leaders decide to enforce this bizarre law. 
 On the one hand it is a pleasurable delve into the beauty of the English Language. I must admit that there are a number of words where the meaning escapes me but as I was reading in the car I didn't have a dictionary to check, but I will certainly re-read clinging to a dictionary. The prose was certainly very engaging. 
 There are a few rather droll aspects to the book - the most amusing when people have to change their names because of the missing letters. I feel however that it is more an ironic than comic story and you can see this with the clear theological theme/debate which runs through the story.

She's kick ass, sweet, funny and not in anyway bolshy. She's vulnerable too, which a key event early on in the book shows. I liked the story line and can see a number of areas where the series could go to. 
 I wasn't so keen on some of the linguistics - the Scottish master and Riley's father's 'partner' Beck's conversation was written in their accents (I know there's a techincal word for this - I learnt it in A-Level English Language but I've forgotten) which is something I really detest in books. The only person I think to have gotten away with it with me is Irvine Welsh because his books are a work of art. The use of 'ya' for you and 'ta' for to just annoy me - it suggests people are too stupid to remember that these characters have regional accents. However, it is easy enough to gloss over this. 
 I'm keeping my fingers crossed that there isn't going to be another love triangle/rectangle/octagon a la every single young adult paranormal book on the market these days because I really like the innocent relationship that Riley seems to have with Simon but I doubt I'm going to get my wish with all these mystery men showing up in her life.

 I wasn't sure that I would get on with it - I don't find werewolves appealing in the slightest (Team Vamp all the way - apart from Oz in Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but it was much better than I thought. People have compared this book unfavourably to Twilight - I'm not going to do that, I'm going to take it as an individual story. That said, Grace is a much more likeable character than Bella and Sam a much less creepy version of Edward. 
 For what it is, it is a pleasant enough read - it is a paranormal romance for young teens and you have to take it at that value - this is why the emo poetry thing works even though the song lyrics seem pretty disjointed. 
 I liked that the wolves changed because of the weather rather than any primal need - this was a nice touch. 
 At times the book just seemed to be waiting for something to happen - eg we went to school, we chilled in my room all week until xyz happened, but these bits went by quickly but did give the impression that they were leading a boring adult life rather than the teenage passion that they were supposed to be experiencing. That said it was a relief for the relationship not to be primal a la other paranormal romance books, it was loving, safe and sweet, and I really got the impression that they adored each other on a pure level. 
 So, overall, a nice and sweet story. Nothing stunning but certainly not as bad as some reviewers might have you believe! I'd like to read the next books to see where the story go.",Wed Jun 06 13:37:43 -0700 2012,Mon Jul 09 10:35:15 -0700 2012,Mon Jul 09 10:35:15 -0700 2012,Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 -0700 2012,1,0

Given everything I've heard about these books I thought that they would be right up my street. Maybe because I read it during my commute in the morning whilst trying not to fall asleep didn't do it justice. 
 There were clearly bits that were ironic and mildly amusing, even though they didn't really bring a grin to myself. In some places it seemed too clever. Maybe there have been authors that have taken on this style and developed it, which is maybe why I found it so.... odd. 
 And I've got to admit, I just didn't understand it. Was there a storyline? Was it just a series of events? Is this what it was supposed to be? If it was, fair enough, but I still found it very hard to follow. 
 I will probably read a couple more in the series to qualify my view, but perhaps it just isn't my cup of tea, which would be a shame!",Wed Jun 06 07:33:34 -0700 2012,Sat Nov 17 07:36:28 -0800 2012,Sat Nov 17 07:36:28 -0800 2012,Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 -0800 2012,0,3

 The backstory and history are much more robust and the characterisation is far superior, even if some points are quite laboured. For example, bizarrely even though she seems to have high emotional intelligence, has no idea Adrian is crushing on her. Even if she's immune to him in person then Jill's weird behaviour, given what she knows of spirit must be an anvil. Also it is clear from early on that Trey has another purpose than a match maker. 
 Anyway I digress. The book sets up a really interesting story arc to be explored - how far will Sydney go for example to be loyal to the alchemists or loyal to herself.

 The first book, AN UNSEEN ATTRACTION, featured the mystery, mischief and murder that befell Clem Tallyfer, bastard son of his Grace, the (late, late) Earl of Moreton as he managed a lodging house, and fell in love with Rowley Green, one of his lodgers. The second book, AN UNNATURAL VICE continues the investigation of whomever killed one of Clem's lodgers, Reverend Lugtrout, and also Clem's half-brother, Edmund, then the earl. Lawyer and journalist Nathanial Roy is working hard for Clem to ensure he doesn't get put out of his lodging house by his uncle, an mean elderly man who is claiming the title as Edmund had no legal offspring. But spiritualist Justin Lazarus met Edmund's secret wife, and knows a son was born. They spend most of their book on the run from London's killer fog, and a real-live killer, while they hunt down the rightful Earl of Moreton. 
 We already know the identity of the apparent earl by the end of the second book, and he's not what anyone expected. Pen, and his twin Greta, christened Repentance and Regret after being born in a religious sect where their mother took refuge when her scoundrel of a husband married her, had his merry way, and discarded her at the age of 16, are now performers. And Pen likes it that way. He and Greta have a good life where Pen can allow some room for his...unusual and generally unacceptable behavior. 
 See, Pen is gender dysmorphic. He's not happy in men's clothes all the time, and he's also not happy in women's clothes either. He has long, lush hair, and often paints his face to match that of Greta-and not only for their performances. There are days he can't bear to look as his naked form, and his broad, strong hands-tools of his trade-horrify him in their masculinity. In the musical hall, he can dress in ways that are counter to society's dictates and pass it off as a lark, or the eccentricity of a performer. And he likes it too much to give up for some stuffy title. There's no way he could mask his nature for the twenty-or fifty-years he'd need to as an earl. And the idea of marrying a woman to sire an heir? *Pen shudders* 
 Mark Braglewicz was born to a Polish anarchist, and endured life with only one arm. He's an enquiry agent, what you might call a private investigator in today's terms. His dear friends Clem and Nathaniel need his help tracking down the missing twins, and there's no shortage of death and destruction that follows this search. Already three men are dead, and two properties were either burned or vandalized. It's actually not hard for Mark to find Pen, nor is it hard to woo him. Pen hasn't found a man before who had such flexibility in his desires. Mark finds Pen's gender-bending appeals to him far too much, and he's in a bad spot. He's falling for Pen, but the murderer is still on the loose. It's with no other choice than to save his friends and protect Pen from the murderer that he reveals Pen to be the rightful Earl of Moreton. 
 Pen is furious at the betrayal. And he's not happy with the process of investigation. As his great-uncle and cousin dispute the situation, Pen and Greta are sent to pass the time at the family seat in the country. With their new ""relations."" It's uncomfortable, and unnerving, for Pen to be scrutinized so. Clem and his half-cousin Tim, also make the journey and they are good companions. Greta seems so happy on her walks with Tim, and Pen can't escape his title, though he desperately wants to do so. Once the lawyers finish their investigation, he'll be sealed into the title forever. And, man, is he mad with Mark for this burden! 
 Though, it wasn't Mark's fault. It was his rotten father's fault. If Pen is destined to be this earl, then he's going to make things right within this whole dysfunctional family, by golly! Well, if he lives that long. It's clear the danger didn't remain behind in London, and Pen's fears that he's being stalked are only assuaged when Mark turns up at the country estate to search for a possible killer among the house staff and visitors. And, Mark's able to win back his beloved Pen. 
 The mystery was, as in the previous books, slowly revealed and had a great twist. The open love between Mark and Pen is tender and thoughtful. I could see why both men were so conflicted. If Pen is a earl, Mark has no hope of sharing any sort of love, clandestine or not, with him. But, the story ends happy-and realistically so. Pen is a quick thinker, and when his chance appears to make his life as he sees fit, he grasps that lifeline with both his strong hands and runs like the devil chased him. This is a fantastic mystery-romance series with just the right amount of intrigue and affection and a beautifully-rendered historical setting.",Thu Oct 05 14:05:55 -0700 2017,Thu Oct 05 14:07:05 -0700 2017,Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 -0700 2017,,1,0

He's 23, virtually jobless, and just got picked up by the police, again, for making graffiti art-criminal mischief, in this case. His father, Landon, pours out his woes over Poe's aimless life to his best friend, Jericho McAslan and Jericho feels a kinship to Poe's situation. Jericho had been a handful, and far more trouble to his caregivers at a younger age than Poe is now, but he'd been given the opportunity to learn the trade of tattooing and it saved his life. Now, twenty years later, Jericho's in position to pay it forward, and offers to take Poe on as a receptionist at his tattoo parlor, with the bonus that if he is diligent Jericho will offer him an apprenticeship as a tattoo artist. 
 Poe is a little sulky about the prospect, but he soon is intrigued by the art happening all around him. And, it helps that Jericho is exactly as sexy up-close and personal as Poe had found him when Jericho would pop over for beers with his dad. In fact, Jericho thinks nothing of the age gap between them, and he's not shy of his interest. Jericho's undeniably turned on, but he's also put off by the prospect of damaging his friendship with Landon, and also with the power imbalance in their work relationship. He turns Poe away again and again, but Poe's attitude only gets worse, and he's soon in trouble again with his tagging pals-mot notably Blue. Blue wants all of Poe's attention and he's not afraid to demand it, which makes their friendship uncomfortable for the first time in years. Blue doesn't want Poe to learn how to tattoo, or to find a job where he can be supported by his art-because Blue thinks they ought to suffer for it, and it's all a little off-kilter. Poe hadn't seen how out-there Blue was until he stepped away and got perspective. He wants a good life, with a good man, and Jericho finally comprehends how good he and Poe could be together. And, it's super-duper hot, folks. The best of Daddy porn on the page. 
 I don't want to give away too much more, but I will say that Blue messes things up for Poe and Jericho big time, and it surely ties into the next book in this series. I've read a few tattoo-artist romances this summer and this ones just delightful. The age difference was fun to observe, and the relationships between Poe and his dad, Landon, and Landon and Jericho are really awesome. Landon became a father at a young age and raised Poe without help for nearly all his life. The lack of maternal coddling in their youth is a bonding point for Jericho and Poe, and the way Landon manages to not punch Jericho in the face for ""exploiting"" his boy is charming. I liked all these characters and felt like they were real enough I'd go have a beer with them anytime. I look forward to the next book where I expect Blue will get a strong lesson in adulting, and love.

 Letta is the teenaged apprentice wordsmith of Ark, a community of survivors on post-apocalytic Earth. The ice caps melted and the seas rose and John Noa built a fortified town where some of humanity would survive. Letta's parents, residents of Ark, disappeared when she was a small child, bound to search for more survivors. Letta was raised by the wordsmith, Benjamin, to treasure words, though the people of Arc are only given license to use the 500 words on their List as their language. 
 Benjamin isn't pleased when he's told to cut the List to 300 words, and Letta isn't any happier. She's in love with language, and words are her trade. She relishes knowing more words than most of Ark's residents, and does her duty to keep making List words for the school children and apprentices of Ark when Benjamin goes on an extended journey. 
 John Noa's theory that deceitful words of untrustworthy politicians destroyed the world has warped his mind, and he wants language eradicated and man to return to that of beasts, is pretty out there. Benjamin fought against him, and lost, which Letta discovers before it's too late. She meets Marlo, a ""Desecrator"" or person who creates are or music and lives in the banished forest outside of Ark. Letta helps him recover from an attack by the Ark policing agents, and his family helps her track down the fate of Benjamin, and others who'd gotten in John Noa's way. 
 This is an adventure that's filled with intrigue and peril as Letta endeavors to find truth that's been well hidden in ignorance. Her worldview is opened by her experiences with the Desecrators, and in witnessing the callousness of John Noa's agents. They banish the old and inrifm as well as the young. Their idyllic world is a shell game, and Letta's blinders have been removed. She does her best to save the day, but it's not over when it's over. Letta, Marlo and the Desecrators need to find a way to help their fellow humans find a new direction, and it'll take another book to get us there. Really interesting look at a totalitarian regime, and a censored society, from a teen's point of view, and the plot kept moving along nicely as Letta made truth her mission. 
 Looking forward to the next adventure on this journey.",Fri Sep 15 11:24:00 -0700 2017,Fri Sep 15 11:48:57 -0700 2017,Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 -0700 2017,,0,0

He grew up in a family that thrived on making tons of cash in real estate and business, but he didn't like the cut-throat, often not even legal, tactics they took to make more and more money. So, he stepped away and began rescuing dogs. 
 Over the years, he decided that opening a no-kill shelter was the best manner to his goal: more dog rescues. He even went to shelters in his area and rescued dogs tagged for destruction. A year ago, he met some strange men from Mad Creek, California; these guys helped him return all his animals from sheltering int he desert after vandals had turned the whole facility loose. Rav never forgot the experience, and he was struck by the intelligence in the eyes of some random dogs they'd brought along, including Milo. And, he sees that same spark of intelligence in Sammy, a shy chocolate lab. 
 Sammy's first life was as a chocolate lab, and it began with a great start. He loved his owner, and she loved him, but she fell down the stairs one day and he was too scared to bark for help. Her sister took Sammy in when his first owner died. But, this woman's husband was abusive and particularly hated Sammy. He hated when Sammy interfered while he was beating his wife, and he beat Sammy, too. He threatened to leave Sammy out in the snow during the winter, so she took him to a shelter. There he meets a dog who can turn into a man, one who insists Sammy will be able to do so if only he tries hard enough. Sammy isn't sure if he can, but he also recognizes that he needs to get away from this shelter before his kill date comes up. He takes careful note of his dog-man-friend's instruction on how to make it to Mad Creek and be safe. All Sammy needs to do is get adopted, however, he is terrified of large men and few families are willing to adopt him. His kill date draws lethally close. Until Rav comes along. 
 Rav tries to win Sammy's trust, but it's hard to do. Within a week, Sammy the dog goes missing. Rav's speechless when he watches surveillance footage showing Sammy open his cage, and several doors, in order to release himself from captivity. Upon activating Sammy's tracker, he follows his meandering labrador to Mad Creek, several hundred miles away. Two connections to Mad Creek in one year is too much coincidence, and Rav decides a road trip is necessary. Arriving, he cannot believe what he finds: lots and lots of doggy-acting humans. Is it magic, or science? If there's any people Rav could love, it would be these remarkable dog-people. 
 Sheriff Lance Beaufort isn't happy that Rav's deciding to stay, but the whole town is overjoyed when Rav announces he's planning to open a dog rescue in Mad Creek, and he's willing to hire members from the community as staff: firstly, Sammy. He immediately notices how many unemployed people live in Mad Creek, and how thin the financial resources are stretched. Yet, working with Sammy shows Rav how easy it is to train the ""quickened"" dogs (who appear as people because they are dog shifters) in new, but repetitive, tasks. It's first nature to them to do the same thing over and over, and it gets Rav's brain working on potential industries he might be able to bring to Mad Creek, to provide jobs for the thousands of quickened who'd never adapt sufficiently to standard jobs in an unsheltered life. 
 While Sammy is falling head over tails for Rav, Rav's doing the same with Sammy. Their relationship grows slowly, because Sammy is newly quickened and his physical body is more mature than his emotional or mental age. Plus, Sammy is still shy of large men, even in his human body. Still, being close with Rav is exciting and Sammy's pals, like Milo, help him figure out how to become a physical lover. Rav's patience and quiet love for the man-dog he'd rescued back in Arizona pays off, and Rav's experience in business brings new life to Mad Creek. I don't really want to discuss those details, because the intricate plotting is very sweet. The book is a bit of a slow burn, and has some dark moments, too. Like, Sammy's experiences of abuse, and the way the Mad Creek folks try to run Rav out of town. Expect true love to win the day, Sheriff Lance to get a new partner in caring for Mad Creek, and the quickened to find new hope and industry. It's tender adn sweet and gooey and I loved every second of it. While there's no guarantee we'll see another book in this series, I'm wishing on stars and howling at the moon for one.",Fri Sep 15 07:09:06 -0700 2017,Fri Sep 15 07:10:12 -0700 2017,Wed Sep 06 00:00:00 -0700 2017,,1,0

 Vanya Petrov survived a targeted attack in Moscow for being gay. His appeal to the UK for asylum is still under review and he suffers from PTSD though his life-threatening injuries are now healed. As a petitioner for asylum, he's unable to earn any money and must subsist on a meager welfare allowance. It's barely enough to keep him housed in a miserable hostel and fed. It's been nearly nine months of waiting, with monthly immigration check-ins, and collecting evidence that demonstrates he will be in grave danger should he return to Russia. He develops a friendship with two people at the hostel, Kaspar and Anna, and they band together against thieves and attackers. 
 Vanya meets Jason at the store where Kaspar works. Jason mistakes him for a personal shopper, and he's desperate to make himself look better in the eyes of his foster brother, Andrew. Jason's been a jerk for the past six months, ever since Andrew asked Jason to be best man at his third wedding to a much younger woman, Chantel, whom Jason is sure is a gold digger. Jason's also sure there's no such thing as true love and doesn't want to help Andrew find his way toward another divorce, but he's also unwilling to let Andrew walk out of his life. So, he attempts to hire the exotic young man he's not sure is even of legal age to help transform him from a gruff builder into someone presentable. Vanya, having been seduced into trauma before, is wary of Jason's motives for hiring him, but he's also desperate. All of their savings has been stolen and he and his friends don't feel safe living in the hostel. In fact, being near Jason-a home restorer-gives Vanya an inside track on a vacant property where they can squat in safety. 
 But being near Jason also turns on both fear and attraction, in equal measure, for Vanya. He's afraid to get caught accepting money for work, to have Jason learn where he's living, to have Jason learn he's a fraud and not a personal shopper, to not be granted asylum...there are so many worries in Vanya's precarious position as an asylum-seeker and he misses his family who have cut all ties. He's adrift, and sees that same loneliness in Jason-with whom he builds a rapport. In fact, Jason's life has been lonely, and he and Vanya unexpectedly hit it off. Vanya gives Jason good counsel about the situation with Andrew and Chantel, and Jason recognizes his instincts there have been rotten. Their camaraderie soon builds into a mutual attraction, and turns cautiously physical. Jason doesn't know much about Vanya, and what he thinks he knows is off the mark, too. So there be struggles, but there also be admiration. Jason very much admires Vanya's resiliency, his tenacity, and his willingness to help out Chantel with wedding plans pro bono. Though, when he finds out why Vanya won't take any money for his work, well, it leads to some fireworks. And, some remorse. And, some big apologies. 
 I loved the interplay between the characters. Kaspar, Anna, Andrew and Chantel are all fantastic supports to Vanya and Jason. Each man is cautious, with his heart and with his words. Jason has a problem with age differences-between himself and Vanya, and between Andrew and Chantal. It takes him a while to come around, but he's not afraid to make amends when he gets it. Vanya is an amazing character. I haven't read many stories from the POV of a desperate would-be immigrant, but this felt so very genuine, and the terror, trauma, and anxiety of that situation came through loud and clear. I ached for Vanya to find a full life in London, and with a man he could trust. Jason seems as if he can be that man, but the lies between them are large and dangerous. How they worked through this was good, though I wondered how Vanya could move on so fast to set his plans into motion. Still, the end is beautiful, and a totally happy resolution. I'd read another three books with these guys at the center, that's how much I adored this one.",Fri Sep 15 06:59:29 -0700 2017,Fri Sep 15 07:00:21 -0700 2017,Thu Sep 07 00:00:00 -0700 2017,,0,0

The artist that he seeks out, Matt Huffman, is nearly down-and-out with too many bills and too little cash, but he's compassionate and curious. Bi-curious, that is. It seems that some of Matt's recent experiences have highlighted how attracted he may subconsciously be to men. But, there's no escaping the fact that he's aroused by the terrified Navy pilot under his tattoo gun. 
 Jon's always ready for a hook-up, but nothing more. And, he's not sure why he's so inexplicably attached to Matt--especially so when Matt admits he wants some sexual experiences with an experienced man. Jon's all to happy to volunteer his sexpertise, and they build a friendship that includes smoking hot sex whenever they can manage. But, they also communicate in a friendly way, and begin to spend non-sex-related time together sharing meals and outings. Matt's nervous about coming out as bisexual, and Jon patiently stands by his side. Months go on and they are far more than friends, and really more than lovers, before Jon recognizes he's actually in a relationship. And, that's not cool with him. He'd sworn to never settle down with another man again, but is being with Matt all the time really settling? 
 I liked this one. Matt was such a tender heart, despite his bulk. Jon's compassionate, to a point. His freak out because of the '-ship' business was troubling, but I liked how he came to terms with his fears in the end, and salvaged his relationship. Matt was definitely worth it. I also enjoyed all the sexplorations and how eager Matt was to embrace his bisexuality once her mentally committed. It's clear he'd been traumatized in his youth by an overbearing, homophobic father, but his existing family is supportive, for the most part.

 Holland O'Dell is an algorithms expert who's hired in the only suitable position (for a woman) at her dream company Cody Tech: in sales. It's disheartening, but Holland's a fighter. She survived three foster homes after being abandoned shortly after birth and has cobbled together a small nucleus of friends that she considers family. She's also got a great idea for restructuring one of Cody Tech's earliest device designs, and an in with a contact at Major League Baseball. Id she can refine and sell the product, she might garner enough support to get hired into her dream position in project development. 
 Oliver ""Hale"" Cody is a young man adrift. He'd struggled with his posh life for just over a year, and went on an adventure to ""find himself"" when he thought the need for him at his own company was overblown. Cody Tech was started by his father, and everyone assumed he'd just take the reins once he finished schooling, but Oliver didn't feel like he'd earned his position as CEO. While on his journey towards himself, Oliver's parents were killed in a car wreck, and Oliver's idyll was at an end. The truth of his adoption was revealed by the attorneys of the estate, and Oliver's reeling from a sense of complete loss. Who was his true family? Not only didn't he know this big secret about himself, how could he trust his parents' decisions? His shenanigans and drunken rages have destabilized the company, and caused a major shake-up. While Oliver is mostly too distraught to care, he notices a woman, Holland, working late at the company, and admires how she doesn't take his crap. Seeing that she's working on a product he'd developed with his dad, he's intrigued, and wants to help her fine-tune it. 
 Through his repeated attempts at connecting with Holland, Oliver learns a lot about himself and his company. He learns about her childhood and feels a kinship for lost familial connections. He learns his company has a long way to go to overcome the ingrained misogyny and sexism. His attraction to Holland is a welcome advent into his broken emotional state, and Holland returns his interest-until she learns he's the CEO. By then, however, they've already gotten physical, and hooked MLB for the project Holland developed and Oliver tweaked. 
 Then, there's drama. It's all really rational and reasonable: Holland not wanting people to believe she climbed the corporate ladder using sex with Oliver, not her creativity and hard work. Oh, and there's a couple break ups/make ups that cause each of them to really consider the meaning of family, and merit-based rewards, and feminism, and equality. I don't want to give too much away, but the plot has a few turns I wasn't expecting. That said, I think I mostly didn't expect them because they were 99.9% unlikely to happen anywhere in real life, and I'm not an unrealistic person when reading realistic fiction. So, yeah, I kind of rolled my eyes on those things, and kept reading on anyway. The relationship-building between Oliver and Holland is hard work, they are young people for all their career accomplishments: both 26. Yeah, that was unrealistic, too. And, Oliver came off as sullen and spoiled for a good part of the book. Granted, I liked when he was happy, but a lot of the time he felt whiny to me. I liked Holland a lot, and wanted to assure her-like her good friends did-that she didn't have to be so very independent. It's really not how the corporate world works, but I could appreciate that level of naivete because of her age. 
 There's a happy ending for all, and some steamy bits, too. It's not a terribly long book, and will likely appeal to people who enjoy romances featuring smart-pants gals and a CEO that's not too pushy.

 Mason's not sure if Police Chief Nash Flint becoming a regular customer is good thing, or not. Well, they could certainly use the business, but Mason, as the youngest child in the criminally-troubled Hanks family, certainly has mixed feelings about the close-proximity of law enforcement.

 Not that Nash is feeling any less conflicted. Even though he arrested Mason's eldest brother for criminal mischief-and knowing he's had more than a dozen run-ins with Hanks trouble over the years-Nash can certainly appreciate what a bright spark Mason is. It's not just the delicious food that brings him to Mason's bar almost daily. Pushing forty, Nash has kept a tight rein on his sexuality for his entire life, knowing his family-his town-would hardly approve of a gay police chief. He's always kept his liaisons on the super-down-low, but, maybe, if Mason were interested in him...couldn't they (perhaps) have a little fun under cover(s)? 
 I'm not going to be coy about it: Mason is VERY interested. But, it's difficult. Mason's family has been at odds with the Flints since Nash's father was police chief. Hanks' have always been ne'er-do-wells but Mason's broken that mold. He's kind and compassionate, committed to bringing tourism and tourist money to this dying hamlet. Mason's family issues include bringing his destitute father and brother restaurant left-overs, and assisting in the care of his seven year old niece, too, and he does this with an open heart-even though he's frustrated with his brother's lack of direction/parental skills. Nash sees all of this, and it only makes Mason that much more irresistible. Mason's compassion-and cooking-lures Nash to secret ""cooking lessons"" at Mason's home in which food is prepared but they mostly consume each other. This hidden romance is tenuous and tender, as each man recognizes the importance of their connection, and how troubling it would be for the world at-large to learn of it. 
 Still, Mason's not happy being relegated to acquaintance in public, even though he knows his family would rail against the relationship. And Nash's mother pretty-much thinks Nash ought to be celibate, or hide his sexuality forever, which has become a tiresome existence for Nash. I loved how they worked through this, though it comes with some rotten heartbreak-y moments. The white-hot attraction tempers into a smooth and tasty love before too long, which, when the lid pops, leads to some challenging moments and big decisions. I felt like this was handled in a realistic and admirable way, for both characters. The book is a careful back-and-forth, and having both Mason and Nash narrate the story helps us see how complex and complicated their worlds are, and how much they both risk and sacrifice to find love with one another. I really enjoyed this one, and look forward to new stories in Rainbow Cove. There are at least three of Mason's dear friends who remain unattached, so I'm sure we'll experience these guys finding love in the near future.

 Ashton Townsend, also known as A-Town, is a celebrity of dubious distinction. His family owns a telecom company, but he's the black sheep known more for his unauthorized sex tape and twitter feed than any of his philanthropy. And that's okay, Ash supposes. Just because he's notorious doesn't mean he can't help out. Still, Ash knows he's mostly being used by his hangers on, and expects that's pretty much all he deserves. 
 Val is the son of Ash's former nanny. He's had a long-standing love for Ash, despite his mixed feelings about Ash and his family. Way back when, Val's mom sacrificed time with Val and his sister to take care of Ash and his brothers-and that was hard to take. Then, Val was hired by Mr. Townsend on the down-low to help keep Ash out of the tabloids. It was money Val couldn't turn down-and Val's still working crap jobs to pay his sister's college tuition. If he can win a few fights, he will qualify for the Olympic team. Then, he'd have time to do more than work. Being in close proximity to Ash's life gave Val insight into Ash's tender nature. Val was ashamed of how few others, including Ash's own family, really tried to know the tender, loving person Ash was-beneath his glamorous persona. Val has never forgotten. It's why Val will give up his few hours of sleep to 'rescue' Ash from bad situations. 
 It's also why Val's in love with Ash, and now he's ashamed he ever took money to hang out with Ash, even if he used the money to care for his mom when she was dying. Now he's not sure what to do. Ash needs his companionship, but the one time they got physical turned bad, fast. Can they build a relationship? Or will A-Town's circus life upset Val's training to be an Olympic boxer. 
 This is a tender romance between long-time friends who are learning how to be lovers. I enjoyed seeing Ash learn he's worthy of love, even though it was somewhat bittersweet seeing Ash and Val fall for one another. I understood the conflict and why Val held back-both the truth and his love: he didn't believe he was worthy, either. Expect a good bit of back and forth as Val comes to Ash's rescue, and Ash learns to stand on his own. They make a good couple eventually, and I liked being in their heads. There are many other characters that interact with both Val and Ash, so now I'm trying to figure out which one might get a book. I'm fairly sure we'll see one of Val's toughest opponents find love, soon.... (Fingers crossed!)",Thu Jul 27 16:41:28 -0700 2017,Thu Jul 27 16:42:53 -0700 2017,Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 -0700 2017,,0,0

 Clem Tallyfer, bastard son of his Grace, the (late) Earl of Moreton, manages a lodging house, as part of his consideration from his half-brother, Edmund Talliefer, the current earl. He is half-Indian, and attractive, but fussy and prone to fits of nerves when his schedule is off or he's in the company of too many people at once. He's a master at propriety, which is why he's unable to make any overtures to his lodger, Rowley Green, despite some long acquaintance. 
 Rowley is a quiet, genial man who really finds Clem attractive. He's sure Clem thinks little of him, for as many nights as they 've shared tea and Clem never made any overtures. It takes months, but Rowley begins to see that Clem is merely incapable of considering that another might fancy him, and once their desires are made plain, these men find ways to make a surreptitious liaison happen. 
 Clem's life is complicated nearly daily by one lodger, the constantly inebriated Lugtrout, a former minister, and a person Edmund insists Clem manage. It's all Clem can do to maintain his composure around the blowhard, but it soon won't be his problem--when Lugtrout is gruesomely murdered. This kicks off the mystery portion of the book, and it is a slower evolving story than I expected. That said, there's a LOT happening, in terms of the murder and mayhem, and I didn't feel it was developed enough--mainly leaving the mystery to be solved in the books going forward. I wasn't prepared for that, which left me feeling a little frustrated, but I did like the Rowley and Clem bits, because I thought they were a sweet pair. 
 The next book is set to feature two other characters finding love, and finding the murderer(s), perhaps, but Rowley and Clem find their happiness in this first story of the series.

 The first book, AN UNSEEN ATTRACTION, featured the mystery, mischief and murder that befell Clem Tallyfer, bastard son of his Grace, the (late, late) Earl of Moreton as he managed a lodging house, and fell in love with Rowley Green, one of his lodgers. 
 This story continues the investigation of whomever killed one of Clem's lodgers, Reverend Lugtrout, and also Clem's half-brother, Edmund, then the earl. 
 It seems there is some dispute regarding the entailment of the Moreton estate. As Edmund had no legal offspring, it should go to Edmund and Clem's uncle--who cannot wait to evict Clem from his lodging house. Clem's dear friend, Nathaniel Roy, is charged with assisting him in his legal dealings, but Nathaniel is also a writer, an investigative journalist of the time. He's in the midst of sussing out the sham of one Seer of London, Justin Lazarus, who makes his living preying on the elite of society as a communicator with those beyond the veil. 
 Justin Lazarus is a 5-bit hustler of the first order. He knows all the tricks and plies his trade on the susceptible. How is it, then, that this charlatan is able to connect Nathaniel with the deepest of his many secrets, his lost love, Tony? Not only that, Justin has unwittingly received evidence of the (late) earl's secret marriage and even more secret progeny. Justin needs Nathaniel to help him as he becomes a prime target for not only Edmund's murderer, but also that of two opportunistic men who wish to claim the earl's fortune as their own. 
 Nathaniel and Justin have no love lost between them, but that doesn't hide their mutual attraction. What begins auspiciously turns out to genial once Nathaniel and Justin take off for parts north to escape London's killer fog and the actual killers chasing them. It's a very sweet romance that develops, as these adversaries turn advocates. Nathaniel recognizes Justin's keen intellect, and admires his wit and courage. Justin's taken by Nathaniel, but he's unwilling to be another man's pawn, or possession, ever again. As they aren't social equals it seems doomed, but Nathaniel finds a way to blend their lives, if only Justin will trust him. 
 I really enjoyed the suspense and thrilling moments of chase through this historical landscape. The author makes great use of the natural elements--in this case the historic fog of 1873--and brings the story into a whole new sphere. The earl's progeny are discovered and I was happy when it turned out I had correctly guessed the identity. There's so much chicanery happening with regard to this inheritance that the heir, once names, is still in mortal danger. It's interesting how the story has now turned another corner and will no doubt begin a new romance that will once and for all settle Clem's claim to his boarding house and seems to solidify the growing bond between Nathaniel and Justin. While the first book seemed to move at a slower pace, this one had several full-on investigations, and it seemed we were learning more and more--yet still stuck on the resolutions!--with each page turn. I liked the way the enemies-to-lovers trope was utilized here, and also how these guys got past their preconceived notions--and actual prejudices--to risk their hearts and lives on love. I'm so looking forward to the conclusion!",Fri Jun 30 19:20:15 -0700 2017,Fri Jun 30 20:03:07 -0700 2017,Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 -0700 2017,,0,0

The love of his life, Kallie, has finally confessed that she's not able to marry him-despite loving him-because she's really in love with another woman. And, also, she's pregnant with his child. This all happens a few months before their intended wedding date. Wheeler's an orphan, and only with Kallie's family did he find a home, but Kallie's fear of coming out to her parents has left Wheeler looking like a Class-A Jerk to her folks. 
 So, he's sexing his way through half of Denver to avoid sitting alone in the Kallie-furnished home he bought for her and their family. He's a good guy, making bad decisions, but none of that matters when he begins to build a rapport with Poppy Cruz. 
 Poppy is on the fringe of the Denver cadre of barmen and tattoo artists due to her sister, Salem, attached to Rowdy-their childhood neighbor. She's lived through emotional and physical abuse, and kidnap, rape and torture by her deceased ex-husband. Her father, a respected minister, is a head case who psychologically battered Poppy, Salem and their mother all their lives. Wheeler has some sense of this, and approaches Poppy with caution, and compassion. 
 They bond over the training of a rescue dog Poppy brings Wheeler, and each work through their trauma with frank discussions and small gestures. Soon, Poppy recognizes that she'd like more, and Wheeler's content to move at her pace. 
 This is a sweet and tender romance that brings Poppy's family full circle, and closes the loop on the Denver stories from Crownover. We have lots of looks at good friends from the Saints books and also Marked Men, but this always feels like Poppy and Wheeler's story. They make peace with Kallie, and her family, and their demons, but there's still more struggle for Poppy to endure. I liked how Wheeler found family when he least expected to, and how he made a life with the family he built.

 16 year old Tori Burns is new to rural Chaptico, Maryland. Her adoptive mother, brother and herself mysteriously inherited twenty acres of land and a home smack dab in the middle of the Slaughter farm, bequeathed by Al Senior upon his death several months ago. It was just in time, too, as Tori's family had been recently evicted from their apartment. (There's some shenanigans about this that I'll describe later.) 
 Tori hasn't been the same since her adoptive father died a year ago. Since then, she's quit swimming--though she was an expert swimmer--because she can't imagine doing it without her father cheering her on. Also, she's begun cutting her skin to mask the grief she's experiencing. Her arms and legs are covered in scars, and she regularly presses on healing cuts to induce pain when necessary. She's an outsider in her school which has lots and lots of Slaughter kids, all of whom have the status. Jesse Slaughter is the typical king of the school, and Tori can't figure out why he's talking to her and asking her to Homecoming. 
 One night, when the pain is too great, Tori runs out to the small graveyard on the edge of the property and digs a sharp branch into her arm. The blood shed releases a centuries-old curse and, inexplicably, a man from his shallow grave. Tori's appropriately horrified by the advent of this former-servant of age-old Slaughter Farm, Nathaniel, and that's only the beginning. She's plagued by nightmares of the Chaptico Witch, Emmeline, who was the love of Nathaniel back in the seventeenth century. 
 So, you can see, this was a really different plot line. The POV shifts between 1690s Nathaniel's memories, the present-day, and dreams/visions Tori experiences from Emmeline's magic. Because, she was a witch, and she did love Nathaniel enough to preserve him until he could fulfill his sworn duty to protect her. 
 There are many interesting themes here: dealing with grief, learning about your history, becoming the person you were meant to be, doing the right thing, as well as the folly of greed and the horror of locking down one's family skeletons. I think I didn't really get hooked until about a third of the way through, mostly because I was a little stupefied by some of the issues Tori faces. 
 See, her mom is a volunteer art teacher. Her father dies and has no life insurance, leaving them essentially destitute. They have no other family and are on the verge of eviction. Sorry, I'd be working at a paying job, folks. And, the grief really isn't an excuse for me. The whole set-up seemed shady, and it put me off. I almost had less trouble accepting the magical resurrection of Nathaniel than their real-life crisis of near-homelessness. Also, her mom is practically unable to keep this family together. Beyond driving and painting, she has virtually no life skills despite being a mother for 16+ years. It was insulting, honestly. So, shenanigans. I call it. 
 The isolation Tori experienced was far easier to accept as a reader. New girl in a small town. She's odd and weird. No doubt she'll struggle to fit in. The double-crosses were to be expected, and I didn't think that was a deficit. Plot-wise, I liked the interwoven POVs and I liked Nathaniel, a lot. Tori, at times, seems deliberately obtuse, but she comes to terms with her position in the tangled history with Nathaniel, Emmeline and the Slaughters past and present. It doesn't help that the current Slaughters are experiencing unprecedented tragedy--including blight, fire and death--and they pin it to the arrival of Tori and her family. It's a mystery why these events are occurring, to everyone but Nathaniel, Tori and an elderly black neighbor who knows more than her family with believe. 
 I liked how this turned out in the end, with much faster pacing and a tumultuous climax. For me, the book is an interesting allegory for the power of greed to destroy and of love to reclaim/redeem. That said, it's still troubling how little assistance was available for Tori, with both her grief and her cutting.

They have always had each others' backs, but Maddox has wanted more for a long time, now. Especially since the past two years when Ben has lived in his apartment, after his nasty divorce from Trey. Ben's been a man-about-town, never banging the same guy twice, since Trey disappeared, not that he didn't get around bunches what with their very open marriage. But Maddox wants Ben all to himself, and struggles to hide his desires in order to maintain their close friendship. 
 It's time for Maddox to re-up with the SEALs, and he's not sure he wants to. He's got some money saved, and has been working on his baking for years now. Even if his dream comes to pass and he and Ben become a couple, they couldn't stay on the same team any longer. Besides, the reason Maddox got into the service in the first place was to prove to his homophobic family that he was just as much a man as any other, no matter who he loved. Knowing that they will never accept him as he is, even if he should die for his country? Well, kinda takes the impetus away for proving one's self. 
 While out on a dangerous mission, Ben and Maddox get temporarily left behind, and it brings their world together into extreme focus for both men. Maddox is seriously injured, and Ben is tasked with keeping off the enemy and keeping Maddox alive until they can be rescued. During those stressful hours Ben recognizes that he needs Maddox in his life, no matter what. And the peculiar feelings he's been having-about him and Maddox together for real-are banging through his concussed head. 
 Stateside, their healing isn't only of the physical. Maddox and Ben need to be near one another to feel whole, and their time in the hospital brings clarity for Ben: he needs to try to love Maddox they way he needs to be loved-because Ben can't exist in a world where Maddox isn't by his side. Maybe, Ben thinks, if he seduces Maddox, then Maddox won't leave the SEALs; won't leave him, as his mother and husband did... 
 I really enjoyed the slow burn as these two felt their way toward a loving, intimate relationship. They have always been each other's best friend, and they've had a deep intimacy in terms of knowing one another, but the step into lovers hasn't been easy. Maddox has very defined ideas about monogamy, thoughts Ben hasn't had in years now, but for Maddox he'd give up a whole lot. Maddox knows Ben wants him on his team, in the trenches, and in bed-behind closed doors-but Maddox is beyond doing what other people want. He needs to do for himself, and if Ben walks away, well it'll hurt deep, but Maddox will weather that storm and find a man who can love him for who he is, not what he does. Maddox wants a settled life, and he wants Ben in it, but Ben has to choose him. And, well, I'll just say that (eventually) Ben makes the right choice. 
 This one is hot and steamy and sexy and sentimental and fabulous. I could hang out in Maddox's kitchen all day and half the night. Ben is a grouch, but the kind of grouch that is endearing. He grows a lot during the time of the story, and makes the right decisions, eventually, to find his own happiness. I liked how he made things right within his family, and opened himself up to forgiving people who'd hurt him. I highly recommend this one!

After being falsely accused of a crime, she's stuck under stepmother-imposed house arrest and her BFF's gone ghost. Tatum fills her newfound free time with community service by day and working at her covert graphic design business at night (which includes trading emails with a cute cello-playing client). 
 When Tatum discovers she's not the only one in the house keeping secrets, she finds she has the chance to make amends with her family and friends. Equipped with a new perspective, and assisted by her feisty step-abuela-slash-fairy-godmother, Tatum is ready to start fresh and maybe even get her happy ending along the way. 
 My Review: 
 Tatum Elsea is a sixteen y/o girl caught in a bad situation. Her rebellious bestie was dating bad boy--and she's just been charged as an accessory to grand larceny when the idiot steals four iPhones from a store and jumps into Tatum's car. 
 Tatum's parents are supremely disappointed, not that she's ever felt like anything less than a disappointment to her perfect stepmother. Tatum's friend is furious, and missing-in-action after her fed-up father ships her off to a boarding school. Tatum's charges are dropped in exchange for 100 hours of community service and a $500 fine, which she has to pay herself. And, she's essentially under house arrest for the entire summer. Sure, her step-sister Tilly is home, but they hardly ever speak. Tilly's gifted, and a dancer at an elite high school for the arts--that disappointing Tatum didn't gain acceptance into. Her beloved father is away on a diplomatic mission to Africa, too, so it's just Tatum, Tilly, the step-monster and Blanche, her step-grandma. Blanche is a free-spirited gal, though, and proves to be one speck of happiness in an ocean of frustration, as far as Tatum's concerned. 
 This is a bittersweet story that ends up being really awesome. The beginning is all about separation--Tatum's support networks all disappear--but she cobbles together new ones, and forges better connections within her world as a result. Tatum's got a lot of trouble in front of her, and it's not exactly all her fault. I could really sympathize with her anger over the way her parents treat her. It's not as if she planned the arrest; she was being a friend to her bestie, and had no idea the boyfriend was a thief. And, I also thought their treatment of her was overly harsh. As an outsider to Tatum's life, the narrative is structured to throw her stepmother into the harshest light possible, which is misleading. The lack of communication was frustrating, for me as a reader and mother. I can't imagine being so high-handed and never explaining why. Sorry. That said, I liked how Tatum found constructive ways to survive her punishment, and earn her fine payment. She's a great girl who's in need of a hug, probably several everyday. Her life, though it isn't terrible, hasn't been easy wither, and she could have used some counseling at some point. Or, hey, a human conversation every now and again. I get that her step-mom had issues, but be an adult, for goodness sake. Even her daughter was terrified of her critique. 
 In the midst of this summer, Tatum recognizes that she's making friendships--and perhaps more--with the few people with whom she's interacted this summer, both in community service, and her new business venture. It's sweet seeing Tatum vindicated in the end, with her bestie making all the right moves better late than never. And, a little romance, too. Tatum's summer that started with goodbye ends up ending with bliss. Sweet, innocent and having strong themes of making it through hardship while dealing with overbearing parents, this book will appeal to most YA readers.

 Devan Thompson is a 24 y/o mechanic who desperately wants to know who his family was. He was given up for adoption, but the family who took him disintegrated when he was young and he was shuffled from placement to placement and group home to group home until he aged out of the system. He recently learned that his birth mother is alive and part of a prominent family in Porthkennack, a seaside town on England's Atlantic coast, so he's come on an extended holiday to attempt to meet her in person, now that his attempts to reach her via email have been ignored. 
 While getting up his courage, and staking out the lay of the land in Porthkennack, Dev meets Kyle, when it seems he's collapsed due to heavy drinking at eleven in the morning. That's what a local girl says, anyway, as the townies see, Kyle, the strange new resident, as a lewd mystery. Dev didn't smell any alcohol though, and some of his ""caregivers"" were chronic alcoholics, so he's familiar with the signs. Digging deeper, Dev learns that Kyle was diagnosed with narcolepsy and cataplexy, and he is often struck by attacks of either quite suddenly. He retired from his job as a barrister, fearing that he'd have an attack while in court, and not being able to control his situation left him bitter and frustrated. Kyle's unsure what Devan might want with a surly, broken man like himself, and isn't excited to even begin a friendship. But, Devan also knows people, not just cars, and he's got precious little else to do. Reuniting with his mum seems as exercise in failure, and he's glad to have Kyle's shoulder to cry on when it gets ugly. 
 I liked this textured and layered story of two isolated men building a connection that makes them both whole. Devan's sweet and faithful attitude is a balm to Kyle's wounded heart. Kyle has worked his whole life for a career that now seems moot--and he laments giving up on so many opportunities to have a richer life for studies that haven't borne fruit. Kyle has a lot of resentment about his disability, but Dev hardly finds it a challenge; he's searching out ways to accommodate Kyle's attacks and Kyle's touched that this stranger is more compassionate and conscientious than his former lover of several years. Meanwhile, Dev's always lamented his lack of family. He's desired the connections all his friends have--someplace to go come Christmas, and people who build a life around knowing you. His dreams are realized in Porthkennack, but not in the way he anticipated. This is a sweet and tender romance, with some steam, but it's also an interesting story that educated me regarding new disabilities and the insensitivity some have towards afflicted persons.

He's just about to do this until he learns the powder keg that is Mosely is about to blow sky-high. 
 Mosely, this small Montana town, situated a few miles of mountainous forest from the unprotected Canadian border, is a hot bed of criminal activity due to long-time smuggling operations. Wade is usually in the center of whatever is going down, but this time Wade wants out of Mosely just as bad as Jericho. Thing is, their local homesteading militia has recently been co-opted by folks from out of state, gunning--literally--for a showdown with the Federal agents policing the border. 
 They stage an ambush killing some agents, which is horrible, but that seems like it was merely a means to an end for these hardliners. No, they have an even bigger agenda, and it soon becomes starkly clear that Mosely is poised to become ground-zero for a militia-led war on the Federal government. It's impossible to prevent with as small as a police force as exists in Mosely, or is it? 
 I really loved the tension throughout this book. Jericho is a great investigator, and his brand of no-bull morals is refreshing, even if it's not always aligned with police procedure. Wade and Jericho have been a building issue for more than a month, with both of them acknowledging they have a deep connection, but not being able to openly embrace it while they exist on opposite sides of the law. Wade's exasperation with Jericho's determination to do what's right, even when it means certain death, is endearing, and I was so engaged with these guys in the climax. Expect firefights, dastardly militia, small-town folks protecting their own, and a well-deserved change of scenery. The end of the story, most enjoyable, might could be the beginning of a new one. (Yay!) I know I'd follow Wade and Jericho into further entanglements, especially if I get to experience their growing love story up close and personal! 
 I highly recommend the whole series, and know that I enjoyed this one best because I read the books in order. As they are all out now, it's easy to pick up the collection and binge-read away.",Thu May 18 15:25:58 -0700 2017,Thu May 18 15:26:38 -0700 2017,Thu May 18 15:26:39 -0700 2017,,0,0

He's got some family, but they're all crazier than him, and he knows from crazy. Theo, his estranged twin, has more powerful empathic gifts and moved to NYC shortly after high school ended, but Nate's hidden his empath abilities nearly his whole life, like their mother--who went crazy and killed herself--had instructed. Nate wants to fly under the radar, but he's overcome by a vision of Theo being drowned, in a way that's totally sketchy, and he knows his brother is dead. The only way to discover the truth behind it: head to NYC. Only Nate has barely a few hundred dollars to his name, and his big idea--to hitch his way from Texas--isn't the smartest. 
 Trent is a graduate student living in LA and driving home the southern route so he can visit friends in Houston. This has him crossing paths with Nate twice. The second time, he offers Nate a ride. Along the several days ride, Trent and Nate develop a connection, which is far stronger than Nate has ever experienced. Though Trent has never had sexual relations with a man, he believes himself to be bisexual, and he wants some intimacy with Nate. Nate's attracted to Trent, too, but he's used to walling himself off from everyone to keep their emotions out of his head. So, both are reluctant to make the first move. Not that it doesn't happen, because it does, but this isn't a traditional romance. What happens in New Orleans, though, doesn't stop when the trip ends. 
 Still, once they reach the bright lights of NYC, Nate goes his own way, promising to keep in touch with Trent. Nate knows he needs to touch base with Theo's closest friends if he wants to learn the truth, and he doesn't want to involve Trent in what might be dangerous. Plus, Trent doesn't know about the empath community and Nate's afraid Trent will balk if he thinks Nate is somehow using his gift to influence Trent into being gay-for-him. Connecting with Theo's pals alerts The Community that Nate's on the scene, however. 
 The Community is a hidden network of empaths and telepaths in the NYC area. Nate had no idea of the scope, what with his sheltered rural Texas life, but he's appropriately wary of the cadre of folk who want his loyalty and service. The more Nate learns, the more sinister things seem, and he reaches out to Trent for some normalcy, and insight, because Trent is truly the only person he feels he can trust. I really liked the twists and turns of this one. Expect it to morph into a thriller near the end. More empaths have gone missing/dead than just Theo, and Nate's put himself on a path that is far from safe by poking through the hornet's nest of intrigue that is The Community. As a reader, it was hard to know from what corner the danger came, and that's a testament to the fantastic writing here. The romance is not formulaic, and was all the more interesting due to the odd circumstances. Also, it was freaking unbelievably hot when Trent and Nate got it on. Nate's empathic abilities grow, and he's able to experience his and Trent's lust, and turn that back on them--creating a chemistry that is downright combustible.

Still, Rick Fine suits his name, and Seth's more frustrated than ever. 
 Rick Fine isn't just a consul--he's deep cover CIA tactics, and sure his predecessor was doing some shady, shady things that led to his fatal ""accident."" How to prove it as a stranger in a new place? Make use of all his tactical training--and keep Seth handy. Even if he's guilty for hiding a secret about Seth's past mission. It's not long before Rick turns up discrepancies in budgets and humanitarian aid drops seemed inexplicably filled with weapons instead of medicine. But, those powerful people who made the former consul go away are certainly not interested in keeping snoopy Rick Fine alive. Nope, that's Seth's problem. 
 This books takes place over several seriously action-packed days. Seth discovers weaknesses in the security, and Rick uses his deep cover contacts to flush out the perpetrators who're using the consul's office to traffic arms. Thing is, people keep turning up dead, and Seth and Rick might soon be one of them. Expect steamy sexytimes, shoot-outs, and a raging inferno of more than lust.

He'd struggled with weight issues, and addiction in his childhood, but he's clean and sober, now. Still, it's not easy to make his way in the world. A former runaway/homeless teen, he'd seen the worst of life on the streets. He doesn't have a fancy degree-or even and unfancy one-but he's a true blue spirit, willing to go the extra mile and work twice as hard as the next guy. He's currently working in an upscale bakery, and that's where he meets Kendall. 
 Kendall is a genderqueer man who is definitely gay, but unhappy in his usual ""role"" due to his feminine-leaning fashion and slighter stature. He's met Todd on several occasions when he brings wedding-planning clients to the bakery. And, there's a spark, for sure. Todd has old-fashioned manners, and treats Kendall with respect. When Kendall's partner for ballroom dancing classes cancels, he asks Todd to stand in-delighted to learn that Todd was a champion dancer in his early childhood. Todd isn't a spotlight kind of guy-not anymore-but he agrees to be a partner to Kendall when he learns it's all part of a benefit for the homeless shelter that rescued Todd from the streets. 
 I really liked the slower pace of this romance, because Todd's history isn't like those of the men Kendall usually dates. Todd wants a partnership, more than a casual partner. They have dinners together, and talk, and dance, and have some shenanigans. But that's only after some very frank and honest discussions about risk. Because those conversations are necessary for these guys. I also really liked the way that Todd accepted Kendall's genderqueer identity. Kendall has had many experiences of being belittled for his outre habits, yet, Todd admires him earnestly. This is a sweet tale, and the love story spoke to me-for all of it's challenges. 
 For series fans we get a little bit of Vic from BAKED FRESH, as Todd works in his bakery. I liked how close Todd was with his Gran, and how hard he works to remain sober. It's interesting at the beginning when Kendall teases Todd about his age, and Todd thinks about how aged he is for such a ""young"" person. He's a guy who thought his life was mostly over before it had even begun, and considers himself unworthy of love. But, Kendall's insecurities fit him-they fit each other in the right ways. They are able to support one another emotionally, and that means a lot to these two guys who really do want a solid love. It was an interesting and engaging read in this novella series, and I devoured it in one night-time gulp.",Wed May 03 16:25:20 -0700 2017,Wed May 03 16:26:11 -0700 2017,Mon Apr 03 00:00:00 -0700 2017,,1,0

He's grieved terribly, while putting up a strong front for his young twin daughters, Chloe and Sophia. His mother lives in his home, and helps with the childcare, but she's leaving for a two month trip to Greece with her sisters-a lifelong dream she's saved for years to experience-and Apollo needs help. 
 His best friend, Dustin, has arranged to get a suitable person to care for Apollo's girls: his younger brother, Dylan. Dylan's just graduated college with a degree in childhood education, and wants to manage recreation classes for kids. He's got a gig teaching at the summer camp Apollo's girls are attending, and will be an excellent caregiver, if only he can remember not to fall for Apollo. Again. See, Dylan met Apollo years and years ago, when he came to visit Dustin during a leave, and Apollo was the center of all Dylan's teenaged (and not so teenaged) sexual fantasies. He's attracted to Apollo the SEAL, but Apollo the Broken-Hearted? Apollo the Loving Father? #GoneBabyGone 
 Apollo wallows in his burgeoning attraction to Dylan, quelling his lust by reminding himself that Dylan is Dustin's baby brother-and twelve years younger than himself. Thing is, Dylan is a strong, assertive man who appreciates Apollo's micromanaging schedules, and does his darnedest to make Apollo's life easier. Plus he's fabulous with Chloe and Sophia. Living in Apollo's home puts Dylan right in the eye of the storm-he hadn't realized Apollo spent his nights in the guest room where Dylan sleeps-until Apollo confesses how he's hardly slept in his own bed in the two years since Neal died. It's a heart wrenching experience, watching Apollo deal-poorly-with his grief, and deny himself any thoughts of finding love again, out of loyalty to the memory of Neal. 
 Dylan is a great young man. He's a partner, and a lover, when Apollo needs one desperately. Still, he's not getting his needs met, not while Apollo insists on keeping Dylan firmly in the role of 'babysitter', and Dylan's smart enough to stand up for himself, especially when Apollo is way out of line. 
 I loved how tender this was, and how authentically the love story developed. This isn't an easy love, but it has the possibility of being a great one. Knowing people who never remarried after losing a spouse, I really connected with Apollo's grief, and I was relieved when he finally connected to it, as well. There's a lot of healing in the book-some of it sexual healing-and there's going to be a break up to make up, but it's really well handled and felt true. Raising twin girls can't be easy, but they didn't take over the story. 
 I loved these guys, and I loved how they found love together.",Mon Apr 17 16:19:47 -0700 2017,Mon Apr 17 16:20:42 -0700 2017,,,3,0

He loves his quiet life, but would love to find a man to share it with. He certainly didn't expect the shy, awkward, bow-tie-clad Lawson Gale to fall right into his path. Butterfly expert Lawson is out on Tasmania to help a colleague find a figment. An aging lepidopterist clams to have found a small copper-colored butterfly decades ago, and has tasked Lawson with his fruitless hunt. 
 Lawson's upset that his car reservation has been lost, but he's desperate to meet with his colleague, and accepts an offer of a ride from the burly forest agent he'd noticed on his flight. They hit it off, especially when Jack learns Lawson will be staying near his home--a small community known as Scottsdale--and searching for this elusive butterfly in the forest area Jack manages. 
 Over the course of the next several days, these two find ways to be together, on the hunt for the copper butterfly, and in more personal settings. It's absolutely sweet how Jack woos Lawson with charming date nights that lead to more and more steam. I really enjoyed the science-y bits, too, as I'm a nerd. It seems that Jack's more than a burly tote-hauler; his research, coupled with decades of stored data, provide real clues to where Lawson's butterfly might possible exist. 
 The end is more climactic than the quiet romance intimated, and it's a daring race and rescue that Lawson manages to both instigate and require. This book is a delicious romance with great characters and just enough complications to keep it interesting.

It was excellent skill that kept them both alive, but Travis' back and nerve damage takes a constant toll--one he doesn't want to medicate, or he'll be relieved of duty. Let's not forget that Trav's a proud man, too, and unwilling to relent his position or admit he should be on disability. He's bisexual, but more attracted to men, than women--and the only person he ever loved was a fellow pilot who couldn't out himself before he was tragically killed. 
 Lt. Commander Clint Fraser is rebuilding his life after suffering PTSD over a drone mission gone wrong. Unable to speak about the super-classified mission, he treated his nightmares with liquor until his wife left, and too the kids with her. Clint hasn't had a drink in two years, but his ""coming out"" at the Navy Ball is all kinds of messed up when Clint's date shows up roaring drunk. The up-side? Travis Wilson noticed that Clint's bisexual. 
 Travis and Clint work in the same building, but aren't in the same chain of command. When they recognize that spark building between them, they keep it mostly quiet, so they can see if it builds or fizzles. Trav's sure it'll fizzle, as he's not fit for the kind of sexual activity most gay men enjoy. Clint's not put-off though, because he likes the rapport they build, and he's not picky regarding his sexual activity; if everyone is satisfied, it's fine to keep it a little less physically-challenging. 
 I liked how Travis' adult daughter plays a role in the book. She's got PTSD from being a family member of an actively deployed airman, and I thought that was a unique perspective to experience. Clint's family situation is a messed up, with Skype visits and supervised visitation, and that seemed excessive. I was glad that Clint started to stand up for himself by the end of the book. Travis and Clint claim to want to keep things light, but they keep reaching out for one another, emotionally and physically. I liked the way their relationship built. The sexytimes are nice and sensual, even if they aren't filthy-raw, and the accommodations they make to keep Travis from experiencing heightened pain were clearly defined. It felt very realistic, and sweet. The deeper their bond grows, the more Travis begins to freak out. It was good he got some sense smacked into him by his daughter, friends and Clint--who isn't willing to take a brush-off. The end is an HEA.

He learned his no-good criminal father was murdered when he was summoned back to Mosley, Montana after a 15 year absence. His previously unknown step-mother, Nikki, and two half-siblings are in danger--probably of their own making--due to the high likelihood that Nikki (and Jericho's father) were running drugs over the border for Wade Granger. Wade is Jericho's high school boyfriend, though that was all kept undercover way back when. 
 Doesn't mean that Jericho's forgotten the pull toward Wade in the intervening years. Wade's a slick guy, though, and while he's surely a criminal, no one can get anything to stick. In the last book Wade helped Jericho save his half-siblings from people who'd been sworn to serve and protect. The sheriff, Jericho's other childhood bestie Kayla, asked Jericho to stick around, work for her to help root out the corruption and he agreed. 
 Since then, it's been one fire after the next--and I mean that literally. Wade's bar and the local biker gang's hangout have both been hit by arsonists, and three Chicago-native drug runners have been found killed execution-style. The DEA is nervous to deal with Jericho, after learning about his familial and emotional ties to Wade Granger--but their also nervous to deal with Kayla because her father might be leaking information to the biker gang. Meanwhile, someone keeps moving drugs over the border, and Jericho's being used by Wade to establish an alibi--not just for Wade by for Nikki. And the Bikers are ready to demonstrate their might in a show that could kill innocents. Jericho's at the center, even if he doesn't want to be. His decisions to forge links between the factions puts him in a precarious place, and leads to his ultimate discipline when one too many of his cowboy antics can't be tolerated. 
 And Wade keeps coming around with all his sexy eyes and sexy moves and Jericho's really a sucker for Wade. Expect some low level sexytimes for these two. But is Wade's interest just another manipulation? The book's really fast-paced, and the intrigue level is high. Being part of a series, I think you need to read it in order, and let the story build all it's layers.

 Ruby is a teen girl unsure how to manage the demands of her Fireblood heritage in a land where being a Fireblood is a death sentence in itself. Born with the ability to wield fire from her hands, she must release some of this power now and then or she feels pent-up and unstable. She always hides deep in the woods outside their remote village to test and release her fire magic, but the day comes when the Frostblood King's soldiers find her and burn their village for daring to ""harbor"" a Fireblood. They also kill her mother right before Ruby's eyes. 
 She's imprisoned, kept in a state of complete damp and cold to douse her flames, and starved nearly to death, only to be rescued by a Frostblood master, Brother Thistle, and his protector, Arcus. They vow to save her if she will help them kill the king--and that's a bargain Ruby's all too eager to make. 
 Safely ensconced in an abbey to Fors, the god of Frost, Ruby is trained by Brother Thistle in the safe wielding of her flames, and by Arcus in hand-to-hand combat and swordsmanship. Not all the monks are in favor of keeping a Fireblood nearby, however, and view Ruby's training as traitorous to the throne. Over time, Ruby and Arcus develop a camaraderie that slides into attraction. She's there for several months, as the attack on the king is planned for the summer solstice, the time when Ruby's fire magic will be naturally at it's zenith. But, she's frustrated when she learns that the total plan isn't necessarily to kill the king. It turns out that his ice throne, fashioned by Fors a thousand years before, has been corrupted by dark magic, and Thistle and Arcus believe that darkness has inflicted a madness on the king. Perhaps if Ruby melts the throne, she can restore sanity to the king, who can then call off the hunt for Firebloods. 
 Ruby isn't in love with this plan, and feels vengeance is hers to claim--but she's captured by the king's soldiers before she and Arcus can mount their siege. Being a Fireblood, Ruby is pressed into the King's gladiatorial entertainment, fully expected to be killed in her first event. When she wins--aided by magic that isn't hers--Ruby knows she's living on borrowed time. If only she can get her flames on the King's throne before her life is snuffed. 
 For a fantasy, I really found the realistic development of Ruby as a heroine to be excellent. She's not a quick study. She gets frustrated. She makes mistakes that harm her, and those around her, but she's valiant and determined. Ruby wants to be useful, wants to help herself and all the Firebloods, and Brother Thistle is a patient teacher she wants to please. Arcus is moody and mean-spirited at times, pushing and prodding Ruby to get her off-center. He knows the kind of battles she'll face if they can get her into the King's court, and his tough-love approach felt realistic, as well. Her experiences in the King's court are filled with intrigues, humiliation, and brutality. She's forced to meet her mother's killer many times, even in battle, and Ruby has to keep her wits clear to keep herself alive. The magic that afflicts the King is in play throughout the court--and Ruby's not immune. She has the opportunity to embrace this power, and change her place in the world dramatically, but her deep rapport with Thistle and Arcus keep her grounded in a way she hadn't expected. The worldbuilding is really good, with scenes that are fleshed out and a menacing tone imbued throughout the prose. The juxtaposition of ice and fire was a constant theme, and related not just their powers but also the emotional landscape of the players: hot-headed Ruby has burning passions, while Thistle and Arcus are cool, collected and calculating. 
 The love story that develops between Ruby and Arcus is quiet, with only a few moments of acknowledgment before the climax. It seemed a natural progression of their time spent together--from wariness to acknowledgement, to friendship, esteem and eventually attraction. Arcus has a dark history, and his desire to destroy the throne is tied to his intimate knowledge of the king and the monarchy. I was happy that my suspicions regarding his heritage were accurate. I liked the rawness of the experiences that Ruby endures, and how her personal tragedies help forge her into a warrior ready to save herself and those she loves. This book is slated as the first in a series, and ends in a way that completes the initial story arc. There is no cliffhanger, and I expect the next book will have a whole new set of troubles for Ruby to solve--with Arcus at her side.",Mon Feb 20 06:59:15 -0800 2017,Mon Feb 20 07:00:13 -0800 2017,Sat Feb 18 00:00:00 -0800 2017,,0,0

 Mel Hannigan is a seventeen year old girl struggling through her days with a newly (one year) diagnosed bipolar disorder. Her elder brother, Nolan, also suffered this disease, as does her Aunt Joan--who they all call HJ or ""Hurricane Joan."" Nolan, who we only meet in flashback, died four years ago--in an accident that stemmed from his mania. Since his tragic death, her parents have divorced and Mel lives with her mother and HJ. She'd also lived with her grandmother, but she died a year ago after a battle with stomach cancer. 
 Mel works in the Silver Sands, the same nursing home where her grandmother spent her final days. It's a touchstone place, for her, where she has many friends among the residents, including Dr. Jordan--a retired psychiatrist. He helped ""diagnose"" Mel before she had her first manic episode--and subsequent crash--just over a year ago, now. At that time, Mel was having a break with her group of friends, losing Annie, Conner and Zumi when she backed away following a fight and power play which coincided with an inpatient stay for treatment of her mental issues. Now she balances a cocktail of prescriptions designed to keep her moods even, and has two close-ish friends Holly and Declan, who brought her school work home over the period of her long absence and recovery--which everyone believes was for mono and bronchitis, not bipolar disorder. 
 When the book picks up, Annie has inexplicably reached out to leave behind childhood relics with Mel for Conner and Zumi--mementos of their friendship--because Annie's family is moving to Paris and she doesn't want to confront either Conner or Zumi regarding this life change. Turns out Annie isn't a nice person, and Zumi was desperately crushing on her. Mel knows it will break Zumi's heart, and the stress is fracturing her grip on her moods. Right about then, Mel meets David, grandson of one of the elderly residents at Silver Sands, and they strike a cautious friendship--which could lead to more. They both seem to want this, but Mel is reluctant because she doesn't think she--the gal with the broken brain--is really worthy of love. Surely someone ""normal"" is better suited for everyone. Just look at HJ! She's the life of the party and pretty, but no man will settle down with her. 
 Okay, so, being in the mind of a person with a mental condition like bipolar disorder is never easy. There are bouts of mania and depression, and episodes of disordered thinking and obsessive-compulsive behavior. That's not all of the book, but those moments exist and they ramp the tension up high as we're not quite sure where Mel will go, or what she will do, when she's manic, or obsessive. She does a LOT of checking in with her body and mind, and talking to responsible adults about her mental well-being, with is fantastic. Her aunt's not a great influence, because she's sure that Mel's missing out on life, doped up and quelled by medication. Joan is currently unmedicated, but her strong personality doesn't sway Mel from her chosen course to medicate--because she knows how things can go tragically wrong for someone like herself--like Nolan--when there's no meds on board. And, unfortunately, in her periods of mania she sometimes misses doses, leading to a downward spiral that results in another bad episode. 
 I really liked this book because it didn't feel varnished. It was a challenge, however, to keep up with Mel, and I think I'd have liked more information about Nolan up-front. That said, going along the winding path and following Mel into the rabbit hole of her racing mind was eye-opening. Having dealt with emotional wellness issues in myself and close family members for decades now, it was a journey I'm familiar with, and felt resonated off the page. Mental illness is never an easy read, but Mel's upbeat and committed choice for medical care was refreshing. I really appreciated the rich support network that assisted Mel, and how her fears of being abandoned once people learned her real ""illness"" weren't reinforced. 
 There's a hint of romance, but it's not the focus. Instead, the real-life dramas of friendships dissolving and new ones forming are the center of the book. These stressors are common for teens, which provides the context for grasping Mel's underlying medical problems, and makes her reaction to those stressors accessible, even in their extremes.

As a grieving 19 year old, she vowed to ruin the Pierce brothers, Diana's children, who--it seemed--were ""painting"" her artist father as a gold-digging homewrecker. They were surely the reason her father's paintings were returned unsold from galleries and few attended his funeral. 
 Fast forward nine years, or so. Raven's back in her hometown making a decent living owning and running My Place, a homey bar and grill that serves upscale fare with specialty cocktails. The bane of her existence is blonde and bold Dalton Pierce, who can't understand why Raven doesn't fall for his immense charm. Dalton's not a man to settle down--marriage only ruins good people, is his experience. Example One: his mother, who got conned into running off and abandoning her children--only to die in the attempt. 
 Looking back now, Dalton can see the lack of love between his parents, and how his mother pulled farther and farther away, but still! He loved her dearly and can't imagine her leaving of her own choice. Regardless, Dalton never wants to marry, and refuses to date the same woman for more than a few weeks at a time. And he's surely interested in sexy Raven, and her bar. The woodworking artist in him craves the chance to really get his tools on the antique bar which has been haphazardly restored and pressed into active service. Raven won't budge on the dating--despite their undeniable chemistry. She assures him she only wants to date men who are interested in getting married, using his kryptonite to keep his advances at bay, but she does need his woodworking expertise to get My Place camera-ready for a feature in a regional food and wine magazine. 
 Their bargain, to work together to get My Place ready, is complicated by their mutual attraction, and Dalton's persistence in pursuit. It's a heady time, and Raven knows she needs to reveal her murky connection to Dalton's mother's death--but it's not easy to do so. Dalton's brothers, and work partners, are no help. They seem to want Dalton to settle down, and he continues to fight the tide, there. When they finally get physical, it's Dalton who's looking for more, until Raven confesses her history--and that's a deal breaker if Dalton ever heard one. 
 The love story here is tentative and considerate. It's been more than a year that Raven and Dalton have known one another. Dalton's pursuit has extended for several months, and Raven's defenses wear down after they build a solid rapport as friends. Raven's conflicted about being friends with Dalton, considering her vow to take revenge on the Pierce brothers. Thing is, should she continue to harbor ill will over a childhood vendetta that no one even knew about? Raven's grown up a LOT in those nine years and she's a more confident and mature woman than she'd expected to be. Her life is very full--friends, work, mixology--but it lacks love, and she's romantically lonely. I liked her changes and her response to Dalton. 
 Dalton's the baby of his family, and tired of feeling as if his elder brothers consider him a flake. He never got over his mother's abandonment--even though he was a grown adult when she made her move. But, being with Raven soothes that aching place inside that really wants to be totally loved. He's not cool, at all, when he learns about Raven's dad, and I wasn't shocked that she wanted little to do with him following his shenanigans. I did love how he won her back, however, because commitment was what he lacked as a human, and that was the only way to turn her head a second time. The end is a sweet and tender reconciliation that leaves us knowing that a second Pierce brother has been overtaken by the love bug. 
 This one's an HEA. As the second book in the series, it read well as a standalone. Lots of moments where characters from other books popped their heads in for a look-see, but this book is really all about Raven and Dalton. Well, setting aside that it seems as if we've gotten to meet the house-flipper who'll soon win Tristen Pierce's heart in the next book, that is...

 Theo Swann is a writer who runs a weekly marriage paper wherein he posts the ads of lonely people seeking affection, companionship, or marriage for better or worse. He also writes what we'd consider Regency romance under the pseudonym of Dorothea Swann. Theo's barely eeking out a living in his humble printshop-slash-living quarters and is none-too-pleased when Martin St. Vincent, a free black man of some wealth raps upon his door to demand the identity of one of the lonely hearts featured in Theo's paper. 
 Theo may find Martin attractive, but what does he care if coded messages from clandestine lovers are part of his paper. THey paid their money, and he ran their ad. Simple. 
 Martin makes it clear that this is in fact very complicated. He is an agent of a wealthy family--the family which owned him until his 18th birthday as it turns out--and the only daughter of this family seems to be planning an illegal elopement--as the messages indicate. Martin has been pressed, a bit, into helping if he can. And Theo's not really interested in helping, unless he can profit from it. So, Martin offers him money, and Theo discovers the day of their departure from London. For a grand sum, Theo agrees to join Martin on the chase to Scotland, to save this underage silly chit from her ultimate ruination. 
 While Martin and Theo share a mutual interest--they both like men--Martin's not keen on Theo much at first. Still, his intellect surprises him and the long, arduous journey is endearing. For about a day. That's about how long it takes for Theo to blow this who caper sky-high and send Martin into fits trying to cajole his childhood friend from making the greatest mistake of her young life. 
 I'll tell you right now, there's a huge curveball to this plot. It seems like a romance, but it isn't a traditional one. Nor is Theo who he portrays himself to be. While that threw me for a loop, I wasn't averse to the plot shenanigan. It allowed to re-investigate Theo, who--to that point--seemed rather lackluster, in comparison to Martin's stately and intriguing character. Martin is a thriving merchant, set up with an education and some seed money to begin his business from the very family that held his enslaved for fourteen years. The very people he's crossing England at breakneck speed to assist in their domestic dilemma. Theo has trouble fathoming why Martin would lift a finger to help, and can't see the profit in it. Martin is a man of honor, but even honor doesn't bind him to help--and it's an interesting situation for Martin to be in. 
 Theo, for his part, makes a lot of trouble, but also makes a lot of good. He's a man in the worst sort of binds, and has no qualms trying to help himself out of them by any means necessary. He has neither time nor patience for a willful girl snookered by an obvious con-man; not when he's being financially enslaved by his own flesh-and-blood. His assistance to Martin was always going to be mercenary, but falling for Martin wasn't part of the plan. I really found the thematic juxtaposition between Martin's enslavement, Theo's financial situation and the girl's elopement to be fascinating. In the time and place described, a girl's only worth lay in her marriage prospects and this situation--a wretched elopement--would have damaged all hope for her family to ascend higher socially; so her position as property to be granted by her father's whim rendered her into a theoretical ""kind"" of slave. As a fan of historical romance the whole elopement issue has always struck a chord with me, maybe it was because I've come from women who did elope--and their families didn't approve. 
 There's a little bit of sexytimes, a lot a bit of empathy, and a heroic ending that would outdo Mrs. Dorothea Swann's imagination everyday and twice on Sunday. I really did like how this ended, with Martin and Theo finding an accord that is mutually satisfying with neither of them bound by duty, honor or poverty. They can simply be two men who admire each other, and figure out a way to build a future together.

 This is the final novel in the series, and wraps up all the stories nicely. What I didn't know when I bought the book, and was most pleased to learn the second I opened it? Travis is the narrator. All three previous book were from Charlie's point-of-view. 
 Charlie and Travis have been together for over two years now, and-risking a spoiler-Travis had proposed to Charlie at the end of the previous book. Charlie had accepted, knowing that same-sex marriage is not recognized in Australia. So, there was no pressure for a wedding to happen anytime in the near future. That was okay with Travis. He only wanted Charlie to agree to marry him, in principle. But now, a clear year after that one isolated conversation, Charlie's gone and told his younger brother that they were engaged. And Travis wants to know why. 
 It's simple. Charlie Sutton works on his own pace, and don't you try to budge him from it. Also, it means he's been ruminating on the idea, and Travis likes it when Charlie ruminates. As their lives get more wrapped in their station family, Charlie decides to branch out. Invite some ""local"" (in their case a 3 hour drive away) kids to come out and help work the station a bit, see if any of these kids might have an affinity for ranching. Many of his fellow cattle farmers are selling their lands, because the farming's too difficult or they have no children to leave it to, or their kids don't want it. So, part and parcel with Charlie's ruminating on marriage is this idea of legacy. Charlie's frustrated that he doesn't have an easy path to building a legacy-because even if he and Travis were married, they aren't legally able to adopt on account of being gay. 
 Those are some of the themes masterfully crafted into the book. I really just adore this couple, and it was fun to be inside Trav's head the whole time, as he dug into Charlie and figured out what was buried deep into his thought-process. This book brings us on a trip Texas, and Charlie meeting Trav's parents the first time-which is a sweet and tense time for all. I really loved watching Trav go all protective when he thought Charlie had been wronged, and throughout the pages there's an unwavering affection to Charlie and his quirks. 
 I couldn't even be sad that this is the final book in the series, because it was so upbeat, and had so much great stuff going on. The final fifty pages is an epilogue that assures the reader Charlie and Trav have the fullest life one could imagine, and find their happiness for a lifetime under that great big sky treading that silty red dirt. 
 We should all be so lucky.",Thu Jan 12 16:50:50 -0800 2017,Thu Jan 12 17:36:07 -0800 2017,Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 -0800 2017,,2,0

She's finally got a paying job as a research associate at a branding (Advertising) agency, but she's the lowest one on the books there. Her salary is so low she shares a flat with two other people, more than an hour's commute away from work. She admires her friends' Instagram accounts, and fabricates her own ""fab life"" with pictures she grabs on the go--because she could never afford that decadent coffee, or that divine dinner spot. Nope. But, she studies hard, making lists of all the places she's check out just as soon as she launches her way up the ladder to success. 
 Her boss, Demeter, is a criminally scatterbrained woman with far too many fabulous aspects to be truly human. She's always out to dinner, or at an award night, and her family is all shiny and perfect. And, if the office rumor mill can be trusted, Demeter's got a long-standing ""arrangement"" with Alex, the younger partner in their firm--and the man Katie'd thought had a bit of an interest in herself. Katie, who calls herself ""Cat"" in her fab life, studies Demeter, aspiring to learn more and impress her one day soon. It's not meant to be, however. Their branding firm is having some issues with clients and Katie's let go soon after she designed the branding on her father's newest get-rich-quick scheme: glamping on their country estate. 
 Having no other prospects, Katie returns home from London under the premise that she's got a 'sabbatical' to help out her family. Really, she can't admit she had a horrible life in London, because her father's totally against her living there, and she doesn't want to live int he country forever. She's making applications and chatting to headhunters whenever she isn't setting up the glamping yurts, or customizing the ""totally organic experience"" for each of their hoity-toity guests. It's with immediate dismay that Demeter and fam arrive--because she'll blow Katie's cover to her dad. 
 Then again, when Demeter doesn't recognize ""Cat"" in her 'West Country Katie' persona, Katie's able to get some of her own back, torturing Demeter with ""one-of-a-kind,"" ""exclusive,"" ""holistic"" treatments. That is, until Katie grows a conscience, and learns that Demeter isn't as nearly perfect as her Instagram feed would reflect. 
 I really dug this one. It's a more mature, and less-slapstick, type of book than I've read from Ms. Kinsella before. The careful plotting and copious breadcrumbs led me right into the conundrum: how do we cope when life isn't like we spin it? Social media facades, cyberbullying, corporate espionage were not what I expected to find in this one, but, wow! Was this a rich tapestry. Katie's a great character, not too young, despite her naivete, at points. She's fully relatable, as the plucky gal clawing her way out of a hard-scrabble life--only to have her dreams dashed. The amazing turns of situation, particularly regarding Demeter and the jobs at their branding firm, was carefully intimated, and led me along in the proper directions. Plus, I got yet another object lesson in the value of empathy, and being a stand-up person even when it's really freaking hard. Facing down her father, with his absolute love for Katie and desperate want to have her stay home forever? Appropriately heart-crushing. 
 I loved Katie, and how she grew up and owned her life, and her mistakes. There's a bit of cloak-and-dagger business as Katie tries to work herself back into the branding firm--on behalf of Demeter. I liked how there was so much uncertainty regarding Demeter's mental state, and if she really was the horrible/insensitive boss she'd seemed at the beginning, or if this was the product of some illness. Or, worse. Alex's role was definitely interesting, as he's not-quite a hero. He's a regular guy with work problems, too, which was rather enchanting. I love it when the characters are actual humans with everyday problems. The book is a bit long, but the read is easy and the pages turn themselves. I really hoped we'd see a bit of steam on the page, but alas, fade-to-black... *shrugs* Fans of the author won't be disappointed.",Tue Jan 10 11:33:08 -0800 2017,Tue Jan 10 11:34:21 -0800 2017,Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 -0800 2017,,1,0

 Charlie Sutton is the newly out, 27 year old owner of one of the largest cattle ranches in Australia. He's in complete and total love with Travis Craig, a Texas born and raised agronomy student who came to Sutton Station six months ago to complete an internship...and he never left. Charlie never imagined finding a man to love in their isolated part of the world, and now he can't imagine living without Travis. Book one of the series was their initial love story. Book two featured Charlie's coming out, and the struggle to keep Travis in Australia, despite immigration snafus. Book three is Charlie learning to love with an open heart, even if he loses Travis. Because it's a bigger story. It's about making a family of the people in your life, and building alliances and friendships that will stand the test of time and distance. 
 So, let's talk about the book. Charlie and Travis are doing great. Really. Charlie's become a surrogate mom to a baby wombat Travis rescued. It's adorable reading Charlie's gruff commentary about Nugget burrowing into his armpit and demanding to be fed by only him. Travis is tickled and jealous by turns. Charlie's up for an election to the board of the Beef Farmers' Association, and he's preparing to demonstrate his new farming tools, including solar collars for herd tracking and management. He's been using Travis' expertise to reduce antibiotic need and reduce wear-and-tear on the land. It's all very impressive to a new beef buyer who manages the purchase for a giant chain of restaurants--and both Travis and Charlie woo that line of profit. Professionally, things are going great for Charlie. And Travis. 
 Personally, they will be tested. Ma, the cook and compound chief--who helped raise Charlie after his own left mother when he was four--is ill. She's been so gruff and obstinate about it that everyone is leery of calling in the doc. Being three hours from the nearest town, though, Charlie can't take the agony of watching her wither. Learning she has cancer? Devastating. And that's not the end of Charlie's family problems. His missing mother even plays a role. And there's even more drama surrounding her re-introduction. 
 But, no. That's not even the biggest challenge. That comes in the form of Travis, and his family, and the absolute need for him to go back to Texas--Charlie is convinced forever. Forever has a different meaning for Travis, however. And man! I just love these guys to pieces. I held my breath and hoped to God and agonized through Charlie's angst. I cheered and swelled with pride. I Googled ""wombat"" so I could picture Nugget better. I fell face-first into the red dirt and had my heart treated with all the care and consideration I've come to expect from Charlie and Travis. There's struggle here, and there's triumph over the challenges. And there's unexpected joy and there's a fantastic HEA that's so very tender. Readers who follow this series won't be let down in the slightest. It's been out for more than two years and has 4.5 Stars average rating over 1650 ratings/reviews.

 Navy SEAL Zach Nelson is a closeted gay man being tormented by one of his teammates, Cobb. He's trying to pass, and mostly does, but he fears even experimenting with a man--because he knows his family will never accept him. And, he's assured by Cobb that none of the guys in the squad will protect him if they find out he's gay. Vulnerable, he looks for off-base housing so he can escape Cobb's relentless haranguing. The senior chief of Zach's squad has a small three-bedroom house he wants to renovate, and offers Zach free rent if he'll do the work. 
 Zach struggles, however, as he's not a handy guy. His good friends Ryan and Josiah recommend a mutual friend, Pike, to stay and help. Pike had struggled to find a job out of grad school, and has accepted a visiting prof job at a community college in San Diego. He knows Zach's a sexually-confused man, but he's not really prepared to teach him the secrets of gay life--no matter how attracted he is to ""Muscles,"" er, Zach. No. See, Pike got burned falling for a guy who wouldn't come out before, and he's not interested in repeating the experience. 
 Thing is, the more Zach and Pike live together, the more these guys fill needs for the other. Zach cares for Pike's deranged cats. Pike is the handiest math genius in (perhaps) seventeen states. They get along far better than they had expected. And, there's sexytimes. Pike stands-in as gay Yoda to Zach, who's a frustrated, self-loathing virgin. I liked how they progressed from roommates to more, because it happened over the course of weeks-to-months. Zach's frustration with Cobb's bullying is palpable and gut-wrenching. His realization that he needs to be a better partner to Pike, when he finally accepts that they are more-than-friends, is really sweet. This is a good man, who's lived under very constrained personal relationships. His parents are very Southern, and very religious, and very disapproving. 
 Pike, on the other hand, does all he can to live his truth, without bringing any harm to Zach personally or professionally. He's a rock and a sweetheart, and a man who volunteers his heart for breaking, because Zach needs him. I really liked these guys, especially when Zach opened up about all the crap he was struggling with, not only to Pike, but to Ryan, and eventually to senior officers. There was some quelling of the homophobic comments on the squad once one of Zach's teammates suspected his sexuality, and the handling of the bullying seemed to fit the situation. In the end, we get Pike and Zach out as a super solid couple, and I'm expecting gorgeous Lt. Apollo to find new love in one of the coming books. #Swoon.

 I really liked this one, because I really liked the characters. They felt very real to me, even making decisions that I felt were poor--out of a misguided sense for love or honor. 
 Cashel Godfrey and Leonidis Day are detectives in the Atlanta PD, and they mostly work to hunt down drug lords. They've been partners for four years, and get along really, really well. Day is out and proud, and ""God"" doesn't mind. He's a closet bisexual and has developed intense feelings for Day, while Day harbors what he believes is an unrequited crush. They work side-by-side and often spend evenings together. God's been hiding his really, horribly-dysfunctional family history from Day (and everyone) for years, and believes he's unlovable as a result. When God gets leveled by the flu, Day's his at-home nursemaid. And, Day contacts Genesis, God's younger half-brother which ends up being a catastrophic mess, and leads to God and Day having a falling out. 
 I'm really not stating it all as strongly as it happens in the book, because that was some messed up crap, and I might have gotten a little vicarious-PTSD in the reading. What remained, however, was the heartache, and neither God nor Day could cope in that fractured state. God made his move, and Day was completely bowled over. And there was lots and lots of sex. And some cop stuff. And fixing the lives of fellow cops who had separately bordered on harassment-status, to that point. And more sex, and a huge drug bust that went every-which-way instead of simply sideways, and Day was nearly killed and protocol was completely absent, and I still liked the book, because God and Day are really fun to ride along with. 
 Also, things got kinky, and new ""friends"" arrive on the sexy scene, and that might make some readers mad, but I was all ""if it feels good, boys"" and they went for it, and I liked it all the more. 
 The book is a pleasure read, with some really harrowing moments that only reinforced how special both these guys are to each other.

 Eddie Rodrigues is kicking himself bigtime for hanging out with his new boyfriend instead of following the Ren Faire folks south for the winter. But, the promise of a homecooked Thankisgiving meal with a good-looking man seemed too good to be true. Unfortunately, it was. 
 That's why Eddie took off. This time. He'd foolishly let himself believe he was worth more than the cast-offs he'd come to expect in life--since way before he left the foster care system. Naturally, because Eddie's life sucks, his boyfriend's car craps out on the highway halfway to Nowhere, and Eddie has to tramp through field and backroad through freezing slush until he reaches a town. Just as he's getting close to the bus station, he witnesses a girl get struck by a runaway car. It's near midnight, and he knows no one, but he can't leave her alone. His cries for help bring exactly that. Now, as the lone witness to the accident, the police officer in charge asks a friend to put Eddie up for the night so that she can question him in the morning. 
 Grayson Croft hasn't had a man in his home in more than a decade. He gave up on love when Brady left him behind for the big city. He works two months of the year, running The Christmas Shoppe, a seasonal store opened by Gray's grandmother. As it seems Eddie might need more than a single bed for a single night, Gray offers him a job at the shop. He can always use some help, and--learning that Eddie's a glassworker--he offers to sell any ornaments Eddie might make on consignment. 
 Eddie accepts because he's in a jam. During his travels his protective eyegear got smashed in his bag, and he doesn't have enough money to replace them. Without the dark-lensed glasses, he can't use his torch to bend glass. Thus, he's got no marketable skills for the next Ren Faire, and that's not acceptable. Gray buys the glasses as a part of the deal Eddie makes with him--and it's the first good turn Eddie's had in a long, long time. 
 Working in the Christmas Shoppe sets Eddie off thinking about his lonely life, and how he has no one in the world who really needs or knows him. It's somber, but it's not sad, because it's becoming clear that Gray is coming to depend upon him. THey work well together, and they have similar interests in hobbies--they both love to read, and enjoy quiet nights before a fire. It's so fun how Eddie teaches Gray to use his tidy fireplace, and how they pass cozy evenings on the sofa reading together. 
 That's not to say that there's no attraction; there is. Gray doesn't want to take advantage of Eddie, and Eddie thinks Gray doesn't want him. This does get resolved, nicely, and they each make the perilous emotional steps toward building something more. Eddie's craft is amenable the other seasons, and Gray has an empty shop after December. Could it be a studio? Could they possibly build a life together? 
 As first, Eddie's got a wandering soul, and Gray's not a traveler--but sometimes, for the right person--people are able to envision more than the world they've always known. It's an interesting juxtaposition, and Gray isn't quite ready to take the necessary steps when he needs to, but that doesn't mean he's incapable. Expect some drama regarding small-town values, hit-and-run drivers and an orphan with a leave-first mentality. Also, sexytimes before a fire, book-nerd discussions and one sweet, sweet reunion.

 Toby is the junior librarian in his home town of Sandy Lake, Ohio. He's also one of two employees of this small-town library. His boss, Mr. Miggles, is the other. 
 He was the buttoned-up, tie wearing, head librarian and my boss. He acted older than he actually was. He was probably in his thirties but he dressed up everyday in a suit and tie...He was always serious, often sad, and he had an ageless, professorial thing going on. I thought of him as the Socratic ninja of the Sandy Lake Library. He moved around stealthily, getting invisible shit done. And when he did speak, he sounded like he was reading from one of the high-brow books he loved. 
 It was kind of awesome. 
 My role, on the other hand, was to be the smart, hip, and mildly jaded young employee. I played it to perfection, if I do say so myself. 
 Mr. Miggles is an enigma to Toby. And that's cool. I mean, Toby has a hot boyfriend, Justin, who, you know, borrows money without paying it back, and never pays his share, and hardly goes out to do anything with Toby that could possibly be a ""date"" but. Yeah. 
 We learn early that Christmas is fast approaching, and Mr. Miggles is a man who loves Christmas, despite having no discernible family or friends. Still, he relishes dressing up the library with decorations, and putting out the Christmas Surprise Box, a prize that--Toby notices--gets lots of raffle entries, despite the modest $50 contents. 
 Right about this time little Tanya Lemmens begins getting dumped at the library. She's maybe five years old, and her single mother, Anita, may actually be looking for a job, but it's still irresponsible of her to simply drop the child off and run. Mr. Miggles makes it his mission to entertain withdrawn and likely malnourished Tanya. Despite Toby's requests to call Child Protective Services, Mr. Miggles acts as a surrogate parent for days--until he spots the bruises. 
 What seems to be an open-and-shut case of neglect and abuse gets turned around, with Mr. Miggles under investigation. Why would a single man take charge of such a young girl? Was he ever alone with her? Some of his tragic past gets twisted and leaked to the local paper to paint this compassionate, conscientious man as possibly predatory. 
 Toby's beside himself. In his role as sole librarian, while Mr. Miggles is held for questioning and later released but banned from work, Toby learns all about Mr. Miggles' side work for the library. How there are several down-on-their luck regular library patrons who ""win"" the single Surprise box every year. How that crafty, ninja librarian, Mr. Miggles, also got special books for his patrons, including expensive large-types for the elderly, and over-budget cancer books for the newly-diagnosed, and made weekly visits on his off-time to shut-in nursing home patients as part of yet-another unfunded ""outreach program"" that only he knows about. Toby fairly swoons learning he'd invested his salary over and over again, to the benefit of the Sandy Lake community. The more Toby learns, the more he knows he has to do something to save Mr. Miggles' job. Because Sandy Lake won't be the same without him. (Oh, and because Toby's half madly in love with his erudite, tweedy boss...) 
 This is a book about small-town politics and small-town compassion, which are, unfortunately, at odds. Mr. Miggles is a good man caught in a crossfire of prejudice and politics. It's also unfortunate that Mr. Miggles has been so private; because he's kept so many secrets it's hard to mount a defense, at first. Still, he has many fans in the community, and Toby's determination knows no boundaries. All this esteem tips over into the attraction category--long before Toby even knows Mr. Miggles is a gay man, mourning a tragedy he left behind in LA. 
 The way this community circles it's wagons for Mr. Miggles is really something special. Toby won't let Mr. Miggles give up without a fight, and his reaction to Toby's offensive is nothing less than tear-worthy. The book is a different type of romance. There's no dating, or wooing. There is simply Toby helping his dear boss, and developing an attraction he'd not expected to have reciprocated--but it was. Expect just a bit of sexytimes mostly near the end, and whoo-boy! To be a fly on the wall of the Mysteries section of the library that evening!! O.O

He's twenty-three and six months clean of his heroin addiction, after his best pal, Jamie, saved him from an overdose. Jamie's still using, and hooking, disappearing from their flat for benders that last days on end. One night Zac spots Liam hanging outside a bar and decides to entice him into a trick. Liam's a bit older, clearly wealthy, and bloody gorgeous, but the reason Zac marks him is the dead look in his eyes; Zac's familiar with that ""checked out"" look. 
 Liam Mallaney hasn't been with another man since his beloved husband, Cory, died in a wreck. Over those nearly two years, Liam had to assume full control over their company, leaving his art director position behind. Despite living within a mile of his twin sister's family and also his father's home, Liam's a virtual hermit. His constant comfort are two Labradoodles that nudge him out to the beach for their walks. Meeting beautiful and nubile Zac is a chance event, and he's willing to pay for some no-strings, one-off sex to calm the void of grief in his chest for an hour, or so. 
 Their chemistry is electric, and Zac's so shell-shocked he gives Liam a card with his personal number, hoping Liam might become a regular. Thing is, Liam's not just interested in sex. He needs companionship, too. And he hires Zac to be a companion--as well as a lover. In their few trysts, Liam begins to thaw his frozen heart, wondering about Zac, and if he could convince him to try working as something other than a rentboy. Zac's gone over Liam by their second meeting, and wishes he was more, someone suitable for kind and compassionate Liam to cherish. But, he isn't. And, Jamie sees Zac's pain over it immediately. Things between Zac and Jamie have been complicated since Zac got clean, but Jamie's addiction is reaching critical mass; he's clearly getting too far into the scene to get help, but--beyond that--Jamie's bringing trouble home. 
 While Zac and Liam figure out what they want from the other, Jamie's problems land Zac in a dangerous situation--that's what happens when your vindictive drug dealer shows up looking for his money. Jamie does the right thing, but it's not the end of the drama, for Liam or Zac. Still, it brings them together, and gets Jamie the help he needs, both legally and medically. 
 There's a bit of angst here, with Zac unsettled by his attraction for a john. He's not the sentimental sort, and struggles maintaining the proper boundaries--which is heart breaking. Liam's a good man, but he doesn't know how, or if, he can love again. And, should he really fall for a hooker? It's kind of shocking to Liam when he decides that answer isn't NO. There's other issues at play--notably Liam's father experiencing dementia, Zac's struggle to stay clean, and Liam's crushing depression--but those are a small part of the building romance. As we've got a rentboy-romance, expect lots of sexytimes. For all the steam, there's tons of tenderness, too.

 Michael Rodriguez and Nunzio Medici have been friends for two decades. They grew up in South Jamaica, Queens, and now teach in a queer-friendly high school in Brooklyn. They are both gay, but only Nunzio is out. Michael has hid it all these years. Out celebrating their last weekend before the school year begins, they go clubbing and bring home a sexy third to play with--this is new. Michael and Nunzio have never had sex together, but that night is the first step on a journey Nunzio's wanted to make for a long time. 
 As Michael deals with his mixed-up attraction for Nunzio, his estranged, homophobic, alcoholic father returns to their family home...to die. He's terminally ill with liver disease and spending his final months drinking the rest of his disability pay away. It's a struggle for Michael to manage his dad, Nunzio and his younger brother, Ray. Plus, his new team leader at school is a problem. David--as well-meaning as he is--is driving a wedge between Michael and Nunzio. 
 All of this pressure leads Michael to alcoholism and taking more and more of his anti-anxiety meds. It's a tricky balance being sober. His father's death is the final straw, and sends Michael hurtling over the edge of depression. 
 This is a tough, realistic story, that has a lot of soul-searching and come-to-Jesus moments. It's raw, and gritty, and not very pretty most of the time, but that reality, and it's everyday pain, is also fantastic. Expect to break down with Michael, to suffer and learn to do the right thing--for himself and those he loves. There's a point where he accepts that he has to fight for those he loves, and the fight includes caring for himself. He has a lot of self-loathing, due to his father's homophobia. I was so glad that Ray, Nunzio and David were by his side, when they could be. 
 The end is sweet, and tender, and all the happiness that Micheal's ever longed for, even if he didn't know how to ask for it.

 Alfie Bell is a big beast of a man, nearly thirty and only recognized his gayness two years ago. He's from the north Atlantic coast of England, a rundown beach village called South Shields. Having been smart he did his schooling, got a masters and took a job in investment banking. He's fabulously wealthy, living his openly gay life in London, and quietly caring for his family up north. He's had a falling out with them, over his sexuality, and he really wants everything to be normal in his life. He wants a committed relationship, and a family some day. His ambitions are much simpler than his profession might indicate. And, ultimately, Alfie's been feeling rather empty of late, wishing he had stronger connections and feeling disenchanted with London's shiny veneer. 
 While on a rare trip home, Alfie inadvertently outs himself to his best friend--while at his wedding. It's a mortifying event, and Alfie takes a drive to clear his discomfort. Popping in to a nearby bar, Alfie spots a slight, slim man with silver-blonde pink tipped hair and the most gorgeous body...ever. He offers to buy the man a drink, and the reaction he gets is not welcome. Fen, as he calls himself, doesn't believe that a strapping man would ever find him sexually attractive, but they do get on with an interesting evening adventure--which turns out really good, as far as Alfie is concerned. Until Fen reveals his full identity the next morning--that Fen was the shy gay boy that Alfie and his mates all tormented throughout grade school. Alfie's world shifts. He's not the same uncouth boy who did those horrible things, and those memories are terrifying related through Fen's point-of-view. 
 When he returns to London, Alfie simmers on this new development. He's filled with shame, and wants to make amends however he can. He books some time off to make the long trip north again, and turns up at Fen's business--a flower shop called Pansies that used to belong to his late grandmother and mother. Life hasn't gone to Fen's plan much; he's only running the shop (into the ground) out of grief for his mother's early death. It's a way of connecting to her, even as it meant giving up his own career, breaking it off from his boyfriend, and losing his half of their mortgaged flat. Alfie knows none of this, he only wants to be near Fen. The encounter isn't much better than their recent meeting, ending with a comic spectacle in Fen's run-down bath that requires repairs. Alfie, always the fixer, attempts to make that right, too. And ends up needing his own rescue. From his estranged family. 
 Fen, honestly, has a very conflicted experience with his former tormentor. He was bizarrely attracted to Alfie as a teen. He was so strong, and sure, and manly, yet still had a softer side, like rescuing trapped butterflies. Seeing Alfie so committed to helping him in his suffering now is turning all the right switches, awakening long-buried attraction. Alfie is tender and compliant in a way Fen had imagined in his deepest adolescent fantasies--you know the type: getting one over on your nemesis, only with sexytimes. 
 As they spend time together, Alfie recognizes that he's really falling for Fen. He also loves the idea of being back home. There's so much familiarity, and he envisions being a partner to Fen in more than just Fen's broke-down futon. He convinces Fen to let him look over his finances and help with the flower shop. It's not easy for Fen to let go--and Alfie's continually blundering when it comes to the homophobic incidents that they keep getting involved in. See, Fen's not even gay, exactly, (probably pansexual though Fen calls himself queer) and yet he endured a lifetime of teasing and abuse for his queerness. And, Alfie's only been out in London, where there's less of an in-your-face homophobia. He can't bear to have himself and Fen called out for just existing. It's all very chilling, for Fen. He wants a lover, not a felon--and he knows how dangerous it can be to engage with homophobes in groups. Plus, part of Alfie's issue is his own internalized homophobia. Fen helps him to tease apart all the ""masc"" constructs that have really been lead weight surrounding his neck for thirty years. Alfie is so utterly vulnerable, and deeply in love with Fen after a couple of weeks--and that's when it's got to end. 
 Fen's not meant to stay in South Shields, nursing his memories for a dead mother--even his father thinks so. And, while Alfie would be happy to give up his posh London life and build a new one with Fen, Alfie's pretty-well decided he wants to do it in his hometown. It's not fair!! There's a kerfuffle, and a break, and more grand gestures to win Fen back--and I can't actually do any justice at all to this without giving away too much. The book is so lush, and the writing so lyrical. I've never been to England, and yet I feel like I moved into Fen's shop, and got insulted by Gothshelley, and ate finger-burning chips on the beach and curried paneer at Raj's Indian restaurant. I could see the spun silk of Fen's silver-pink-blonde hair, and hear the creak of pain in Alfie's voice when he tried, once again, to connect with his baffled father. There's an all-encompassing accessibility to Alfie's point-of-view that absolutely dropped me into his brain, and his experience. His youthful regrets are intense, and his determination to quietly fix all and sundry is unquestionably endearing. The book has a sweet HEA that is sure to please any romance fan.

 Hollis Alcott and Sawyer Murphy have known each other since middle school. They are both halves of a twin, and Hollis' sister Char was besties with Sawyer through high school--and she married Sawyer's twin, Tucker, several years ago. 
 Hollis is a serious introvert, very uptight about his public and private life--even if he has none. Sawyer is out and proud, a braggart back in high school when he would casually relate all his exploits to Char, and Hollis, by default. He was too fearless, and too fanciful, for Hollis, even if Hollis couldn't help being swept away by Sawyer's gregarious nature. Still, too risky to even come out before he was on the other side of the US, gong to school on the east coast while his family lived in Portland, Oregon. 
 Three years ago Hollis and Char's parents died in a skiing accident, and they have dealt with it in their own way. Char's family lives in her childhood home, growing more offspring and engaging with life while Hollis runs his own carefully-curated craft paper, ink and pen shop. He's a fussy man, wanting to project the perfect image of perfection, while inside he's a neurotic wreck. He's still very much attracted to Sawyer, who runs a card and gift shop in the same Main Street business area as Hollis and pals from KNIT TIGHT, Ev and Brady's yarn and coffee shops. Hollis is a big fan of Ev's knitted scarves, and those come in really handy when Sawyer gets his lips on Hollis' very sensitive neck... #Hickeys!! 
 But first, the premise: Hollis is always down around the holidays, and their business association is running a window decorating contest to boost sales. Sawyer bets Hollis that his shop will come in top three, and if Hollis' store wins, he'll do some manual labor around the shop--but when Sawyer wins, it's a date night. 
 Hollis can't understand why Sawyer wants to play with him, but he's much too fragile to hand his heart over to a man who's been notorious for quitting everything. Sure, they're rolling up on thirty now, but Sawyer's still too brilliant a light for Hollis to look into often. He's scared, having little-to-no experience in relationships, yet Sawyer is a patient, and persistent force. Plus, their familial and business connections continue to wrap them together, even when Hollis would rather run for the hills. 
 That said, Sawyer's thrilled by the little bit of kink he susses out of Hollis' reactions. It seems Hollis really likes a bit of dominance, and rope bondage. Oh, and some orgasm denial. Yes, our buttoned-up fusspot Hollis is dirty dirty boy, when he feels safe enough to let himself play with a partner. Their deep connection and the rekindling of their friendship allows Hollis to let go with Sawyer. Sawyer's so grateful for this kinky peek into a man he's wanted for years. They get it on for a bit--until Hollis' complete paranoia regarding Sawyer's motives finally kicks in. 
 This is a really sweet book. Lots of hurt/comfort for Hollis, and a heart-to-heart moment with his ghosts, to remember that he's a good guy who deserves far better than the grief-shrouded, showplace home of a life he's built for himself. Only when he opens his door to Sawyer's big love and hearty plans does Hollis recognize that his memories don't all have to be blanketed in sorrow, and that new experiences can be as lush as the life he once had. 
 It's a quick read, with great guys--and nice cameos from Ev, mostly, of KNIT TIGHT. Expect a heartwarming read, with a solid HEA. Also, a nosy cat, and a couple moments that might require a tissue. (Pretty much universal for me and Christmas reads...)

 This is the second book in a series, and is probably best enjoyed when read in order. Raymond Rodriguez is a 26 y/o Puerto Rican man in Queens just holding on to life. He's the youngest of two boys, and his elder brother Michael is a semi-closeted gay man. Michael wants to live with his best-friend/lover Nunzio, but he can't make rent on the apartment and pay his half of the mortgage on their late-mother's home. So, Michael tells Ray he needs to move out so they can clean up the house and rent it. 
 Ray's always been shiftless. He's an habitual pot smoker, and just got fired from his Longshoreman gig because he didn't show up, or answer calls for work. Mostly because he was high. He's not a bad guy, really, but he comes from a place where no one expects anything, and he didn't expect anything from himself. He's a man-child, and Michael's tired of floating him along. Adrift, Ray can't deal, but his close friendship with David--a teacher in Michael's school who's become a confidant--gives him some hope. See, David's a sweet guy, small, and twinkish, and out and friendly. David has an idea: they should live together. 
 Ray's not opposed. He's had bicurious feelings for a while, and he likes how David looks at him, how David cares for him. Ray's comforted by David's enthusiasm, and his nearness--they often cuddle, even if it's all platonic. But, that's not all either man really wants it to be. David has had a not-so-secret crush on Ray from the start, and their moving in together brings all of this to a boil. Still, it's not easy. Because David's fell for straight boys before, and gotten burned. What if he loses his heart to Ray, who decides he's done experimenting after a few go-arounds? David has an on-again-off-again thing with Caleb, a rich white slightly-older man, but it's not fitting him at all. While they look great on paper, there's no chemistry, and Caleb's sexual appetite isn't in the same hemisphere as David's. Caleb's moving on David, and being kinda wrong to Ray--in his own house no less, but what David and Ray had started is too tenuous for either of them to really commit to. It's a real rush to see the levels of their jealousy, as each tries to figure out what to do, and whom to do it with. 
 Add to this mess Ray's insecurity. He's an uneducated, barely-scratching-by Puerto Rican. He did find a job, but he hates it, and doesn't know how to move into a career. David's this shiny teacher with a good degree and loads of potential. His wealthy boyfriend is always sniffing around, and Ray's sure David will move on when he's done slumming. Ray's brother and Nunzio stick their noses in, pretty much warning Ray not to get involved with David--they have their own complicated history which involves a drunken one-nighter and awkward work history. 
 There's a lot of confusion, and hurt feelings as these two knock around trying to make it happen. I had read FIRST AND FIRST already, so I already knew how things were bad between David and Caleb, and why they really weren't a good fit for each other. Life for Ray and David is nothing but complicated. Ray is surly and a serious introvert, he struggles with authority, after having an abusive drunk for an absentee father. This is a big clash from David, who's very outgoing, a little snarky, but a fixer. Ray struggles with David discussing their personal life with his friends, and really doesn't like to examine himself, or deal with David's examination, either. David's in absolute fear that Ray will never come out, as a bisexual even, and David will remain a dirty, closeted secret--mostly because Ray's brother lives two lives, keeping his gay relationship from his entire extended family. It's a future that David can't envision, no matter how off-the-charts emotionally and sexually satisfying it is to finally be with Ray. 
 The end comes with some hard truths, as Ray would say. It's time to grow up, and own himself--and he does this even before the big blow-out with Caleb. I loved how Ray fixed his head, and followed his heart, and how David made better choices and stopped fretting. He's a bit of a mess, and that's still true in their next book, but he's an acceptable mess. The kind of neurotic that can be endearing, and is really born from standing up for himself, and his right to be loved honestly. There's a Happy For Now ending, I think, but it's certainly upbeat and honest. All the books I've read from this author have that quasi-HEA where the reader knows: these guys are all going to make it, even without the rainbows and rose bouquets. They're sturdy and dependable, and honest, even a dope-smoking man-child. He gets it right in the end, and I really enjoyed watching that happen.",Mon Oct 24 07:16:03 -0700 2016,Mon Oct 24 07:17:10 -0700 2016,Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,2,0

 Ray and David have been dating on the down-low for a year. Ray came out as bisexual on Valentine's Day, but only to close friends and his brother, Michael. David struggles to feel his place at Ray's side, mostly because the uber-slacker Ray has completely flipped his script and is working two jobs, plus going to college. He wants to be a supervisor, or an inspector, on the docks, so he's putting in third shift duty as a Longshoreman, in addition to his vapid day job. Most nights David goes to bed alone, after worrying that he and Ray are slipping apart. It doesn't help that Ray's new work pal, Trey, seems to want a piece of Ray--and Ray is completely oblivious. 
 Is David being silly, and suspicious, for no reason? David's only adult relationship was with Caleb, and he snuck around cheating because Caleb had little-to-no interest in sex. Now, David's worried that he and Ray are slipping apart, and Ray's so gorgeous he might be getting it on with any of the many male, or female, admirers he seems to collect. So, David's a wreck, imagining his worn-out lover might be taking some love on the side. Meanwhile, Ray's so exhausted, his libido has shrunk considerably. That doesn't mean he doesn't want David; he does. Lots. But they are ships passing, and both are banking on spending some great quality time on a gay-friendly cruise arranged by Caleb's new company. Ray has promised he'll quit his day job, but a bad financial turn causes him to change his mind--and keep that knowledge to himself until they get back from vacation. 
 It's a tenuous time, and both David and Ray are frustrated. David is drinking more, and it's upsetting to Ray--not least because David is obnoxious when drunk. Ray takes it in stride, guilty that he's neglected his lover so much. He thinks if he just works more, and makes enough money to manage his new expenses for a little longer, he and David can weather the storm. But David wants a true partnership. He's not happy being 'just friends' around any of Ray's work colleagues--and Trey's encroachment into their personal time is more than David can handle. 
 There's a lot of struggle in this book, and part of it stems from Ray's naivete. He's never dated anyone seriously, and David's experience in coupling hasn't been stellar. Ray still wants to keep his personal life private, and he doesn't see how this is a problem for David. There's also some eye-opening business that David experiences, notably the differences in treatment Ray gets from police due to his Puerto Rican heritage. David knows he loves Ray, and that Ray loves him, but love didn't keep him from stepping out on Caleb, or from all his other friends' having problems in their marriages. David looks at Michael and Nunzio--Ray's brother and lover--sees all he wants in the world: a strong, out relationship that is a partnership. There's so little of that happening between him and Ray that he's distraught. 
 These books, where the couple has been together a while but is hitting a rough patch, are always hard to write, and read. It's a delicate balance between the conflict and the resolution, because you don't want one character to be embittered, or seem unsympathetic. I felt like this was well-managed. Ray's still very clueless about how to be in a relationship, and David's got a lot of paranoia regarding his own missteps with Caleb. The opposite of love isn't hate, it's apathy, and David fears Ray's gone apathetic. Ray's mostly confused, determined to fix all his problems by working harder--which only causes his problems to spiral out of control. It's hard to get mad at a guy trying so hard, but I could empathize with David, who became more withdrawn and remote, feeling abandoned by the love of his life. 
 Expect angst and conflict for Ray and David. Expect them to battle, for love and attention. There's a good amount of love, and that core is solid--if only they can make it work. Spoiler alert: this one ends with a secure HEA. Ray and David finally do the sitting down, talking thing, and they compromise and they build a better love for each other than they had at the start.

He's never met the man he'll be an assistant to, but the pay is substantial and the contract is for a single year. He wants to help pay some of his mother's bills now that his father recently passed--and he feels a bit inadequate compared with his elder siblings who all went to professional schools, while he screwed around and got a ""go nowhere"" degree. 
 Sara's not so pleased when it turns out his employer lives in a rundown bayou house in the midst of the swamp. And his employer, Mr. Thaddeus Dupont doesn't want him there. All Sara can think is it's because Mr. Dupont doesn't want a gay man living with him, but he soon realizes that Mr. Dupont is a man unlike any he's met before. 
 I mean, really, has anyone ever heard of a gay vampire monk? 
 This book seems like it would be lighthearted, or at least kooky-spooky, but it's really an awesome paranormal thriller/romance. Thad has devoted his last 85 years to being an agent of death for demons the Catholic church can't eradicate. He works within a shadowy organization, the White Monks, who kill demons, and he's their back-up plan when it gets ugly. Thad does this, and maintains his celibacy, in order to redeem his soul. A devout Catholic, Thad wants the chance at an Afterlife, but being so close to Sara is an excruciating temptation. Sara is meant to be his food source. Thad can survive on small droughts of blood, but he only wants female vessels because they don't arouse him. Plus, Thad's compulsion powers don't seem to work very well on Sara. Sara's invading Thad's mind, too, which is deeply unsettling. 
 Thad hasn't seen so much demon activity...ever, and the called ones are particularly interested in Thad. Why? Who's calling them, and how does this guy know so much about Thad's ancient history? The demons strike close to Thad's core, kidnapping his daytime agent, Nohea, and attacking Sara. Meanwhile, the ghost of Thad's only lover, Leo, has come a-calling and the message is not good: the person controlling the demon activity wants Thad to turn him into a vampire. 
 The interplay between Sara and Thad is really a yummy build up of emotional and sexual tension. Sara isn't best-pleased to learn he signed up to be a year-long feast for Thad, yet he's paradoxically miffed when Thad won't drink from him. Is it because he's a dude? Is it the gay thing? Because Sara finds Thad to be very attractive, and his esteem grows by leaps and bound when he sees Thad in action, fighting and destroying the demons. Soon, he feels honored, not obliged, to offer himself for Thad's use--and that doesn't just mean as a blood snack. Thad's inner reserve is great, but he cannot resist beautiful, sultry Sara for too long. He also can't help feeling guilty afterward. 
 I loved the intertwining of religion here, because Sara is a nominal Hindu. He didn't really practice the religion, but he knows some of the ancient tales, and begins a little bit of practice as a center for his own concept of soul--following Thad's example. It was cool how this came to be important at the climax, and I really enjoyed the inter-racial and interfaith aspects of the book. 
 It's a little different take on the vampire mythos, but a nice change for the paranormal fan. There's more action than romance, but the tension is great, the plot quickly-paced and the hope that Thad and Sara can make something beautiful come from their odd-couple connection is also high. There are also elements of humor that are totally fun. Sara's a dead-pan kinda guy, and Thad hasn't had so much leavity in his life in a long, long time. I really loved how determined Thad was to keep human fatalities to a minimum, and how reverent he felt about Sara. He's a good man who got caught in a bad way. What was also sweet was the position the White Monks took to the advent of Sara, and Thad breaking his celibacy vow. The story ends, but the series has just begun. Very excited to follow along!

 Madeline is a college senior when she's apprehended for a foolhardy attempt at releasing scientific lab animals from a pharma company. While being the First Daughter comes with lots of responsibility, perks include getting pulled out of a jam without any real fuss. Well, to make amends she's ""requested"" to assist the agency that's helping returning war veterans get settled state-side. It wouldn't even be a hardship except she's working alongside beautiful, broken Jake Simmon, eldest son of Vice President Virginia Simmon. Let's just say that the VP does not approve of Maddie. 
 Jake, however, finds Maddie to be even more charming and beautiful than he'd thought before shipping out to Afghanistan. He's home now, and operating well with his prosthetic leg. He still suffers nightmares from the helicopter crash that claimed all his comrades, save one: Cyrus--who's adapting to a prosthetic leg and hand, and trying to help raise his growing family. Cyrus and his wife Kyla will move in to the very first home Jake, Maddie, and the team complete building, and Maddie's all extra-effort. It touches Jake, and he's finally empowered to do more than watch. Maddie and Jake can't fight the attraction, but they know they have to keep it somewhat quiet. There are always haters in the weeds, and one of them is Mama VP. She's used to wielding her political might, and she's threatened to prevent Maddie from helping out the lab animals, if she doesn't pass muster. 
 In the midst of this, we get an unfortunately up-close and personal look into Jake's PTSD, as well as what plagues Cyrus. Like many in this world, we don't see the inner darkness shielded by these battle-hardened men. It's a tragedy, and it breaks what's building between Jake and Maddie. 
 I really liked the considerate way that Maddie and Jake build their budding relationship. Maddie's a sweet girl, who really means well. She wants to fix problems, and save the world--and I'm not going to discuss the whole ""release the lab animals"" premise, because it's not a Real World option. Maddie does take advice to heart that enables her to help more than the few local animals that she may have ""helped"" (it's my experience as a scientist that such shenanigans are actually far more harmful, but I digress). And she wants to help Jake, and Cyrus + family, but mental illness/depression is a tricky foe. 
 Jake realizes that his life without Maddie really isn't as comfortable as it had been before he'd gone and done something ridiculous like fall in love. Some friends reach out and save him from himself, which is really awesome. Jake's a good guy, and he's had it rough for a long time, even before his injury. That said, getting help he wants isn't the easiest for a man whose mother controls so much power. The resolution was very sweet, and the reunion extra spicy. Lincoln bedroom anyone? 
 For a New Adult romance these two have tons of baggage, but they are strong enough to heft it well.

 Levi Grainger is a recent reality TV star hiking the Appalachian Trail in memory of his sister, Layla, an army gal who died on deployment. Levi idolized his elder sister, and it was her dream for them to hike the two thousand miles together. She'd planned and strategized and had tons of research on where to go and where to camp, and Levi's so adrift after her death that he hopes to connect with her spirit on the trail. 
 Who he connects with, however, is Thad, a strong, capable hiker who's as surly as a July day is long. Thad rarely speaks, but what he says to Levi is earth-shattering. That this behemoth of capability is gay is stunning to Levi. That Thad desires Levi is surprising to both men--Thad's demisexual. (On the spectrum, simply put, it means he only finds attraction to people with whom he emotionally connects. It's probably an oversimplification, but I'm accepting his words.) 
 While they traverse the tough terrain, Levi's overcome with grief over Layla, and he's not sure if he'll ever get over her loss. Plus, he's confused over Thad's interest, and Thad's tightly guarded words and past. Thad could go entire days without speaking, it seems, which is antithetical to cordial and chatty Levi. Their budding relationship explodes, however, because Thad's secrets can't be held back--and that breaks Levi's heart. 
 Unfortunately, it's also a moment of craptacular family problems, and Thad's Levi's rock through out the entire ordeal. Levi's forced to see Thad for more than his job, and that's a good thing. Thad has a real problem trusting people; his one and only boyfriend was a cheater. He doesnt' think Levi would do that, per se, but there's a big separation coming due to Thad's job, and it's the worst kind of scenario for Levi. Should they cut their losses before they get more attached? Thad thinsk so, but Levi's a scrapper, and he's willing to fight for the love he deserve, even if Thad doesnt' think he's able of giving it. 
 The tension and love her is so high! I fell into lock-step with these guys and loved every moment of their loving, and agonized every moment of their turmoil. Both Levi and Thad are great guys in a rough patch. There are bits of humor woven in, especially when Levi is recognized by fans at perhaps epicly bad moments, but that's so AWESOME. Because the book is intense. 
 I really enjoyed Levi and Thad's story, which felt raw and real and fantastic. There are other couples present in the end, and I'm sure they are from previous books which made the HEA more sweet for the series readers. For my part, I was captivated by this story, and would highly recommend.

 Jake Fitzgerald is a seasoned veteran catcher in the big leagues, and he's got a comfortable life playing for a team that's never in contention come October. While closeted, Jake has a casual arrangement with a married couple who enjoy a third now and again. He never has to worry about the only man he ever loved, his ex-best friend Brandon, who was long ago traded to Toronto. He doesn't have to worry at all, really. His mother has long encouraged him to come out and find a suitable life partner, but Jake doesn't want to get hurt, not like when Brandon found the love of his life and married her. Jake wants to go through the motions of life, hiding his heart and his true self from the limelight until he retires in a couple seasons. 
 Until he's traded to Ottawa. To a young expansion team hungry to make the playoffs and needing a cool head behind the plate to guide their hot-shot pitchers, especially Nico Agresta. 
 Nico is a rookie, having a stellar season on the mound, except for his temper. Once he loses control, even for a moment, he piles all his mistakes into an unscalable mountain. And, his casually homophobic father never lets up on Nico. A retired Hall of Famer, Al Agresta is ready with six comments on how Nico can improve his performance the second Nico steps off the mound. Nico's quietly grateful that he plays in Ottawa, and not Chicago like his elder brother, just so he gets a break from their father's scrutiny. Not that Nico ever stops berating himself. For not being straight, or for being the reason his mother died. He's only more unsettled when Jake joins the team and begins working with him regularly. Jake was Nico's first crush--years ago Jake and Nico's brother played together, and Jake spent many a Sunday dinner at their house. It was natural for Jake to take Nico under his wing and help him with his fastball. Now, Nico's ashamed of all the fantasies he'd built around Jake as a horny teen--and he's mortified to find himself only more attracted as a grown, and sexually unsatisfied, man. He's been with lots of women, hoping to find one that would spark more than just a perfunctory release, but one smile from Jake has him panting. He can't escape his lust--which turns Nioc's anxiety setting up to 20. 
 Jake and Nico reconnect, and Jake can't help finding this all-grown version of Nico completely enticing. That he's a brat in the clubhouse isn't appealing however, and one incendiary moment burns both of their better sense to ashes. Nico's attitude needs immediate correction, and Jake's dominant hackles have been raised. The rest is whoa. 
 They know they can't mess around near the team, but the peace Nico gains when Jake takes control is more than he can give up. Expect a little bit of kink. Spanking, dominating, a little bondage. Reminded me of BULL DURHAM, how Annie gets Nuke to think of other things on the mound so he can just throw the ball. Jake doesn't make him ""respect the streak"" or anything. They develop a closeness that neither man had ever experienced before, even if it's all behind closed doors. Even if it means Jake putting up with Al's homophobic tripe at a home-cooked dinner when Ottawa comes to Chi-Town. 
 I absolutely loved the slow burn, and multi-layered characters. Al's not a bad guy--he's antiquated and old school, think Yogi Berra with a chip on his shoulder. But, when he learns the truth of Nico and his sexuality, Al reconsiders. Al measures his words, and the impact they had on his youngest child. Al...changes. It's not miraculous, but there is improvement. And, when news breaks regarding Nico and Jake, well, Nico has his dad's love and fierce protection in a way he'd never dreamed possible. People talk about mama bears--Al Agresta is freaking grizzly. I also loved how Jake came to terms with his past mistakes, and mends the friendships he'd wounded in silence, and intent. I also really liked how his attitude changed regarding baseball. He started out jaded and willing to coast, but the season in Ottawa sparked his love of the game again. 
 I loved the book, because it felt real and wild. I do hope the MLB would support it's out players in the way Nico and Jake were, and fans would be as spectacular IRL as in fiction.",Mon Sep 26 04:59:11 -0700 2016,Mon Sep 26 06:30:05 -0700 2016,Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,1,0

 Zelda is a sixteen year old girl in turmoil. She's a native Aussie who's just returned to Australia after 10 months in NYC, where she's befriended Prim, a beautiful, caustic girl who is the object of Zel's affection. Their parting was less-that-optimal, and Zel's afraid that Prim hates her. Plus, she must adjust to life in Sydney, and a new school. Again. 
 Zel's a good girl, and she gets along with her parents. She has no friction regarding her lesbian sexuality, but she struggles to find appropriate targets for her crushes. It's a find line between friendship and more, she comes to realize, and she doesn't want to make the mistake she did with Prim. 
 She follows her cousin Antony's lead and takes Drama, though Zel's terrified of performing in front of an audience. In the class she meets Michael, Ashani and Stella, and they are all mates for the big performance production they have to script for the class project. Meanwhile, Zel works hard at her photography for Art class, the project there involving developing the many rolls of flim she used to capture subway rides and exploration days with Prim, back in NYC. See, they planned to ride each line to its end, and then see where that took them. There were only three lines left after Zel made her fateful mistake, and Prim didn't see her again before she moved. 
 Working with her partners is a challenge, but it becomes something really special, particularly the political action part of the performance. Zel's captivated by the challenges of refugees living in detention colonies, and how their sense of home is skewed from that of a citizen. Stella and Zel become close as their project winds on, and it's sweet to see how Zel misses most of the signs that Stella finds her attractive. Still, Zel needs to let go of her fascination with Prim, and that happens eventually, and in a way that was really tender. 
 I liked this YA romance because it really felt grounded in real life. There are no over-the-top grand gestures. Just ordinary kids muddling through and making emotional messes of themselves, before sweeping up the pieces and making it all work out. All the characters felt solid and present, and I enjoyed the by-plays and 'drama' of all the class drama. Don't expect any homophobia or tension regarding sexuality; these characters have solid support networks and courteous friends. Zel's parents adore her, and the feeling is mutual. 
 I also loved the attention to setting. Zel explores her new Sydney digs, as well as relates her New York explorations via flashback. I was really taken by the sweet vignettes of each locale and Zel's comparisons between them-and also her more sedate former home in Canberra. I felt transported via plane and subway to many places I've never been and others-like Coney Island-which I've visited, which is a big plus for me, as a reader. In short, it's a solid read, with the appropriate level of teen angst, and some sweet tenderness at the very end. It's an innocent book, with just a bit of kissing on the page.",Mon Sep 26 04:53:48 -0700 2016,Mon Sep 26 04:55:10 -0700 2016,Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,0,0

 Lane is a young closeted gay man who's on his own for the first time in his live. He's moved from Canada to Jacksonville, Florida to play for the Sea Storm, a minor league hockey team in a place where people hardly understand the concept of ice. It's a total culture shock, but Lane's generally flummoxed. He's got no filter, and is awkward to the point of /facepalm + Oh man!. He can't help pissing off everyone in his vicinity with his unconscious lack of tact. In a last ditch attempt to win some favor, Lane, a superlative forward and primo scorer takes on the goon for a rival team, Jared Shore. 
 Jared isn't sure what to make of young, virile, talented Lane. But he doesn't kick the man out of bed. TO be the only man that Lane's ever been with? Seems like an empty net opportunity, but he's also got to learn to tune out Lane's odd chatter, at times. Lane's ashamed of being gay, afraid that his parents will disown him--something he really struggles with even though he's supporting himself now. Jared helps him to see that being an adult means coming clean with his fears and insecurities, and that helps Lane grow as a man and a player. It's all good preparation for Lane when he gets The Call bringing him up to the big time, a few games in the NHL. Jared's an amazing support and together they are able to deal with Lanes parents. I have to admit that was so much sweeter than I had expected. Poor Lane, he tortured himself for so long, and for no reason! I loved Lane, even when I wanted to smack him. He did crack me up with his completely outrageous conversations. 
 This is a very tender read, considering the guys are grown adult hockey players. I loved how the romance built a little at a time, as Lane and Jared are players on different teams and have lots of forced separations due to schedules. It made their brief trysts so much sweeter, and that was really fun to experience. Also fun? Lane and his new sexual experiences! I do love me a virgin, from time to time. I'm not a hockey fan at all, but this one put me in a smiling frame-of-mind and gave me warm feels despite all that ice.",Tue Sep 06 12:40:24 -0700 2016,Tue Sep 06 12:41:44 -0700 2016,Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,0,0

They hit it off, and Josiah is thrilled to meet such a sexy, gay man, who also loves gaming. Ryan is a Navy SEAL on his way to get fitted for his new legs so he can re-take his life in active duty as an instructor--or so he hopes. Josiah is a fun and flirty seat-mate, but Ryan's frustrated that young, cute Josiah didn't even notice that he's a double amputee. Or, so he thinks. 
 When the flight gets diverted due to a blizzard, Ryan offers Josiah a bed in his hotel room. Turns out that's the only bed. And, while that's totally cool, it's not really romantic. Not for Ryan, who feels awkward about his stumps and still suffers acute phantom limb pain. But Josiah's a sweet guy, and they make a little magic happen. While Ryan's ready to walk away the next morning, even after their late-night gaming camaraderie, he realizes that Josiah--headed for a big meeting in Germany--left one of his laptops behind. Thus begins a sweet connection between Josiah and Ryan. Over the three week separation, they game together, they message each other, and they build a rapport neither expected. 
 Josiah hoped, of course, but he's a young, flighty guy on a cocktail of meds for his ADHD. What would a serious, muscular, sexy Navy SEAL see in him? Still, he's being challenged at work to run his own team, and it's stressful. Being able to confide in Ryan is therapeutic, and Ryan feels the same. He can't talk to his fellow amputees or therapists about his struggles to adapt to life on prosthetic legs because he still hopes to remain in active duty. And, his family is still overwrought with grief over his injuries to be helpful. Ryan is determined to never be a burden, and this makes it hard for him to fully engage with anyone, especially Josiah. 
 They meet again, a few weeks later, when Josiah stops over in DC to collect his computer and spends a few days visiting with Ryan. Their time together is sweet, and a little sexy. They make plans for another visit when Ryan returns to LA for a family party. Meanwhile, they keep in touch through phone calls and messaging. And, by little fits and starts, their romance blossoms. Josiah learns to take charge of his life, his work and his relationships, and Ryan learns being vulnerable allows a deeper connection to be made. Each man struggles--Josiah emotionally, Ryan physically and emotionally--but the end result is a tender love. They have some sweet and spicy sexytimes when all is said and done, and it's definitely an HEA for this gamer and his SEAL.

 Maguire was eleven when the car she rode in went off a mountainside and her father, uncle and brother were all killed. She was twelve when she rode a rollercoaster that went off the track, seriously injuring all 19 other passengers beside herself. She was thirteen when she went to a slumber party where every other guest ended up with gut-clenching illness. And six weeks ago, her abandoned candle burned down the neighbors' house. Maguire believes that she's Really Bad Luck, and she has a notebook filled with instances and coincidences that back up this claim. 
 Now sixteen and living in her third house in the past four years, preparing to enter her second high school, Maguire wishes she could just be home-schooled. She doesn't want to make any friends, and potentially be responsible for any of them getting hurt, or worse. Worried about Maguire, her mother insists that she attend therapy, and this is where the book opens, in a therapy session between Maguire and Dr. Leed. When the hour is up, Maguire notices the tall, attractive boy who enters the office in her stead. This boy, Jordy, reaches out to prickly, unapproachable Maguire as part of his own ""homework"" for therapy. And, they sort of hit it off. Maguire learns that Jory is semi-famous, but none of that seems to matter and Jordy appreciates that. 
 Inspired by Jordy, and knowing that she needs to get over her many phobias if she's going to fly to Ireland with her mother for a five year memorial for her father, uncle and brother, Maguire actually begins to engage in her therapy. She's terrified of riding in cars with people, using public transit, being out in public, going to parties, and has terrors imagining a bus ride, let alone a trans-Atlantic flight. So, with Dr. Leed's help, Maguire sets her own list of ""homework"" so that she can reclaim her life and defeat the sinister powers of the Universe that have ripped so much from her. 
 Along the way, Maguire joins her high school tennis team, where she makes real friends for the first time in years. She also connects with Jordy, who is happy to help Maguire in any way he can--even if it means crossing his parents. See, Jordy IS a big deal; he's a tennis wunderkind all set to go pro, if he can finish high school and stand up against his parent's plans for college. And, maybe, he and Maguire may become more than friends... 
 This is a bittersweet read, because Maguire is a kid trapped by tragedy. She has a loving mother, step-father and new step siblings, but she dwells in the past. She's terrified of her own mystique: believing that she's cursed. By really engaging with her therapy, and investigating the truth of her situation, Maguire learns to overcome her anxiety, by reasonable measured steps and slowly escalating ""risk."" It was an affirming story, that realistically demonstrated how a kid struggling with several mental issues could overcome her fears by challenging herself in safe ways. I really liked that there weren't a ton of catty gals, or hecklers. I liked that Jordy was a stand-up guy, and that he never gave up on Maguire, even when she did hurt him, succumbing to her fears when he needed her most. Maguire's self-discovery wasn't all forward motion, which was also reasonable. She had backward steps and tough choices. She cried, and she healed, and she fretted, but she made it all happen. It takes courage to go on, and survivor's guilt was also likely a big factor in Maguire's self-isolation. 
 I really dug the whole arcane ""luck"" charms that Maguire built into a ritual, not for herself, but because she wanted to ensure the safety of those around her. It's rather ironic that she never wanted herself to be safe; she expected her bad luck really only affected those around her. Jordy was a great guy, and I liked how down-to-Earth he was. He's got a bright and shiny future all laid out, but agonizes about his people-pleasing tendencies, and the high likelihood of failing to set proper boundaries. These were reasonable issues for an athlete of his caliber, and his pathway through therapy was also interesting. 
 For a teen romance, this was really tame with only a few kisses, some dithering regarding embarking on an official relationship v. secretly dating. Those issues held real relevance for Jordy, as approached legal adulthood and struggled to assert his autonomy over that of his parents' wishes. In total, the book was a clean read with plenty of morbid reminiscences and a healthy portrayal of mild mental illness, teen relationships, and healing. 
 I'd wish Maguire luck, but I think she's learned that she makes her own.",Tue Aug 30 16:36:15 -0700 2016,Tue Aug 30 17:35:07 -0700 2016,Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,0,0

 So. I bought the hype, somewhat. I've read all the HP books with my eldest, nearly 20 years old now, and I couldn't resist this one, even though it's not a novel. It's a play. Expect stage directions and all if you pick it up. It's also not really a kid's story. Which is totally fine because the last three books, IMHO, were for elder readers-late teen to adult. How many ten year olds really want to slog through THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, after all? 
 That said, this book makes a distinct break because a large portion of the story is told from an adult POV, that of Harry Potter at ages 37-40. He's married with three children and one of his kids, the middle child Albus Severus Potter, is a misfit. Not only does Albus get sorted into Slytherin, his best friend is outcast Scorpius Malfoy, only child of Draco Malfoy. Albus struggles with his auspicious parentage, especially as he doesn't possess the fantastic gifts at wizardry of his father, or even his popular elder brother, James. Further, Albus and Harry have a very strained relationship. Harry struggles as a parent to Albus, but has no issues with James and Lily. It isolates Albus, even when Harry makes deliberate attempts, fruitless though they are, to connect. 
 Meanwhile, Scorpius is haunted by rumors that his father is truly Voldemort, and he's mercilessly harangued at Hogwarts. Albus stays by his side, and they develop a strong, true friendship. The plot gets very messy when a Time Turner is discovered by the Ministry of Magic. See, Time Turners are outlawed because changing the past is a BIG PROBLEM. And, the experimental Time Turner is able to bring people back far further than ever imagined. One person in particular, Amos Diggory, wants Harry to go back and save his lost son, Cedric. This cause, saving The Spare who was murdered in Harry's stead, becomes of prime importance for 14 year-old Albus. And he recruits Scorpius and Cedric's cousin, Delphi, to assist in stealing the Time Turner from his Aunt Hermione in order to pull off this daring rescue. 
 I think we all know this goes poorly. As all adults will opine, changing the past is fraught with collateral damage. And that's exactly what happens. While we're never eager to embrace the atrocities that have come to pass, we also know that undoing such things, say by murdering Hitler as a child or something, would lead to so many unforeseen consequences that our world would be irrevocably altered. So, the play, the story, embraces the worst of these outcomes, and builds real terror for Albus and Scorpius. It harkens to the adage ""No good deed goes unpunished,"" and we experience a great deal of punishment in this fiction-scape. 
 As an adult, I relished the nuances of the story. I expect many younger kids won't. They don't have the maturity to fully experience the adult POV, but so many of the readers of this series are adults, and I believe that those people are, like myself, well satisfied. Several themes are similar to all HP books: friendship saves the day, valor is a consequence of situation-not a goal to seek, and courage is being who you are, regardless of consequence. The old ties are strong, and new ties can be beneficial. It was rewarding, to me, to see Harry and Draco on the same side, openly, for the first time. I liked how all the pieces fit together, in the same way that they always have. I didn't feel as if I was wondering, much, and I liked the pacing of the story. I'm out of practice reading plays, but fell right in once I got started. In truth, it was refreshing not having the ponderous descriptions of setting bog me down, just this once. That said, I much prefer novels, on the whole. Though, in reality, this book would have been twice as big if it had been a novel. I was able to follow along with all the scene changes and implied emotive notes without any difficulty. Younger readers might struggle with the format, which is the sentiment I've gathered from those who have read the book already. 
 I really do not want to spoil the book, but it must be said that both Voldemort and his progeny are present on the page, albeit briefly. It's a bittersweet read with tons of action and a plot that satisfied.

A year later, his parents divorced. His sisters, Josie and Meredith, are still shattered by the loss. 
 Josie is a 37 year old first grade teacher. She's always been the pretty, party girl, and long suspected that Daniel was out on that icy December night to pick her up from a bar, where she'd been black-out intoxicated. She's been to Daniel's grave only once in fifteen years: the day of his funeral. Her relationship with Meredith has always been strained by sibling rivalry, but they are virtual strangers to each other at this point, their only true connection Josie's huge love for Harper, her niece. At this point, Josie's done looking for Mr. Right. She has good friends, a solid job and the only missing piece is a child of her own. She's considering single motherhood, very seriously. 
 Meredith's life is far different at 35 than she expected it to be. She's a lawyer, not an actress. She's living in her childhood home, with a veritable shrine to Daniel just down the hall. She's married to Nolan, Daniel's childhood best friend--and she's woefully insecure underneath her tough veneer. Did she accept Nolan's proposal on account of Daniel? Did Nolan propose out of some perverted sense of duty, or guilt? Does she even love her husband? She's in therapy, and trying to work things out, and struggling with the choices she feels she made out of duty rather than desire. And, she's jealous of Josie, who, she believes, rather selfishly always made her own way. 
 This book isn't a breeze read. It's filled with regret, remorse and recollection. Josie and Meredith tell the story with dual viewpoint, and it's tough to see how these good folks find themselves still so lost, fifteen years after Daniel's sudden death. I personally recognized certain elements from my own family in the aftermath of my Grandfather's death--where paths quickly changed and relationships soon soured. When beloved people, caught in a trap of mourning, made decisions they later regretted. So, I got that. I also recognized Meredith's deep unhappiness in her marriage--which I think a good number of people can relate with--for unhappiness within herself. I was shocked and satisfied with Nolan's take on it all. While the whole 'if you love someone, let them go' idea is still a little counter to the romance 'dogma', I think it mainly worked here. 
 Josie and Meredith have a lot of fences to mend, and I applauded the role of Gabe, Josie's best friend, for his unshakable support, and also speaking plainly to Meredith about her callous treatment of Josie. I think it's easy to dislike Meredith, because she's so cold and harried, and ungrateful for what seems a ""perfect"" life, but she's also incredibly human, and an approachable model of many working mothers. 
 The loss of one person, at the wrong time, often has far-reaching effects within a family. I've seen this happen in real life, and I deeply sympathized with the characters as a result. That made this book a far more difficult read, personally, for me. The marriage issues were also tough to take, as I know I've had similar introspection as Meredith. No one likes looking at a difficult reflection, after all. The book resolves in a way that makes it seem as if the ship has changed course and is bound for brighter shores. It's still a long journey toward healing, but the heading is right and the wind is fresh and strong. I really liked it, even if it didn't leave me glowing.",Thu Aug 25 06:15:31 -0700 2016,Thu Aug 25 06:16:54 -0700 2016,Mon Aug 22 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,0,0

That said, Book 1 of this series is so lovely I jumped straight into the sequel. I'd honestly binge-read them all if my life wasn't intruding on my reading. 
 So...Charlie Sutton is a 26 y/o cattle farmer operating Sutton Station in the middle of Autralia's Outback ever since his father died three years prior. He had a real clash with his homophobic father, and planned to never return to his birthright. The brutal landscape is host to red dirt, extreme heat, and flash flooding. Charlie's a closeted gay man, certain he'll spend his life alone and celibate. Though his station (think: ranch) is enormous, it's also hundreds of kilometers from the nearest town. No opportunities to meet a man to pique his interest. Plus, who would choose to live in such isolation? He has some dedicated hands on the station, but they're staff. His own mother left when he was a small child. 
 Travis Craig is not your typical Texas cowboy. He's booked a four-week stay at Sutton Station to study the harsh farming environment of Australia, and he's rarin' to go. Also, he's 23 y/o, and gorgeous. Charlie's mortified at how attractive he finds his new (temporary) employee. He's so overwrought about it, he starts treating Travis kinda badly--until Travis gets right into his face and lets Charlie know that his interest is not only noted, it's reciprocated. They begin a completely-on-the-down-low tryst, and it's so bittersweet. Charlie's falling hard for Travis, and saving up every single memory knowing that they only have a few weeks to share. Well, unless Travis gets his way, that is. 
 It's a beautiful romance with an HEA that's spectacular. Like I said, I jumped right into the second book, and--schedule willing--I'll finish the whole series in the next couple of weeks. If you've been wondering if you should to dive into this series, the answer is heck yeah. It brought me back to my Thorn Birds love affair, only because the setting is so fantastic. Plenty of lovin' going on here.

 Rob, Liam, Galen and Mia are four high-school seniors weeks before graduation. Liam and Rob are dating, and Liam is best friends with Mia, who is dating Galen. They sort-of get along. It's not easy because Rob is new to the group, and he's the one telling the story. Also, Galen is a goofy guy, and seems to get-off on teasing Liam and Rob, sexually. I mean this as: he has no shame flaunting his body and trying to arouse Liam and Rob, because he's a very good-looking guy. Mia thinks that's kinda funny, even if it's uncomfortable for Rob and Liam. 
 As a bonding experience, they take a weekend trip to Mia's family's remote cabin on the Olympic Peninsula three hours from their homes in Seattle. Getting there is an adventure. They stop in Marot, Wash and the town and folks are nothing less than eerie. Mia's family had sold some of their land, and it was clear-cut--making the townies hostile. Rob, the narrator throughout, is freaked out. The cabin's little more than a wreck, and so remote they need a satellite phone for emergency use. Which promptly goes missing. And, the outhouse explodes. And so many freaky things happen that Rob's SURE they are being stalked/hunted by the Marot weirdos. 
 This is a gothic mystery, and the fifth character in the story is truly setting. From oily-aired Seattle alleys and shady tattoo parlors to the constantly-dripping temperate rainforest with its startling, yet hidden, clear-cut patchwork, enveloping the cabin and teens, you can be sure that the settling is thick, overwhelming and troublesome. Remote, and desolate, with nothing but acres and acres of dangers and possibilities. I got chills, much the same as Rob described. 
 I honestly don't want to give away too much plot, but you can expect a whole lot of death and destruction in the story. Despite their bonding skinny-dips and fireside chats, the teens are a-dropping and Rob's frantic to escape this fate, by any means necessary. I didn't see the big twist, at all. Which was terribly refreshing. As I've read several of the author's books, this one marked a complete departure into gothic mystery/horror. What a fantastic addition to his library, really.

 4.5 Stars! 
 I really loved this slow-burning, friends-to-lovers, contemporary romance. 
 Angus and Brad have been together ten years. As Angus agonizes over turning thirty, Brad is increasingly distant. It doesn't help that he's been living in another town several days a week while teaching a 6-month photography class. Angus' best childhood friend, Reece, and Brad do not get along and Angus doesn't fit in with Brad's friends. 
 Reece hates the way Brad controls and demeans Angus. All of Angus' family, and Reece's family for that matter, have wanted Angus and Reece to be together. Reece is straight, but he loves Angus. A lot. And he's hidden that his initially ""brotherly"" type of love has matured into attraction. 
 At Angus' thirtieth birthday party, Brad shows up late, drunk, and stays only long enough to break up with Angus. The next day, Facebook explodes with the announcement of Brad's engagement to a 22-year-old Angus lookalike. It destroys Angus, who has been body-shamed by Brad for years. While holding Reece and his family at bay with excuses, Angus slides into depression. For months, he drinks away his pain, misses work, forgets to pay his rent, and ends up being evicted and laid off. 
 Reece gets wind of Angus' self-implosion and steps in. He can't believe he let Angus lie to him so completely regarding his mental state, and he's furious that Angus has suffered in silence so long. He cleans him up and bundles them into a rental car, road-trip necessary, destination unknown. 
 Over the course of roughly the next three weeks, Reece and Angus randomly choose locations in the U.S. to explore, no itinerary needed. Angus has no job, and Reece is a freelance editor, so they have plenty of time to reconnect, recharge, and reboot. Oh, and fall in love on what turns out to be a trip from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine. By way of California, the southwest, New Orleans, Nashville, DC, and the east coast. 
 This book is really a tender read. I deeply identified with Angus and his utter humiliation. He's mortified that his long-term, live-in boyfriend had cheated, but he's equally shamed that Brad's snooty friends must have known, and they looked him in the face and lied. That Brad had so little care for him after so many years together, years Angus now feels were wasted on a manipulative and mean partner, is devastating to his fragile self-esteem. Angus has age issues, feeling ""used up"" in his gay society, which he believes is youth-obsessed, and Brad's proposal to such a younger man feeds that insecurity. 
 Reece is a dedicated friend. He's a fixer, too. I loved how he didn't push Angus, much, once they were in the car. Unlike Brad, Reece wants Angus to make his own, healthy, decisions. He wants Angus better. He also wants Angus, but he's never made a move on a man. Reece's anxiety over doing the wrong thing for Angus is endearing; taking advantage of his suffering friend is not his style. Taking care of Angus is, however, and he makes so many of Angus' long-held desires come true. They hit Coachella--a huge music festival, they dance at gay bars on the Vegas strip, they talk, they sit in silence, they bond over Angus' teary confessions of loss. It's enough to break Angus from his funk, but it's also enough to awaken Angus to Reece's quiet affection. Brad had always been jealous of Reece's friendship, and Reece is finally honest that he longs for more than just friendship with Angus. 
 It's heady and terrifying. Angus has only just pulled himself together, and he absolutely cannot lose Reece. That would hurt worse than Brad's spectacular exit from his life. But, can he live without the love that Reece is offering him? 
 I really enjoyed this slow burn. I also loved the many locales that Reece and Angus explore. After the first day, or so, there's a bit of giddiness between them, an almost child-like excitement as they make up new plans on the fly. They nudge each other out of their comfort zones, and the progressive movement gives them each the courage to take the eventual and necessary step from friends to lovers. The book is an HEA, and even has the added bonus of coming full circle for Angus.",Fri Jul 29 12:10:48 -0700 2016,Fri Jul 29 12:12:37 -0700 2016,Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,1,0

 It's contemporary times, but it's also the end of times. The world was infected with a virus that has decimated the population and turned the infected into mindless zombies. Adam and Parker were students at Stanford, Adam a 23 y/o films studies grad student, and Parker an 18 y/o freshman in Adam's class when everything went bananas. They escaped California on Adam's motorcycle and headed east, to see if Parker's family survived the carnage. Along the way they were attacked, fell for each other, confessed some startling secrets, got over themselves, were held hostage, escaped from real and present dangers--many times--and hit the coast. Only to discover Parker's family long gone. 
 They bundled up and took off for safety in a yacht, and that's where Fight the Tide picks up. Parker and Adam are making their way south along the east coast. Parker is a trained sailor; his family owned a yacht and he sailed regularly in his childhood. That said, he's never made such a long trip without more skilled partners--his father and elder brother--and he knows going into the open ocean is a very dangerous prospect. Staying close to shore isn't easy either. It's nearing the end of hurricane season, but storms could disable their boat, or send it crashing to the shore. Being near the coast allows them to drop into port now and again to scavenge supplies. Adam, who is a werewolf, always makes these trips as he's immune to the virus, and his heightened strength and senses allow him to avoid or overcome any zombies that attack. That doesn't help Parker, alone on the boat, when pirates board. 
 Despite Parker's general wariness, he helps rescue a boat in a storm, picking up two adults and their kids. This companionship is mostly welcome, especially by Adam, who is a drifter and grateful for any pack he can cobble together. Adam and the other adults want to make sail for Salvation Island, a place not on any of Parker's maps, yet whose beacons come across the radio frequencies every evening. Parker's sure it's another trap, and is adamantly against, but circumstances force even his will--when he needs to get help for one of his passengers. 
 There is constant action in this book. It's a rollicking ride, with danger lurking from page-to-page. Parker isn't good with people, and his suspicious nature is bolstered with each new tragedy. He's also haunted by the pirate attack, and he's ashamed that he can't move past it. Adam's a bulwark, but he can't be everything for Parker. Plus, the calls of Salvation Island prove to be a siren song he has trouble resisting. I think if Adam had the ability to sail that far, he'd have forced Parker's hand much sooner. 
 Despite the harrowing plot, there is still a strong romance here. Parker and Adam are two men in love, and they take great pleasure exploring their relationship in ways that were soopa-hawt. Serious. I had to stop and fan myself at times. As the book drew near it's end, I was glad to watch Parker and Adam make it to safety, even as the seeds for a third book were clearly sown. Safety shouldn't be the only goal, in Adam's mind, not when there are so many humans struggling. I foresee a werewolf invasion, one that liberates humans and hopefully helps eradicate the virus--but that's my own hope! Also, the author has mentioned a fourth, related, book, and I expect it will involve one of Parker's rescues--Jacob--who will *fingers crossed* find a safe haven and partner down the road. 
 For paranormal/post-apocalyptic stories, this one's really on the contemporary-realistic side of those genres. There's little shifting, and the zombie menace is easy to imagine. I liked the elements of sailing included here, and thought it reflected a wealth of carefully-collected and sparingly delivered knowledge of actual sailing. I never felt overwhelmed by it; and I grasped how dangerous it was--in a way I had never really expected. In short, it felt so real, I could nearly taste the salty ocean spray on my face. I'm so in on this series, I might need to take drastic measures to get book 3 as soon as possible.

 I wanted to love the story. I liked the writing a LOT, really, but I was almost concussed with all the tragedy that befell Andie in the nine months following that positive pregnancy test. I think the only bad thing that didn't happen was a miscarriage. The whole book is a push to get Andie to give up her unborn child for adoption, and it seemed she'd only do this if her only other option was living on the streets with her unexpected bundle. 
 Lookit, I've a lot of experience with unwed mothers. Andie seemed especially naive, and surrounded by people who were inexplicably willing to sacrifice everything to assist her. That's all well and good, but the plot was really too convoluted for me. Was the message: Adoption is a great option? It didn't seem like it, the way Andie dithered over the decision. More like: Adoption is the absolute last resort which is a disservice. I've known people who gained children and gave children for adoption. It often works fantastically. As the author identifies herself as an adopted child, I was surprised at how grimly, and cavalierly, her character considered the prospect. 
 And, there was a romance. It was kinda saccharine. I've known guys who do what Neil did: offer to be a father to another man's baby. That he was willing to up-end his whole life for a destitute girl he fell for a decade before was over-the-top sentimental. The other plot twists and plummeting drops didn't work for me, but they may for other readers. On the whole I felt it went from melodrama to melodrama, and bordered on absurd levels of tragedy.

Nope. He has no family connections, one solid friend, and one close acquaintance. He teaches English language classes and GED-prep classes at a community center, in addition to some other administrative tasks. The random pain and general fatigue of MS, in Emerson's experience, has soured much of everything for him. Even sex, because he'd love to be the dominant lover he admires from porn. But, he's wasting away and barely able to keep himself upright, most days. So how can he manhandle a lover into submission, huh? 
 It's not super trendy to be the bitter cripple, but sometimes I can't help it. I hate this. I hate that I can't trust my body. I hate that there's no cure. I hate that some people with MS seem totally fine, like you can't tell their body is betraying them, and I'm this skinny prick who can't even get sucked off in a bathroom without falling apart. 
 I didn't bang my head into the wall. Self-pity is so much prettier when you don't have blood running down your face. 
 Emerson meets Obie on his bus to work. The attraction is instant, and infuriating. Obie's a hipster and still over-friendly. He wants Emerson, and that only gets stronger when he recognizes Emerson's got a kinky streak. I must say, Obie is a treasure. His positivity rattles Emerson, sets him emotionally off-balance time and again. Where Emerson would like to curl up in a ball, Obie's determined to pull him out of himself. That was so endearing. And, I loved Emerson's response to Obie--most of the time. 
 Then he was kissing me, and yeah, give me fucking more of that. I bit lightly on his lower lip and he grabbed my waist. 
 Not so much, son. I shifted my weight and turned both of us, leading with my right leg, until I could press him against the door. 
 He groaned. And, god, he had a sexy groan. 
 I get having a chronic illness. I get being depressed about it. Emerson wallows, and I got that, too. I dug how Obie turned his world around, made Emerson realize that, yeah, MS sucks, but it doesn't have to define you. They have some pretty intense sexytimes, where Emerson turns Obie inside out, in ways he hadn't quite envisioned, but still were thoroughly satisfying. Obie's a real creative sort--and I don't exclusively mean in the bedroom. His attention and his compassion give Emerson the license to confide, to depend upon another person in ways he hasn't done since being a young child. See, Emerson is wound so tight, he's trapped in a shroud of self-sufficiency, and I absolutely related to his inability to ask for help. Having a steady partner, like Obie, opens Emerson so that he reaches out for more help when its needed--and he even offers help to others, notably Obie's pseudo-sister, the very pregnant, not-so-happy, Mildred. Mildred is an emotional mirror of Emerson, and they bond over their collective misery. 
 The book moved in ways I enjoyed, especially as I hadn't predicted them. I pretty much lost my heart to Obie, much the same as Emerson did, and I was so glad that they had an HEA. It also looks as if Emerson has found himself more than a boyfriend, he's constructed a new family that accepts him as he is, even if he isn't rainbows and sunshine and never will be.

He's a web designer and doesn't go out much but one Boxing Day he meets Rupert, a fireman who's also a bouncer at a club near his home. Rupert's concerned about Jodi's state--he's a bit high--and walks him home. They share coffee and conversation. Rupert awkwardly confesses that he's gay--newly out and never been with a man--and they share a kiss. It's electric. But, it's also too soon for more. Rupert wants to call Jodi, waits a few weeks, and they meet again. It's all so new and frightening, but Jodi makes it seem so cool, that Rupert falls hard. So does Jodi. They move in within months and Jodi's just as smitten with Rupert's young daughter as he is with his sexy fireman. 
 Nearly five years pass in this idyllic domestic bliss. Then one day, Jodi's hit by a vehicle while crossing the street, and he's in a coma. When he wakes, months later, he doesn't recognize Rupert. Worse yet, Jodi doesn't remember any of their time together, and wants his ex-girlfriend, Sophie, back. He thinks. 
 This one was a true emotional roller coaster. I've read a few injury/amnesia books and they are always so compelling. The medical advice is often to ""wait and see"" what memories the patient will recover on his or her own--without too much prompting. It's a frightening experience to be unable to recall what one did yesterday, a week ago, but to lose years of memories, relationships, experiences is often debilitating. When Jodi wakes up and doesn't know Rupert, he freaks out--dead scared of the stranger in his hospital room. The physicians agree that Rupert should be patient, be a steady support, but not tell him all about their history. Rupert's shattered, yet he agrees to assume a position as Jodi's ""flatmate"" because he can't bear to walk away from the man he loves. Also, he's afraid telling Jodi will cause Jodi to reject him outright, and he'd rather be his friend than have no contact. 
 So, this is a hurt/comfort story in the extreme. I liked the flashbacks which allowed me to watch Rupert and Jodi fall in love the first time. There is so much tenderness! Most of the book takes place after the accident, and Jodi's recovery is a mess, not just mentally. He's got physical problems, and terrible headaches, and is mostly unable to care for himself for months. Rupert's job as a fireman takes him away for long hours, and Jodi's ex, Sophie spends lots of time as his carer. Jodi can't understand why they didn't work out, and he's confused by his unwanted attraction to Rupert. Rupert's daughter, who's looked at Jodi as a step-father for years now, is being kept away--because Rupert can't explain why Jodi doesn't know her. That said, meeting her in an unexpected way brings Jodi back to his earlier self. He starts to recognize that Rupert isn't his friend--that they had shared a life together, and he mourns his missing memories all the more. 
 I felt that the medical issues Jodi faced were all so realistic. Many of the symptoms and effects could hold for brain injury sufferers or those with dementia, to some degree. That helplessness and fury were so potent, while Jodi himself felt impotent. Little by little life realigns, however, and Jodi isn't willing to accept a half-life any longer. Memories may be gone forever, but new ones can be made, and he wants these to be bigger and better than those he'd lost--and also, with Rupert by his side. So, expect a lot of hurt, a lot of comfort, some sweet lovin' and some sassy quips on the way to an HEA.

 3.5 stars. 
 Cam and Theo are a married couple. They've been together 17 years--since college--and just over four years ago met Nate, singer in an up-and-coming band. They were up for some fun, and it worked so well, that Nate joined them, permanently. 
 Well...the book opens with Nate ecstatic for one of his rendezvous nights on the road with his sexy boyfriends, only to find Cam waiting for him. Because Theo is moving out of their house back in LA. Nate's blindsided and hurt, and Cam's a mess. They make love, but it's bittersweet. 
 Rinse and repeat that a few times. Sometimes Theo comes, sometimes Cam comes, see--while they can't live together, neither wants to lose Nate. It's a bad situation. 
 What Nate learns, as he strives to get his men back together is that Theo's been suffering depression for a long time. And, Cam's been struggling with borderline-OCD and panic attacks for a long time, and neither noticed the other's problems because they were too wrapped in their own mental illness. 
 There is a lot of bitter in this book. There are also points of extreme sweetness. As a person who's suffered depression, I felt it was more bitter than sweet. As a person who's weathered rough patches in a long marriage, it was raw to experience echoes of similar distance in the characters on the page. 
 It ends with a very reasonable and relatable and realistic reunion. That was really satisfying, but I still had a LOT of angst--some on the page, some of my own baggage--to heft before I got to the good parts. Those good parts coming at the very end of the book. 
 Poly romances are often hard to relate to, but it's not hard to relate to the unraveling of love. Nate was such a dear, really stoking the fires to get Cam and Theo to reconcile, but his efforts were in the wrong place, because only the people breaking up can do the making up--as Theo and Cam realized. 
 The mental illness issues were carefully described, and felt very real--especially the depression as I have first-hand experience with that. I liked how the solution was never complacent, not: ""we'll get over it."" Once Cam and Theo claimed their issues, they got productive help managing their emotional state. Part of their delay seeking counseling was fear that any marriage counselors would tell them they needed to cut Nate loose. I could relate with that fear, as poly relationships are not given the same weight as marriage, and that prejudice proved a hindrance to their health. Still, there were several lights at the end of the tunnel, and the end proved to be both happy and sexy. 
 In all, it worked for me. I just wished it had been a little more upbeat. I received a review copy via NetGalley.",Fri Jul 01 14:15:30 -0700 2016,Fri Jul 01 15:36:44 -0700 2016,Fri Jul 01 15:36:44 -0700 2016,,0,0

 Two loner 15 y/o Mexican-American boys meet at the swimming pool and become best friends...an more. 
 Ari, aka Angel Aristotle Mendoza--big, angry, mostly silent. Not afraid to brawl. 
 Dante Quintana--I think I'll let Ari describe him: 
 Who was this guy? He looked a little fragile--but he wasn't. He was disciplined and tough and knowledgeable, and he didn't pretend to be stupid or ordinary. He was neither of those things. 
 He was funny and focused and fierce. I mean the guy could be fierce. And there wasn't anything mean about him. I didn't understand how you could live in a mean world and not have any of that meanness rub off on you. How could a guy live without some meanness? 
 Dante became one more mystery in a universe full of mysteries. 
 See, Ari tells this story, and it's a sweet and quiet story of two boys who seem very different needing one another. Ari has a lot of questions and secrets, and he's nearly incapable of sharing his thoughts. Dante is had a ""face like an open book"" and that was both good and bad. 
 Ari struggles with his emotions because of his home life. His folks are nice, good, honest people, but he was a late child in the family. His elder sisters are married with kids and his elder brother is someone they never discuss--Bernardo is in prison and has been nearly all of Ari's life. There are no pictures of him, and Ari doesn't understand what happened. He also doesn't understand why his father, a Vietnam vet, is still so silent so long after returning from war. Silence is something Ari and his father share--as well as nightmares. 
 The Quintanas are an openly loving family. Dante still kisses his parents hello and goodbye, and they seem to like Dante very much, too. It's inexplicable to Ari to be so well liked. He's always been so closed off and he feels like Dante can see all his inner thoughts. Their friendship is something both wondrous and scary to Ari, who has never had such a close companion. Dante is the only person, ever, to whom Ari has confessed his worries about Bernardo. It's upsetting when Ari learns that Dante and his family are moving to Chicago for the school year. At least they have several weeks to spend together... 
 Well, until disaster strikes. It's a very unsettling experience, and results in a long recovery, mostly for Ari. Ari has a lot of frustration regarding his inability to fend for himself, and the forced company of people--Dante included--because Ari can't be left alone. It was interesting how Ari and his father drew closer in this time, not by speaking but by reading the novels that Dante brought Ari to pass the time. 
 I'm not going to discuss the whole story. It's truly sweet and special. Dante is fierce. He doesn't believe in holding back, even when he knows it's likely to hurt him. He loves Ari, and tells him so. He confesses his attraction for boys, and wishes that Ari would consider loving him. It's just so...starry-eyed and amazing and fearless, and fraught. Ari doesn't want this love. He loves Dante as his best friend and can't bear to lose that singular connection. 
 There are some experimentations that are unsatisfactory for both Ari and Dante, but it's the growth that Ari does within his own self, with the help and communication between his parents that gives Ari the ability, the permission, to explore deeper within. It's a coming-of-age story, but it's also a coming-to-awareness story. Ari struggles to discover the mysteries of the universe, and understands that he is a universe of mystery to his own self. He can't figure out who he is, what he wants, or what he needs. Part of this is tied to his family's secrets and silent pain. Ari's heart is so big and fragile, he keeps all his feelings locked down to avoid being hurt anymore. His nightmares reflect this pain, and confusion, and I liked how that was another way he connected with his father. 
 There are no steamy parts here. Bits and pieces of underage drinking and a little drug use. There's a tiny bit of foul language--and I had to laugh reading how Ari tries to clean up his potty-mouth near his disapproving mother. The families in this book are really treasures. I love diverse fiction, and I loved how these two Mexican-American families are so positively portrayed. They are kind and hard-working and thoughtful and loving. Bernardo is a dark mark, but his problems stem from his own psychosis, and not that of external (gang) influences, which I also applaud. I dislike when problems are written from the least resistance pathway. It was also really insightful, to me, how Dante and Ari felt about their own heritage. Ari is sometimes nervous that he's not as Mexican as some of his neighbors and family; Dante feels very much cut off from his Mexican heritage, and it's an issue for him. Both boys are outsiders, in truth, and that caused realistic and understandable friction. Being a bit too removed from that immigrant experience, I really enjoyed those moments of cultural enlightenment. 
 It's a really interesting read that breezed right along in beautiful prose. I hoped and hoped for the best of all happy endings, and I was rewarded for my patience. That a sequel is in process gives me great joy.",Fri Jul 01 10:26:45 -0700 2016,Fri Jul 01 11:25:50 -0700 2016,Fri Jul 01 11:25:50 -0700 2016,,0,0

THIRDS is set in an alternate world where a disease resulted in an altered human state--Therians are a new race of shifters that exist side-by-side with Humans, and there's often trouble. Police officers of THIRDS are matched Humans and Therians partnerships, and they are sent out to settle civil, criminal and domestic disputes (think SWAT, but for shifters) that involves shifters. 
 Dex and Sloane have been partners in THIRDS and partners in love for over a year. They have survived many a tragedy, together, and are now openly living together. Sloane recently ""marked"" Dex, scratching him with his jaguar claw. This is a very dangerous bargain, because marking results in an open link between their emotions. Dex can feel Sloane at all times, and comes to crave being in Sloane's presence. Also, the scent of Sloane on Dex is a cause for problems, as other Therians see Dex as a mark to be claimed--a prize to be won. It results in quite a lot of conflict, fending off these would-be mates. 
 Dex, Sloane and the rest of their THIRDS team have been steadily, covertly, training in TIN--Therian Intelligence Network--physical tactics, and it greatly benefits Dex when he's kidnapped and needs to escape what is clearly certain death. His torture by a Therian Spook called Wolf sets Dex on a path of discovery about his parents. John and Gina, who were murdered when Dev was only 5, may have been covert operatives, but for whom? Unreliable sources say they helped incorporate Sloane, Ash and other First-Gen Therians into the youth experimentation project that was little more than torture for years on end. It's more than Slaone can take, thinking that Dex's mother was somehow involved in his horrible youth--and that's a big wedge to their otherwise healthy relationship. 
 It's also clear that Dex isn't exactly unchanged after his rescue. The Therians around him are experiencing some odd, and downright baffling, responses to his presence. When Ash buys Dex gummi bears we KNOW there's something BIG happening--and I liked how both the mystery of Dex's parents and Dex's subtle transformation were two intertwined plot-lines. This adds a whole new layer to the THIRDS saga, and still keeps the other relationships intact. 
 Speaking of relationships, there are two that are brought front-and-center in this book. A reunion and a revelation, and I think readers will be happy with both. Also, sexytimes for Dex and Sloane have never been more molten. Good gravy! And, there's still that winsome humor to lighten up the dark moments. Lots of seriously good counseling from supporting cast--never thought I'd be saying this, but thank goodness for Ash! I experienced a small trip down memory lane going through Dex's treasured childhood belongings, as I was a Care Bear Kid back in the 80s, too. This one's going to bring out the feels in so many unexpected ways; even as I cursed Sloane, I still wanted to love him up. And then smack some sense into him. And then love him up again. 
 Don't judge me! I wanted to love Dex up, too!! 
 The end isn't a cliffhanger, but it certainly leaves a wide range of possibility for new stories, adventures, and mayhem. Me, and my Cheesy Doodles, can't wait.",Fri Jul 01 06:08:56 -0700 2016,Fri Jul 01 07:33:37 -0700 2016,Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,1,0

His two children are at college and he works long hours in solitude. His daughter wants him to remarry. His minister wants him to remarry. Women from his church want his to remarry--and David refuses. He'd rather be alone than yoked into another marriage he doesn't want. 
 Christie is a svelte out-gay man living and loving in Manhattan. He's thirty and jaded, unhappy with the same old party scene, but this all changes when his roommate and bestie, Kyle, nearly dies of an overdose. They vow to live life to the fullest, and while Kyle marries a man who'd long chased him, Christie decides to take six months to clear out the house his aunt left to him. There isn't much to do in Pennsylvania Amish Country, and Christie's excess energy soon finds an outlet in gourmet cooking. Kinda a pain cooking for one, though, and his silver fox of a neighbor is single. He strikes a bargain--they split the cost of groceries, and David can stop existing on TV dinners. 
 Soon, David and Christie are spending more than dinner together. They converse, they jog, they work David's farm, a bit, together. Christie is falling deep into like, and David's thrilled to be the center of someone's attention for the first time in his life. He loves how Christie seeks out recipes from far off lands, places David has always longed to visit--but never could--and studied via National Geographic. Their camaraderie is not unnoticed, and David's theology-student son, in particular, is deeply troubled. 
 David had never suspected Christie was gay, and Christie never mentioned it--mostly because he was afraid to lose David's friendship. It's a big kerfuffle when David learns, but it's not the end. Nope, it's a new beginning. 
 I really loved the quiet and slow-burning romance here. It's really tender, and lovely. Christie isn't vamping for a man, he's building a friendship with a man he never intends to have relations with, only to learn that David's not averse. David has walked paths laid out by others his whole life, and he finds himself very unhappy. Should he continue to suffer in silence to appease people--his elderly mother and children--who are barely part of his life? It's not a hard choice to make, on the surface, but can David trust that beautiful, talented Christie truly wants a middle-aged farmer hick, like himself? Outing himself would separate him from his entire Mennonite community, and could easily spell financial ruin, but in the end, David's just not willing to live a life without love, and die early and unhappily like his father. 
 There are some really harrowing moments, and emergency services are necessary more than once. I was nearly beside myself with concern, and was glad that those scenarios turned out positively. I thought the small cast of supporting characters was all rendered very solidly on the page. I think I might have liked a bit more background on the Mennonite experience. David's nearly estranged from his faith at the time we meet him, so it's not so hard for him to pull farther away. I honestly didn't learn much about Mennonites, and that was a shame, for me. 
 That said, I love the story, and I adored both David and Christie. That they found love together was kismet.",Thu Jun 30 15:39:54 -0700 2016,Fri Jul 01 01:05:03 -0700 2016,Thu Jun 30 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,3,0

 Tom Paretsky is a plumber with a skill that allows him to find ""lost"" things. Unfortunately, he often finds dead bodies, it seems. He's newly engaged to Phil Morrison, a private investigator. Tom's called in as a favor to his sister Cherry, to find something lost, a valuable diamond necklace, for uppity Amelia Fenchurch-Majors. This puts him on the cross side of Amelia's step-daughter, Violet Majors. 
 And, when he discovers a body in the midst of the church picnic fundraiser it's a big, big problem. 
 Okay, so this is a mystery and it has lots of peril--some bits more mild than others--but it's also a character study. Tom is fantastic. His language is sublime. I never, for an instant, was confused about his Britishness. 
 ""So, I've had everyone and his bloody dog asking me all kinds of crap ever since, up to and including Will it rain tomorrow? and Can you just fill in this lottery form for me? ta very much."" 
 ""That's just silly. You can't do anything like that."" She paused. ""Can you?"" 
 ""Sis, I live in a two-bed semi in Fleetville. What do you think? But try telling them that. Everyone seems to think psychic means whatever they bloody well want it to mean. 
 Tom and Phil are a sweet couple, still trying to figure out what to do with their relationship. When will they marry? Where? Will they move to Tom's house, Phil's flat or elsewhere? Tom has yet to meet Phil's family--and that's a fun Sunday roast dinner scene. 
 Seriously, I was so entertained by Tom I almost didn't care at all about the murder mystery. Though, the investigation continues and it's complicated and sordid and there's plenty of dead-ends and fits and starts. Tom has such a fun and fresh outlook. His dry humor just sings to my soul. I love his bestie, Gary, who makes it perfectly clear that he and his hubs wouldn't mind a bit of four-way with Tom and Phil. Those sassy blokes! This regular-guy-with-a-gift mystery is just good reading. Expect a harrowing moment or two; the killer sure doesn't want a psychic getting the better of him (or her!) and might take the opportunity to snuff Tom's candle. Little bit of sexytimes, but it's not a big part of this story at all. That said, I liked that their relationship progressed nicely, and in a way that very likely leads us into further mystery stories down the pike.

 5+ stars... 
 First off, I want to say that readers will likely want to begin this book on a weekend, or when they have some serious time to read. Because it is long. And, while I never felt it slow, there is no getting around the length. 
 Secondly: wow. Or, Wow. Quite possibly WOW. 
 I've read a metric ton of shifter books. Hetero, gay, lesbian, menage, YA. For real, this is a genre that I know. 
 Wolfsong stands apart. 
 Ox is a strapping boy, if a bit slow. He's teased for his lack of intellect, but he's a steadfast and loving boy who takes care of his mom, working in the place of his derelict father from the age of 14. He becomes a mechanic in their small town of Green Creek, building lasting friendships with his fellow grease monkeys, especially Gordo, the owner of the garage. 
 Ox and his mom share a small cottage in the woods, which shares a lane with a stately home that's been abandoned nearly Ox's whole life. 
 On his 16th birthday, Ox meets Joe Bennett, who he believes to be a precocious kid, but 10-year-old Joe hadn't spoken in over a year before they meet. The Bennetts have moved into the abandoned house and he wants Ox to meet his family, so he drags Ox to their house. It all seems very sweet, especially when Joe gifts Ox with a small stone wolf on the next day--a belated birthday gift. 
 The Bennetts are absolutely gone for Ox, in a way that's strange to him. He has close relationships with his mom and Gordo, but Joe's parents and uncle and elder brothers really interact with him strongly. When bullies at school attempt to taunt Ox, the Bennett boys stand up for him. They invite Ox over for dinners all the time, and Joe is soon Ox's best friend. Joe's father counsels Ox continually until Ox begins to think of him as his true father--and the feeling is mutual. 
 The years pass and over time Ox recognizes the oddities of the Bennett pack. Because they are indeed werewolves. His strong connection to Joe binds Ox to the pack in a way none had really predicted, and it's Ox that Joe needs to maintain his grasp on humanity. Little did Ox realize that Joe's gift so many years ago would bind them forever. Ox is a man who gives his whole heart, like Joe, even if Ox doesn't see Joe as a partner for much of the book. He is so much younger, and fragile in many ways when they meet. The story unfolds over a period of nearly fifteen years of Ox's life. And the revelations that he finds in himself and his pack are far more than Ox could have ever expected. 
 Even without a love spark, Ox has a protectiveness for Joe that is unwavering. He learns of Joe's previous kidnap and torture by a rogue wolf, and is filled with rage for Joe's suffering. That his abuser lives is a serious problem, especially when he escapes his magic-fortified prison. Ox and Joe share a love that was so present for so long that the second Ox realizes the sexual feelings he has for an almost-grown Joe, he's humiliated for being so blind. There are moments of such sweetness and humor, and they help with the parts that are so dire. 
 I honestly don't want to linger too long on the plot, because it is epically winding. An underdog becomes a hero. The unlovable finds love. Strength is a measure of power, and force, but also of patience and love. Bad guys will take and take until they cannot take any longer. It is the righteous who will win the day. Any of these could summarize themes in the book. Rest assured that all the threads are part of a rich and beautiful tapestry that is resolved at the end. It's mostly a love story between Ox and Joe, but also between Ox and Ox, and that may sound stupid, but Ox has no love for himself. That the future Alpha of all the North American werewolf packs, Joe, loves him is unimaginable, unfathomable. He's a simple man, and his world is turned inside out by his connection to Joe and the Bennett pack. There is first love and heartbreak and battles to the death and mourning and separation and deep longing and resentment and daring moments and heroic measures. 
 The writing itself is non-standard, with prose that is lyrical in many ways and was a little challenging at first. The entire book is told by Ox's viewpoint and the spare sentence structure often belies the deep context. Repetition of certain images and memories are a big part of the story, and how Ox sees his world--not just in abstract emotions, but in vibrant color and brutal clarity. The characterization is epic, and that includes the accessory characters, as well. I could completely see several spin-off books from this one alone, because I would read whatever the author had to offer on at least five other characters from the Bennett pack. I want to assure readers that, despite the pack wars and the double crosses and the separation and the resentment, the book ends on a happy note. There are a couple of scenes of steamy goodness, but it's a small slice of the giant pie.",Wed Jun 29 10:48:50 -0700 2016,Wed Jun 29 11:33:14 -0700 2016,Wed Jun 29 11:33:14 -0700 2016,,2,0

 Two Boys Kissing is an interesting and engaging read following the lives of roughly nine characters over a weekend. The focal point of the book is a Guinness World Record breaking kiss--32 hours and change long. It happens between two former boyfriends, to raise awareness of homophobia, specifically a hate-crime beating of a classmate. In the tapestry of the story we encounter two boys who meet at a gay prom, and experience the newness of first attraction/love. We experience the sedate affection of an out couple, who still struggle to define their identities. And, we follow a loner boy whose world implodes when his parents discover he is gay. 
 The narrator is a haunting Greek chorus of the dead. Gay men who were beaten, murdered, slayed by their own hand, or ripped away by the chilled fingers of AIDS. The insight, the care, the lightness of this chorus of men I wished I'd known brings me, as a reader, personal melancholy. 
 Such waste. Such misfortune. Such tragedy. 
 Still: 
 We do not want to haunt you too somberly. We don't want our legacy to be gravitas. You wouldn't want to live your life like that, either. Your mistake would be to find our commonality in our dying. The living part mattered more. 
 We taught you how to dance. 
 No, the chorus is there to hover and inform, not imbue with guilt. 
 There are few things that can make us quite as happy as a gay prom. 
 Ignorance is not bliss. Bliss is knowing the full meaning of what you have been given. 
 There is a power in saying, I am not wrong. Society is wrong. Because there is no reason that men and women should have separate bathrooms. There is no reason that we should ever be ashamed of our bodies or ashamed of our love. We are told to cover ourselves up, hide ourselves away, so that other people can have control over us, can make us follow their rules. It is a bastardization of the concept of morality, this rule of shame. 
 I seriously had chills in reading this book. At the heart of it, Craig and Harry are two boys who are willing to make a public stand. Their classmate Tariq was assaulted by a group of gay-bashers while waiting for his father to pick him up from the movies. He was alone, and wondered how they knew. Through careful omniscient vignettes we learn that Craig is closeted, on the verge of coming out, while Harry is out. Harry's parents are supportive, and when Craig is overwhelmed with sadness following Tariq's beating and their budding friendship, he enlists Harry's help taking a stand--doing something the fallen couldn't even contemplate in their time: planning a public kiss to beat all others. 
 Meanwhile, nearby, Neil and his boyfriend Peter have many a date night. Peter's parents are cool with him being out. Neil's parents silently accept, but do not openly approve of their son. They experience the moments of Craig and Harry's kiss via the live webcast, but also in person when they are compelled to be there, witness a moment in history that is specifically relevant to them. 
 Meanwhile, nearby, the GSAs of neighboring high schools have organized a gay prom in a community center, and blue-haired Ryan meets pink-haired Avery. Can Ryan accept that Avery was born different? Those moments of sheer magic, finding a kindred spirit, and potential partner. Potential joy and potential pain are in high concentration. 
 Meanwhile, nearby, Cooper's father sneaks into his room to discover the explicit chatting he's been doing on gay websites. The rage is astounding, and sets depressed and despondent Cooper on a reckless search for something, something more than the nothing of his life and how he feels about himself. 
 The story is fiction based on an historic record-setting kiss between two college boys. The characters in this story are all teen boys in high school. Parallels to their experiences are being drawn throughout, and when tragedy seems to be about to strike, there is still hope. The kiss is not without problems. Both Craig and Harry must stand the entire time, lips touching. There is no time for toilet breaks, to take a sip of water, to eat. No one can hold them up, or prop them in any way. Haters come to call and attempt assault, despite the presence of law enforcement. The kiss is live-streamed, news broadcast and subject to grave disapproval--of the parental kind. Distractions abound, and at any moment either Craig or Harry could succumb to the fatigue that is tearing at them, but they strive to achieve what neither could have done alone: be a beacon of hope, be an agent of change on an international level.

 Fitch is out at a gay club in Manhattan celebrating his beloved (lesbian) sister's 21st birthday when he's struck by the beautiful lead dancer in a risque set. Fighting an attraction to an androgynous male dancer was not part of his designated driver duties...but his sis buys him a lap dance with Ansel, and that's a worldview-shaking event for Fitch. Big burly and macho, Fitch's never even fantasized about being with a man before; nearing thirty he's been disappointed in love-a bunch. Still, he can't get Ansel out of his brain. 
 Ansel Becke was a homeless teen, brutally abused by his German mother for his cross-dressing activity as a child. Unable to tolerate the abuse he ran away, turning tricks to stay alive on the streets. In the past five years he's had some better turns, meeting four other out-gay runaways at a shelter and building the Sassy Boyz together has given him and income and a purpose. Still, the past never quite goes away; Ansel self-medicates with booze and drugs. Meeting Fitch is too good to be true. How could a decent man, a straight man, have a serious interest in a former hooker and current hedonist, amiright? It's not like Ansel even screws the same man twice... Still, Ansel is intrigued by Fitch's interest and sincerity. For a short time he even cuts out the booze--just so he can fully enjoy all of his delicious experiences with his enchanting construction foreman. 
 It seems like everything is going great for Ansel, really, he even reunites with his younger brother who seeks him out while on a trip to NYC, but it's really too good to be true--in Ansel's head. The past never really leaves us, does it? And for Ansel, his history is especially painful. I really loved how Fitch sought the truth of Ansel's backslide. And, how he wouldn't let Ansel's self-loathing destroy what they had built. I was also really stoked that Fitch came clean about his new lover--even if that lover was a man--to his conservative friends and family. He acknowledged his bisexuality without being on the hook, at all, in many ways. The reaction of his confidantes was mixed, but not horrible. My god. When Fitch took Ansel to ""meet the 'rents"" I just completely fell into everlasting love with Fitch. He's the Best Boyfriend Ever. #Certified 
 This book sets the scene for four more books, I expect, one for each of the dancers in Sassy Boyz. The femme vibe is strong with these young men, and it's an interesting dynamic. I liked how they all had an interest in women's fashion and they seemed to be very well-recieved within their gay community. There was some bashing, particularly when Ansel sought out straight men while in his female attire and make-up. There are several plot threads open for conflicts in future books, but this one ends with an HEA. Expect Ansel and Fitch to make it happen and make it werk. Or twerk. Probably both. Looking forward to the next book in this series!!!

He's had two serious relationships in his life, one in college and one that ended six years ago, when he kicked out his longtime lover, Donny. Donny was a fellow officer when they both served on the police force, but Donny was a self-destructive alcoholic and Jeremy needed to save himself, after a while. Jeremy is a widely respected ranger, known for rescuing many of the homeless in the parks he patrols. 
 Donny turns up on Jeremy's doorstep one night, bleeding from superficial stab wounds. While Jeremy won't let himself get pulled into Donny's drama, he does help him out. His discussion of the crazy night to his good friend, Rhoda, is overheard by Qayin Hill, a patron in Rhoda's coffeehouse. 
 Qayin (Hebrew for Cain) is a drifter, ex-junkie who's been clean seven years and is trying-at 45 years of age-to rebuild his life. He wasn't always that way. Once he was an abused kid who sought refuge in a suicide attempt-and hails from Jeremy's home town. In fact, they knew each other way back when. Qayin's ashamed of his past, but he's attracted to Jeremy, who really grew up from the short, pudgy boy that was teased mercilessly in school. Qayin hides his true identity from Jeremy, but only for a short while. 
 This proves a small setback in the courtship. Bigger issues press, like when the guys who messed up Donny decide to toss Jeremy's apartment, and bodies begin to turn up. While Jeremy isn't a cop any longer, this does have elements of a police romance. Bad guys on the distant edges are a constant threat, but the real danger is the emotional investment of Jeremy and Qay. They have a lot of scars that they wouldn't generally share, but they do, creating an intimacy that is more valuable than sex-which they decide to postpone for several dates-despite a significant attraction. 
 I really liked how these guys made themselves vulnerable. Qay has so much shame over his past, and still owns it. He's a depressive, who's had more than one suicide attempt, and admits his recovering addictions (to prescription and illegal drugs) on their first meeting; Jeremy is only ever supportive. Jeremy has a bit of a hero complex, and he knows it can be overwhelming. His life really has been in the service of others, which is why it's so crappy that Donny brought huge problems to his doorstep. No matter what, Qay won't add more burdens to Jeremy's back. Even if it means walking away from the only man he ever loved, and who loved him in return. 
 The book spans several tumultuous weeks, which seems a little fast for a true love to develop, but these guys have a history of attraction. Once Jeremy gets over his initial shock, he remembers that Kevin (Qayin's birth name) was his first crush. For all the guilt and terror that Qay still carries of his childhood, he recognizes that young Jeremy Cox was a bright spot. Their intense attraction and deep confessions lead to a strong emotional bond. Plus, these guys are in their mid-forties. They have learned a lot of the world, and are open-minded about past mistakes. 
 Trouble comes, as it is wont to do, and Qay is as rock-solid as he can manage to be. Especially as Jeremy is in very bad shape. That said, it is the growth of their relationship that most distresses Qay. He's never had a stable relationship, and he feels unworthy to Jeremy's goodness. I think I knew where, specifically, this book would take Jeremy, Qay, and me, but I wasn't a bit put off by the journey. There are some ghosts that can only be laid to rest by confrontation. It was a fairly spectacular reunion, and a sweet epilogue. I'm quite sure that readers will disagree with the title. While romantic love may not conquer all, in this story it was pretty close. In the end self-love, for Qay, won the day. 
 There are some great secondary characters here, most notably Rhoda, Patron Saint of Caffeinated Beverages, but also Nevin Ng, another close friend of Jeremy's who has the mouth of a drunken trucker, despite being an awesome cop. Trigger warning, there are lots of discussions of depression, suicide and abuse. Also, a brief scene of graphic violence and torture.",Wed Jun 22 11:38:28 -0700 2016,Wed Jun 22 11:39:22 -0700 2016,Wed Jun 22 11:39:22 -0700 2016,,0,0

It's an adult romance, set in a 1870s England Steampunk world, rife with political intrigue, assassins, vampires, werewolves, and mechanicals. 
 Preshea Buss is a four-time widow, mostly by choice. Trained as an assassin in her Finishing School she accepted the favor of a known vampire, Lord Akeldama, who proceeded to get her ingratiated to men who needed dispatch. Well, not the last one. He was just old, and not very troublesome. Dubbed the ""Mourning Star"" by the tabloids, she's never met a man who'd claim her heart. She's been contracted to destroy the budding romance of a plain, but well-fortuned woman, Lady Violet, and her erstwhile, penniless suitor, Mr. Jackson, by Lady Violet's father, the Duke of Snodgrove. It's not really Preshea's cup of Darjeeling, but the reward will enable her to ruin the one man who decimated her heart: her dastardly father. Plus, there are concerns the Duke is in grave danger of assassination. Preshea can protect the Duke while she manages Mr. Jackson... 
 Captain Gavin Ruthven is a recent retiree from Her Majesty's service. The tall, broad Scotsman would normally never be interested in a wee lass like the Mourning Star, but they are thrown together for three weeks while he attends his longtime friend, Jack (Mr. Jackson) on his quest for Lady Violet's hand. It's a good cover for the captain's other mission: ensure the Duke isn't killed. Is the noted widow there for pleasure, or will she seal the duke's death? 
 I was drawn to this author because of her quirky and fun YA steampunk books. While we are still in that world per se, this novella is fully adult, with zinging banter, scandalous repartee, and steamy interludes. It's not a kids book, by any means, and I really enjoyed this slow-burning romance. Preshea has never been touched with love. Abused as a child, and a married woman, she has no need for another man in her life. She's well-settled due to her many inheritances, and Captain Ruthven--while attractive--initially appears the epitome of a lumbering brute. Yet, the more time they spend the more she is captivated and intrigued by his quiet nature and compassionate conversation. Gavin has little interest in the staid ladies of the ton, even if he were a catch. He's done well financially, making a decent fortune in investments, but he needs a woman who would take him well-in-hand. In short, he's a submissive, and he lives to pleasure women with his compliance, as well as his body. 
 Expect mischief and mayhem, and the employment of dirigibles to both assassination and seduction. As with previous books, the story is rollicking with a pace that sweeps the reader into falling for unlikely heroes. Gavin is perfectly edible, and Preshea is a lonely woman who never understood all that she'd missed growing up so isolated. Not only does she gain a lover, she makes dear friends. Poor Mr. Jackson, is, however, broken-hearted....for a time.",Wed Jun 22 06:26:49 -0700 2016,Wed Jun 22 07:37:17 -0700 2016,Sat Jun 18 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,1,0

 All the Wrong Places is part of the Bluewater Bay series, but as with all the books in the series, it is written as a standalone. Also, this is a romance between two asexual characters, so do not expect sex. 
 Brennan Cross is a 25-year-old semi-pro skateboarder who has just caught his girlfriend of the past 18 months having sex with his friend in their bed. This is the third girlfriend he's lost to cheating and he's feeling a bit battered. Brennan wonders why is he so lousy in bed, because it has been made clear by all three women that his sex drive is far below that of his partners. 
 Frustrated, Brennan heads into Red Hot Bluewater, the only sex shop in town, to see if there are some materials he can read to help improve his sex drive and prevent a fourth romantic disaster. Instead, he meets Zafir. Zafir is a Lebanese man who's been raised in the US, and is a semi-lapsed Muslim. He's also a single parent, raising his 9-year old son--conceived when Zafir was sixteen. 
 Zafir is asexual, and recognizes the similarities between what Brennan confides and things he has discovered about his own self. Zafir describes asexuality and Brennan isn't convinced, at all, that this fits him, but the more Brennan considers asexuality and studies it, he thinks it could apply to him. 
 In the meantime, Brennan strikes up a friendship with Zafir, at first to discuss asexuality--which is confusing to him--and later because they make good companions. After all, having a person to talk to, and share troubles with, and watch a movie together, that was the best part of his previous relationships. It's Zafir's son, Tariq, who finally asks: Are you and Brennan dating? 
 I liked this story, because it really gets to the heart of asexuality: the desire for an intimate companion with, or without, sexual activity. Brennan was a great best friend to his girlfriends, who all found him consummately respectful--on account of his lack of pressure regarding sex. He was happy to follow their lead and allow them to initiate, which clearly didn't work. He's also been strictly heterosexual, so finding Zafir to be attractive as a companion was a hard step to take. Essentially, Brennan had to decide if he could be intimate--asexually--with a man. The thing is, he was so comfortable with Zafir before they ever took that step that it was practically the very next step to take. 
 There are so many sweet moments in this book, and many center around Tariq, who is a smart and generous, but shy, boy, who also wants to learn to skateboard. Brennan is eager to assist, as he'd pretty much skate everywhere if it were possible. Those moments of parental terror Zafir experiences were easy for me to identify with, and all the reactions seemed so very authentic. I also respected the care that Zafir took to shield Tariq, to some degree, from fallout from his relationships. Zafir has dated both men and women in the past--he's biromantic--and Tariq accepts Brennan as a potential partner for his father without even a raised eyebrow. Also, the Muslim aspect was handled very well, which is something I've come to expect from this author, who continues to write stories that are not simply sexuality-diverse, but also ethnically and racially diverse. Brava. 
 While there are no hot-and-heavy scenes, there is plenty of affection, and a quiet romance. In a genre that's growing to be fully LGBTQ-spectrum friendly, I really thought this book hit a good balance for asexual characters. Others I have read paired Aces with people who pretty much wanted regular sex, and those seemed a bit doomed. Zafir's been engaged (to a woman) before, and it seemed she left for a similar reason, but this new relationship with Brennan seems custom-built to last. The writing is expressive and the pace is excellent. I never wondered where the story was going, or how long it would take to get there. It was easy to bond with these characters, and I hoped they'd get through their rough patch with little delay.

 3.75 stars. 
 This is the second book in a series, but it follows a new couple and I enjoyed it without having read the first book. 
 Roman ""Quick"" Webb is a bounty hunter in Atlanta. He's an eighth-degree black belt, having honed his skills in martial arts (which type was not specified) since his teen years. The youngest, weakest son in his family, Rome was bullied and picked on mercilessly, but his training helped him control his violent anger issues. His best friend, Duke, owns the bail bonds company for which he works, and Duke is currently dating/living with Rome's son, Vaughn. Their new coupledom has left Rome at loose ends, not wanting to be a third wheel, or see his bestie macking with his son. Rome has acknowledged his bisexuality, but never explored it, despite being divorced from Vaughn's mother from what seems to be* 23 years. 
 (* I had real problems with basic math, and history in the book. Deets below.) 
 Dr. Cayson Chauncey is a lonely renal surgeon. He was present in the first book as the doctor who saved Duke's life by transplanting Vaughn's compatible kidney. He had an instant attraction to Rome, and was heartily rebuffed, as Rome couldn't handle Cayson's obvious flirting. Now, however, Rome would relish it...and Cayson won't be made a fool of again. Nope. He's had a lousy run of men who never wanted to be out with him, and his most recent friend-with-benefits, Dr. Joe Wellington, is so deep in the closet he barely touches Cayson, yet still expects him to come when beckoned. Cayson's done being a lap dog, and nearly snaps Rome in half when Rome tries to put some weak-sauce moves on him. Rome's used to wooing women, and he has no idea how to talk to a brilliant doctor. Vaughn totally schools his dad, which was a fun idea. 
 So, I really liked the wooing. There were sexytimes galore, because Rome made his interest in Cayson perfectly clear and perfectly open. He wants to take his pretty doctor out on the town, and Cayson is ecstatic. He's never had a ""real date"" in all his 42 years, and wants to be wooed. Wants to be truly wanted. So, he swoons under Rome's unflinching desire. I also loved how committed Rome was to the project of learning about his sexuality. There has never been a character's computer browsing history I more wanted to explore, I think, as Rome learned all about doing the down-and-dirty via YouTube. He was unashamed, unabashed, and completely enthusiastic to love every inch of Cayson. That was totally hot. 
 Enter the jealous, unhinged ex subplot that seemed completely outside the realm of reality, at first. Dr. Joe wasn't even an adequate lover to Cayson, and still wouldn't walk away. Even knowing that he'd never be a good partner because he didn't want to come out, Joe kept stalking Cayson. His bribery offer to Rome? I couldn't understand it. Even allowing for an egomaniac, I struggled to find sense. In the end there are some real serious problems that result in one death, one beating, a huge rift with the bail bonds personnel and Dr. Joe pleading for his life. I think I kinda believed Joe's spiel that things got outta hand, because I couldn't understand how such a timid, well-educated man with SO MUCH to lose would actually concoct the plan that was undertaken. Also, timeframe. So much of this book happens within a WEEK. Not enough time to really build the bond that is, like, practically impenetrable from the story. 
 Okay, math and history are not the strong suit here. The ages of people in this book really got to me. Rome knocked up his high school sweetheart as a senior in high school and married her out of duty. So, he was 18-19 when he became a father. Vaughn is 30. That makes Rome nigh onto 50, if I consult my first grade son. The book opens with Rome telling me he and Duke are lifelong friends in their early 40s. Hmmm. *scratches head* Also, Duke is ten years older than Vaughn, according to Rome. *eyeballs that* *rejects it* It would mean that Rome became best friends with Duke when he was 16 and Duke was 6 or 7, which I do not buy, at all. Also, Rome ""learned how to cook watching YouTube,"" when he had custody of Vaughn as a young child. Folks, YouTube did not exist 20 years ago! The Internet was in its infancy, then. You could get recipes online, maybe, but no flashy YouTube cooking shows. So, yeah, these kinds of things--bad math, bad history--pull me right out of a story. They cause me to stutter in my head, and pause and wonder about logic and sense, and that's the kiss of death for ME as a reader. Also, I struggled with other mechanical editing issues like misspellings, wrong words, made-up words, and the like. It probably won't bother most readers, but these issues just poked at my already bleeding logic wounds. 
 I think if you like really toppy alpha-type men, who assume total control without having a lick of experience (and yes, Rome even excelled at rimming first time out of the gate...) and men who are totally passionate about being great lovers, and being loved openly, than this book is perfect for you. I struggled with the logic, and I STILL enjoyed the story, because it did hit a lot of high notes for me, even if I had a dozen, or more, mental eye rolls while reading. There are at least two more books planned for this series, if I can infer anything from the set-ups between the King brothers and Dana the sniper. I think I'd like to dip into this world again, and see if the writing gets stronger, because the storytelling is good already and mechanics get better the more an author writes, in my experience.",Thu Jun 09 08:28:34 -0700 2016,Thu Jun 09 08:30:21 -0700 2016,Thu Jun 09 08:30:21 -0700 2016,,0,0

He had no idea when he was recruited, as a child, by a blood magician that he was doing anything illegal. It was only when his mentor and caretaker was found guilty of murder that Crispin's involvement became known. He's been offered several mentors to re-train him in acceptable use of magic--and has failed all attempts, his magic--graphimancy--simply doesn't work like other types. Using his forbidden bone pen (fashioned from one of his own finger bones!) Crispin can draw with his own blood and make magic happen. It's a bit harrowing, and highly frowned upon. 
 4.5 Stars 
 Ned and Crispin met when Ned assisted in the capture of Crispin's murderous mentor. They have maintained a clandestine love over the past several months, despite Ned's aversion to magic. He is ""flit"" able to hear magic, and he also despises this ability. As Crispin takes on yet another mentor, Ned's getting embroiled in a magical plot--jar sellers, like his neighbor, are being killed in extraordinary ways. Ned can hear the use of magic, and Crispin breaks his oath to save Ned and his rag shop for certain destruction.

Like, corrupting one pure soul is worth more than a dozen athletes dying to Go Pro...for example. Abaddon really dislikes soul harvesting. He avoids it, at all cost, but he's gotten a warning due to his lack of productivity and is due to be demoted if he doesn't get one soul in the next month. 
 So, Abaddon searches high-and-low for a sterling soul, one that will push his quota far back. He locates one such soul, a shining beacon of a man, in Seth. Seth is the blind virtuoso who plays for a tent revival group which travels the southeastern US. He's also more than just a man--as Abaddon soon learns. 
 Seth is 21, innocent, sweet and complete catnip for Abaddon. His soul-hunger is off the charts whenever he's near Seth. Seth was an orphan, dropped at the doorstep of the revival, and adopted by the late revival master. He gets along with his surrogate family, and truly believes in the word of The Lord, but he wants a true love, and he's both a virgin and gay. It's interesting and cool that the revivalists are totally unaffected by that. The more time Abaddon spends in Seth's presence, the more he begins to realize that Seth is mystical in a way that's nearly unheard of. I don't want to give too much away, but expect trials with snakes and faith healing that works. 
 In the meantime, Abaddon is plotting his harvest of Seth's soul, and he's also really wrecked over it. How can he condemn such a good man to an eternity in Hell? There are surely things Abaddon can trade Seth to make his human life more bearable, but will Seth accept them, knowing these gifts come from a Devil's hand? As atonement, Abaddon plans to pull every string he can to ensure that he and Seth will be able to connect in Hell, and spend their eternity together. It's still cold comfort for Abaddon... 
 It's a quick read and an interesting story. I do love me a conflicted devil, and Abaddon is really a fun character to enjoy. The scenes in Hell are amusing and made me chuckle many a time. The unfolding romance was tender and touching, and I swooned for Seth just as hard as Abaddon did. I hadn't quite predicted the full path of this book, which charmed me, as a reader. I loved the positive portrayal of the revivalists, and the stalwart and battle-ready chaperone that Seth and Abaddon had to avoid whenever they wanted some alone-time. There's a heady build up of sexual tension, and a sweet love that's on the page.",Wed Jun 08 07:33:18 -0700 2016,Wed Jun 08 07:34:20 -0700 2016,Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,3,0

 The Only Option is part of the Dubious novella collection, all of which include a marriage of convenience. It's a high fantasy story that includes magi, necromancers, dragons, and magic. 
 Rochus is a necromancer, one highly regarded for his talents by his Queen. As part of his training and practice, Rochus only has half his soul, and his body reflects this lack in that he's deathly pale, has blue hair, nails, and teeth--which are very sharp, and he only drinks blood for sustenance. He's not a vampire, though they also exist in this world. No, Rochus is a wealthy man, and orders his blood brought to him in a pitcher or cup. 
 Rochus is en route to the palace, under the Queen's summons, and stays the night at a familiar inn. Being approached by Tilo, a sexy young dragon, is not his preference, at all. Rochus has been the victim of violence before and won't let a sexy creature, like Tilo, lure him away from safety no matter Tilo's sex appeal. Well, the best laid plans don't lead to the best laid necromancer. Tilo has his wicked way, and Rochus is rather pleased about it...until he arrives at the castle and learns that the Queen is ordering him into marriage--to Tilo. 
 It seems that Tilo has some very serious issues brewing in his lands, magical elements that can only be handled by a necromancer. His repeated petitions to the Queen for aid were never received and went unanswered, until Tilo had to resort to such a dramatic request. Rochus is outraged and feels as if he's being made a fool of. While he submits to the wedding, he's quick to alert Tilo that his professional services as a necromancer do not fall under a husband's prerogative. 
 Well, that pretty much guts Tilo, and his genuine remorse for all his desperate machinations is what turns the tide for Rochus--and maybe fosters some love, too. 
 I really dug all the magical elements in this story. None of it felt easy, or convenient. There are moments of true peril that must be overcome by careful consideration and application of Rochus' extensive magical skills--and sometimes some plain out dragon fire, all of which felt totally germane to this world. I loved Rochus' many pets and how in synch they were as magical helpers. Rochus and Tilo were both well-drawn characters with heaps of integrity. Rochus is a proud man, who's been hurt many many times before. He's older--43 years--and has a lot of trouble believing that any man as young, attractive, and virile as Tilo could ever truly want him. This insecurity is what causes him to drive Tilo off, again and again, and I felt that it was really well-considered. It's obviously not simple age that's a problem; Rochus' physical oddities and profession as a necromancer are not generally attractive, as Rochus' history has taught him, so he's wary of building a rapport that will only end in heartbreak. And, yet, Tilo demonstrates again and again that he's really in it for Rochus, not just his magic. It gave Rochus just an inkling of hope for more, which was fantastic. I also loved the dichotomy of the hot dragon and the cold necromancer and how they were so complementary to each other. 
 The only issue I had was that of time. It seemed as if it only took a couple days journey to reach Tilo's fortress--and that seemed a mite unrealistic, considering the other spans that were discussed in the book. Other than that, this is a really awesome piece of fantasy that has yummy sexytimes and two very compelling main characters. It may have begun with a marriage of convenience, but it ends with a courtship and an expectation for an HEA.",Tue Jun 07 07:24:43 -0700 2016,Tue Jun 07 07:38:11 -0700 2016,Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,0,0

 This is the third book in a series but can be read as a standalone. 
 Michelin Moses is a rocker-turned-country singer. He's in his late 30s and hardly ever been kissed. Yes, for realz. He's a closeted gay man, who is also demi-sexual. That one falls under the Ace spectrum. In short, he's generally only able to be sexually active with people with whom he shares an emotional connection. 
 While attending a birthday party for one of his proteges, Michelin finds himself seeking connection to one of the go-go dancers, Lucky, who is actually quite polite to him. Their interaction soon balloons into a gigantic mess that outs Michelin. Part of the damage control involves getting Lucky to pose as Michelin's boyfriend--and that's super awkward because Lucky is out-and-proud, loud on the YouTube, while Michelin is a veritable hermit. 
 The aftermath is not pretty. Michelin is attacked by the country music machine for being less than wholesome, and he fears his new record will be canned, panned and banned. It's a heartbreaking experience for him. In the meantime, Lucky is a steady support. He makes it very clear that he will accept nothing from Michelin--he's been burned by rich men in the past--and he puts up the most believable front of ""true love"" as could be conjured by the PR spin doctors. 
 I really liked Lucky because he was kind and compassionate, for the most part. He saw how difficult all of this was and kept his own emotions in check. Lucky's world was tipped sideways too, and whatever notoriety he may have gained from publicly dating Michelin won't actually pay the rent, or get him into the Vegas reviews he longs to dance in. Michelin soon forms the connection he needs with Lucky, it's impossible given their close quarters, but just when he's actually ready to embrace Lucky as his second gay (or any) lover, he gets more bad news from his record label. 
 Expect some really emotionally frustrating experiences for Michelin. He's a man all about his music, and having his professional life ripped apart because of his personal life is essentially soul crushing. He doesn't want to be the Gay Country Singer, he just wants to be A Country Singer, but he soon realizes that he really has no control over his perception by others. I could respect his feelings on being a standard bearer; not everyone is capable of shouldering those expectations. I could also relate to his private self and public persona, and how those two people were very different. It was good that Lucky wasn't an opportunistic jerk, and I really loved how he grounded Michelin, in many ways, but most of all affectionate touch. What a balm to Michelin's soul to have Lucky at his side. 
 The end is a giant grand gesture sort that definitely had the tears filling my eyes. The sexy sexplorations that Lucky guides Michelin through were my fave combo of sweet and hot.

That I continued to go back says a lot about what I thought of the story. I didn't realize, until the end notes, that this is a re-telling of the Dickens's classic A TALE OF TWO CITIES, not that it mattered at all to me. I've not read that book and it may have helped me get through this one faster, but I doubt it. 
 Lucie lives in a divided city--New York City, in some futurescape where magic reigns and those who practice Light magic live in beautiful, wondrous Manhattan, while those who practice Dark magic are relegated to the Dark city. My relations in Brooklyn would not be impressed that their property would house the most despised denizens of this magical realm. Lucie was born in the Dark city to parents of Light magic. It's a rarity, and she escaped by the help of her aunt. Lucie helped her father escape magical persecution, and became known as the Golden Thread in the Dark, for all her efforts to bring attention to the suffering there. She, or rather her persona, is a rallying point for the growing revolution in the Dark city. 
 Lucie is dating Ethan Stryker, nephew of the most powerful man in Light city. They have a physical relationship, but Lucie hides all her Dark secrets from Ethan. For him, and all, she is the perfect young woman. Agreeable, pleasant, undemanding, barely noticeable; she lives in constant dread of Ethan's uncle rescinding her ability to stay in Light city, and condemning her and her father to Dark exile. Ethan seems captivated by Lucie, in love with her, but she doesn't trust this, due to her own issues of trust. Ethan also has a dark secret, one we learn in the very beginning; he has a doppelganger, Carwyn, the product of Dark magic performed when he was a baby to save Ethan's life. Dopplegangers are forbidden magic, and the Stykers hid Carwyn in the Dark city hoping he'd die before he was discovered. Not so. 
 Ethan's life is nearly forfeit when Carwyn steps in. Lucie doesn't know how to handle it, but she also knows she can't abide Carwyn being abused, as he's been all his life, for being a doppleganger. Her magic is strong enough to alter Carwyn so he isn't immediately pegged as a doppleganger...and that's the beginning of the end, in many ways. 
 I wasn't terribly impressed with the story, mostly because bloody rebellions are not my thing. Expect the revolution to come, and expect Lucie to get swept in despite her best attempts to do nothing, not be seen, and keep her family safe. The last item is pretty much the only redeeming quality Lucie possesses: deep family loyalty. She lies at every turn, hides her use of illegal magic, sends Ethan into a situation he can't possibly escape, and sets Carwyn free to wreak havoc as he sees fit. #MoveAlong #NothingToSeeHere *magic fingers* 
 There's a *bit* of a love triangle, but not really, for me. I didn't sense a strong attachment in either direction for Lucie, for much of the book, and Carwyn played things way too close to the vest for me to see anything but teasing. When his big reveal came I suppose I had a better understanding of him, but it only magnified the melancholy. I often wondered at the direction the story was taking, sure that I'd missed some key piece of information that would help it make better sense, but I didn't. I suspected Lucie's aunt to be exactly who she was, and had no real understanding their manners to each other after their tumultuous reunion. Lucie hides so much of herself I got lost in her head, and that wasn't good because she's impetuous and secretive at the same time. 
 I imagine the end follows closely to that of the Dickens tale, but it was an absolute downer for me, as a reader. Just when I thought the day might be won, well, nope. So, don't expect a happy ending. I also had more terror over the possibility that this book might continue into a sequel, than regarding the peril in which the characters were mired. For those who abhor a cliffhanger ending, I'm happy to report: it's a self-contained story.

 The book is set in England, and is delightful in its Britishness. 
 David Piper wants to be a girl. He's 14 and tracking how his alien body grows and sprouts and becomes something he cannot tolerate. Everyone thinks he's gay--but he thinks of himself as a girl trapped in a male body, and spends hours lounging in cast-off girl clothes when his family is out and he is alone. He is a social misfit, having only two friends--and wants so desperately to tell his parents how he truly feels--that he is transgender--but is afraid to disappoint them. David attend Eden Park school, housed in a rather affluent neighborhood and still containing all the rude elements of teen society--David's bullied mercilessly by a group of classmates. 
 Leo Denton lives in Cloverdale, a very poor neighborhood. I believe the term ""Council Estates"" is one that would be applied--which is the British equivalent of ""welfare housing"" in the States. It's a mess of a place and he and his two sisters live with their mother, a gal very much in the market for a decent man. Leo's father split before he was even born, and Leo idolizes the idea of having a father. That isn't so hard when his homelife is dismal. Leo was a star pupil at the Cloverdale school, he's brilliant at Maths, but an ""incident"" has caused him to transfer to Eden Park. 
 David wants to reach out to Leo, senses his deep loneliness, but Leo brushes off most attempts at friendship, including David's. Leo wants to keep his head down and not cause a stir--even though the whole of Eden Park's students think Leo must have been a troublemaker--maybe even violent--to allow his transfer. One day, when David is being tormented by the bullies, Leo snaps--his temper really has been a problem in the past. Their mutual punishment--detention--puts them in close proximity. Leo feels bad for David, sees something in him that he recognizes in himself, and he offers to help David in math--as subject David is failing. 
 They develop a tentative friendship, and this is problematic for Leo. As is his attraction and budding friendship (maybe more) with Alicia a self-styled singer/songwriter and one of the classes most popular girls. 
 This is such a fantastic and affirming story. There's a bit of a love interest brewing between Alicia and Leo which leads to consequences only Leo could have seen coming. David is Leo's staunchest friend and supporter, and when things go bad at school it is David who tries to fix them. David has his own challenges, and being friends with Leo, and learning from Leo's struggles, allows him to build the skills and strength necessary to come out to his parents, and begin the path towards transitioning therapies. I don't want to say that things got easier for David after those revelations, but many of his fears were assuaged and his contentment regarding becoming his true self: ""Kate"" was so spectacularly joyous. 
 This is a teen book, but it's really clean. Also, it's touching and tender and poignant and captivating. I found myself so rooting for both David and Leo to find their own ""normal"" which required them to be honest, build friendships and allies, and those activities surely assisted them in reaching their goals. It was a fantastic read for teens, particularly those who may also be questioning their gender identity. I say this because it was a candidly told story that felt relatable and with sufficient depth of both character and plot to be a realistic emotional resource. I really enjoyed!

 Jaxon has spent his whole life being labeled the ""stupid"" kid, and never really learned to read due to severe dyslexia. He CAN read, some, but it's a real struggle and requires intense focus--he dropped out of high school due to his disability. He's cultivated his memory, to compensate, memorizing entire maps of the city so he can navigate fares as a cab driver. One Tuesday evening he picks up a fare outside a swank bar. Caleb is a very attractive man in a power suit, and he's a bit drunk. He offers no conversation with Jaxon, simply showing him a card that bears his address--and the logo Jaxon instantly recognizes. Caleb communicates via non-verbal cues, and this works fine. Jaxon's mostly grateful his drunk passenger doesn't puke in the cab--and the big tip doesn't hurt, either! 
 The next Tuesday this repeats. And the following one, as well. Both men find the other attractive, and Caleb decides to make a little move--he writes a note to Jaxon on the charge card slip. He really likes the way his cabbie successfully interprets his non-speech, and wants to cultivate something...more. I think both guys are a little sad when Caleb's schedule changes and there are no more bar pick-ups, but they reunite one Friday when Caleb is completely smashed and is nearly swept off his feet by a slick bar pick-up. Jaxon insists on taking Caleb to his residence and that really strikes a chord for Caleb, once he remembers the bulk of what went down the next morning. 
 I loved how these guys worked together to communicate. It's such a refreshing story to have guys from different backgrounds--education, occupation, and financially they are polar opposites--find such common ground. Jaxon is a total dear, trying to learn some ASL (American Sign Language) so they can better communicate in person on a date, and Caleb absolutely respects his efforts. He won't let Jaxon put himself down--and highlights the many ways that Jaxon is smart--despite his dyslexia. 
 It's a very affirming story, and a fast read. The pace is excellent, and the emotional connection is tender and lovely. My biggest complaints are: I want more! And, I'd have loved there to be any steam at all in the book. Aside from a few on-page kisses these guys take all their love to the bedroom and close the door. :( *shrugs*

As an orphan that suffered through many a lacking foster home, Henry craves a partner that will be completely gone over him. His ideal mate is a straight man that he ""converts"" because this man will have (in Henry's mind) no previous experience with male lovers and also be completely smitten, because...reasons. Did I mention Henry's a little neurotic? Oh yeah, and a terrible flyer after a REALLY bad experience a few years back. 
 He owns his own plane, even if he only flies a few times annually. This allows him to completely lose his shit and not risk the public humiliation of being bumped off a commercial flight. Unfortunately, Henry's flight to LA is grounded when his highly-vetted pilot experiences chest pains. The replacement pilot, Evan Roth, is stunning, young, and apparently straight. Henry has acquired his newest target... 
 Thing is, Evan's not exactly straight. He's pretty much the right guy for Henry, though. Henry's chase is hampered by Evan's refusal to repeat the mistakes of his youth, falling for a man who'll surely let him down. That said, Evan gets on board with the sexytimes plan without TOO much delay. 
 That's when things go sideways. Henry and Evan share a connection, one that builds over the course of a couple of months. Still, Henry's childish attachment to being The Only Man Ever for his perfect mate is patently ridiculous and causes undue heartache. It's good that he has peeps who are willing to call him out for his prejudice, and that Evan's willing to forgive his mistakes. I really liked Evan bunches. Henry wasn't my fave love interest, but I found space to forgive his nonsense, much the same as Evan did. 
 There's some fun sexytimes, including a busted menage that blows the smoke out of Evan's eyes. If only Henry could have been that forthright all the time.",Thu May 19 16:59:27 -0700 2016,Fri May 27 02:41:59 -0700 2016,Sun May 15 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,0,0

 This series revolves around a secret colony of canine shifters--collies, German shepherds, bulldogs, the gamut--who either became ""quickened"" (able to turn human) after bonding with a special human, or were born ""quick"" to quickened parents. This colony exists in Mad Creek, California, a tiny mountain town which is fiercely guarded by Sheriff Lance Beaufort, a collie shifter. 
 Jason Kunik is a quickened Malamute geneticist working for a pharma company in Vegas when he got a bad vibe from one of his superiors and learned his personal research (sequencing his own DNA to find clues about quickening) was under direct scrutiny. He fled to Mad Creek, the only home he'd really known, even if he hadn't been back since high school graduation. Anxious to do something worthy of his knowledge and skill, Jason begins interviewing newly quickened humans, to learn if there is a specific pattern to gaining the Spark...and it goes disastrously. Jason isn't a people-person, and he's not a dog person, either. He scares away any of his subjects by being brash and obtuse. *sigh* (Not all scientists act this way!!) 
 Milo was a shelter rescue adopted by the staff at a Fresno hospice, and he's miserable. All the humans he bonds with are dying. Lily Beaufort discovers him while visiting a friend, and dog-naps him back to Mad Creek. Milo's so skittish and in serious emotional pain, only wanting a real home where he's actually wanted. Jason takes pity on him and brings him back to his big cabin, for a few reasons--he finds Milo attractive, he feels a kinship to him as they are both rather misfits, and Jason expects that he'll be able to study Milo's growth into humanity at close range if they live together. 
 They have an unexpected tenderness to their developing friendship. As a care dog, Milo can sense the pain and suffering in others, and even illnesses! He'd been around so many dying people, he developed in a very different way from the ""regular"" quickened, and that makes him so unique and precious as a subject--but Jason soon finds that he's getting swept away by Milo's tender nature and compassion. 
 This book has a major outside threat: illness. A former Mad Creek resident returns--in his dog form--and he's too sick to shift back to human. Quickened first responders are now becoming ill, and that includes major characters...the backbone of Mad Creek, in essence. Jason, Milo, Tim and Matt (from previous books) are put on the trail to an Arizona shelter where Patient Zero likely had contact with normal, but sick, dogs. I liked how this played out, with Milo and Jason coming to terms with each other, and balancing each other's strengths. Milo seems to love Jason, and Jason's totally afraid to lose his heart to Milo, even if he already has. I really wish we had a little more time in Milo's brain, so we could see how his compassion was only one facet of his affection and growing love for Jason. 
 I'm not a virologist, but I appreciated the actual discussion of the disease, and Jason's attempts to get control of it. He's not a virologist, but as a scientist he has learned the most important lesson out there: admit what you don't know. He seeks help, as surreptitiously as possible, so he won't reveal the colony, but in a way that will gain him the knowledge and expertise necessary to solve the crisis. 
 This book will certainly lead to another, as there is a bit of a cliffhanger regarding Jason and his expertise, but the love story is sweetly completed with Jason and Milo becoming a stronger pair than the two were separately. I really would have liked a little bit more loving in this book--it was nearly 75% before we got ANY real sexytimes, and that was almost too long for me. That said, Milo is the sweetest Labradoodle on the planet, and I'm glad that Jason remembered no human--or canis sapiens--is an island unto oneself. 
 Also of note, I'm keeping a constant observation of my gentle Lab-Pit mix to see if she's got any hint of a Spark happening. *sadly none as yet*",Tue May 10 08:43:58 -0700 2016,Fri May 13 11:19:56 -0700 2016,Sun May 08 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,4,0

The book opens with Fisher's house being invaded and the message that his secret lover, Zach, has been kidnapped. Fisher must now come clean to his team about his sexuality (funnily enough none of these guys had any misconceptions of Fisher's sexuality...) and his lover. 
 The attempt to recover Zach turns Fisher inside out and upside down. Mostly because Zach's on the wrong side of the gun. Yup. Is Zach, as he later claims, a deep cover operative investigating international human trafficker organization--Pentasus? Or is Zach just a bad dude. 
 The rest of the book is Fisher and Zach coming to terms with their secret lives. They had been living together, secretly, for months, and Fisher had thought he'd found a man to spend his life with--until Zach's Big Secrets are revealed. The time frame of the book is really compressed--the whole span is roughly 48 hours, so we have an hour-by-hour unfolding of their relationship--from fury and betrayal, to reconnection and resolve. 
 Zach must get back to his role, and Fisher thinks it's a suicide mission. It likely is--except Fisher won't stand for it. 
 Expect hate sex, make up sex, making love and lot and lots of explosions. For me, I wanted a bit more of Fisher and Zach, on the page. It was tough coming in at such an adversarial moment, and it took a while for me, as a reader, to catch up.

 Lila Sterling is an orphaned teen in a magical world. She's got plenty of magic herself, including the ability to sense magical power and transfer power used against her into magic she can use for herself. These are rare Talents, and she could find herself fighting for her life if power-hungry demagogues, like Victor Draconi, could get his lethal hands upon her. See, Victor has already killed Lila's father and mother, and he's the brutal leader of one of the four Families (think magic mafia) that control the power and commerce in Cloudburst Fall, NC. 
 Lila is employed by the Sinclair family as a bodyguard to Devon Sinclair, a beefy Bruiser, only son to Claudia Sinclair, head of the Family. Lila's mother had worked for the Sinclairs many years ago, and Lila feels safe in their world--except she'd discovered a cache of magic infused weapons that had been collected by Victor. These mark the capstone in Victor's plan to kill the other Families and seize all power in Cloudburst Falls, so Lila, Devon and Felix steal the majority of the weapons--with the help of Deah, Victor's daughter (and Lila's cousin)--and replace them with fakes. 
 It's not long before all-out war is declared. It's a bloody business and many lives are lost. It sould have been a massacre if Victor's minions had the magic-infused weapons, however. Lila has the ability to end the siege, and bargain for the release of captives, using the very blades she stole from Victor. Oh, and win also a magic duel to end all battles. 
 I love the tension in this book. So many life-or-death moments, and increasing suspense. It's a tough road for Lila, who wants to kill Victor, but needs to use her head, and plan the perfect revenge. When the time comes, she's still a girl, one fighting for her life--and those all whom she loves. She and Devon are a couple in the book series, and they have appropriate levels of affection, which are wholly clean. Expect Lila to be hurt, downtrodden, and nearly out of the game altogether, but to persevere against all expectations. The magical elements of this world are truly charming, with unique fauna that have deadly abilities. Who knew I'd love me some Lochness monster? Yes, even a tentacled beast of the deep had me going Aww!

 Roman was a K-9 explosive sniffing dog deployed to Afghanistan and thoroughly bonded with his handler, Sgt James Pattson. They served together for two years until their convoy was attacked and Pattson killed in action. Roman was shipped back to his home kennel, and his mourning for James triggered the Spark, and Roman ""quickened"" from his German Shepard body into that of a human male. He escaped and hid until he found another quickened who directed him to sheltered and remote Mad Creek, California, home of a colony of quickened dog shifters. He's been learning how to act human for the past two years, but things aren't generally easy for him, still. 
 Roman is nervous about this new assignment for the Sheriff's office. He's a deputy there, under the tutelage of Sheriff Beaufort (Lance from How to Howl at the Moon) but now he's being tasked with watching over DEA Agent Matt Barclay. Matt has been stationed in Mad Creek as part of a network of agents keeping tabs on illegal pot farming in the California mountains. 
 Matt is a closeted gay man, afraid to come out and gain the disapproval of his retired colonel father. He lives with a childhood friend, Luci, in order to shield himself from questions about his sexuality, but it's causing more harm--as their pushy parents are expecting an engagement. Matt's frustrated by his growing attraction to Roman, and also by Sheriff Beaufort's constant attempts to thwart Matt's integration into Mad Creek life. It's comical how Matt is shuttled around and openly feared by the residents there, and only manages to raise his awareness of every bizarre incident he witnesses in ""Mad"" Creek... 
 Naturally, baddies do arrive, and we have a front row seat to their dastardly deeds--including murder. Roman is injured in the line of duty and adopted during his recuperation by an unknowing Matt. It's so sweet how tenderly they treat each other, and their love definitely grows quickly and strongly during their weeks and months of surveillance. Because Roman spent his early years as a dog, he has no sense of human sexuality. He's attracted to Matt, but doesn't know how to express it, and had been steadfastly warned against ""dog"" behaviors--like cuddling, nuzzling and getting too close--that would clue Matt in on Roman's true feelings. I was both entertained and enthralled at Roman's ""puberty,"" and Matt's an eager partner when they finally get together. 
 Expect some heartbreak, however, because Matt's still unsure about coming out, and his father's a meddling meanie of a man. Also, Roman's not sure he can trust another human--he's lost both the men he ever bonded with, one of them permanently.

 Five years ago Elsie's twin Eddie was swept out to sea while they played at the beach for their 11th birthday. His body was never recovered, and her family has never recovered. 
 Eddie was a smaller child, and though chronologically 11 years old, he was far smaller than Elsie and not able to be educated in the school system due to developmental delays that may have stemmed from gestational issues or a birthing accident. He was several developmental years behind his twin, and Elsie defended him ruthlessly. They have an elder brother Dillon who witnessed some of the events on the beach that fateful day, but neither he nor Elsie, nor their parents, speak of it. Ever. 
 We start out the book on the eve of Elsie's 16th birthday, with the family preparing for their annual memorial visit to the seashore to pay respects to Eddie's cross. It's all very emotional, and bitter, what with Elsie feeling forlorn for the loss of her twin, and the loss of her own celebrations. What she rarely admits to anyone is that she ""hears"" Eddie within her, and she speaks to him often. She wants to know what happened on the day of his drowning, but no one will ever speak of it. 
 As Elsie makes her way through she suffers horrible bullying, depression, and the knowledge that what remains of her family is disintegrating. Dillon's got a girlfriend, but there's something very off about him lately; he's growing scarily thin. Her father spends as much time at work, or traveling for work, as possible, and her mother is a functional alcoholic. 
 During the course of the book we learn that Elsie loves spending time near the water, as it helps her feel close to Eddie. Eddie was a boy who loved the shore, and the dolphins, and Elsie creates a haven for herself at an abandoned boating club--which is now being refurbished by Mick, his son Danny and nephew Tay. They want to run scuba tours and freediving classes. Elsie has been continually warned against going into the water, but her rebellious side allows her to be goaded into it--and there she experiences flashbacks of that fateful day. 
 Driven to determine the full truth of the horrors of Eddie's final moments, she begins to train with bad-boy Tay, and eventually the mean and enigmatic Danny, so that she can make deep freedives into the inlet where Eddie drowned. 
 It's a really fascinating look at the way loss changes the dynamics of a family. There are so many converging problems: her father's anger and withdrawal, her mother's depression, her brother's eating disorder. Elsie, in pseudo middle child form, feels a deep need to piece everything together. The emotions run high, and it's a thrilling experience for Elsie to have the interest of a boy--for the first time ever. All her training for freediving alters her appearance, and gives her a different mindset--she aches to achieve a final communion with Eddie, and that was really poignant, if rather troubling. 
 I really related to Elsie's determination, and understood her seemingly flighty nature. No one has seemed to care about her in a very long time, so why should she bother? And yet, she finds the strength to do so. She's not a very admirable character, in many ways, but I felt that her faults were those of circumstance. She feels as if she's a pariah, and she's often treated that way. Tay is the one guy who sees her, not the Twin Who Lived, and that's a refreshing experience for a girl who mostly fades into the shadows. 
 In all, the book was interesting, and I found myself rapidly turning the pages as the drama became more and more intense.

 4.5 Stars. 
 Jon is a 25 y/o man who is in a good place in his life. A recovering anorexic, he has battled back from the brink, and built some true friendships, notably Gabe, from previous books, and Henry, an older man who took Jon in when his family cast him out and helped him through his recovery. Jon prefers his regular porn shoots for no-strings sex, as his last relationship (with emotionally-abusive Rick) was completely toxic. He's not looking for a partner, and is busy caring for Henry who has end-stage prostate cancer. When Henry learns he has a long-lost grandson, he wants to meet him, and spend whatever time he has making one last connection. Jon assists, and is struck by Isaac. 
 For his part, Isaac suffers PTSD from domestic violence-Henry's unknown son was an abuser-and witnessing his mother be attacked by criminals. Though he's 22, Isaac is agoraphobic in the extreme and hasn't left his home willingly since his grandmother died a year ago. He's also mostly deaf, due to his father's battery. 
 Isaac is initally terrified of Henry, whose resemblance to his abusive son is traumatic, but he braves out a single meeting a little mystified by the beautiful man who accompanies Henry, Jon. Not long after, Isaac rescues a lost kitten who strayed onto his porch, and he reaches out to Jon to bring supplies. They hit it off, and begin a casual friendship mostly via online messaging, at first. Jon wants Henry's dying wish to become true, so he continues to build a friendship with Isaac in the hope that Henry will be invited to spend more time. It doesn't hurt that Jon feels attracted adn protective of Isaac, wanting to make his sheltered life better, too. In the meantime, Jon's ex, Rick, returns and his ED is triggered. Jon and Isaac's friendship becomes more than friendly, with brief forays into the physical. It was all so new, and unwelcome, for Isaac at first, given his history with abuse and violence. Ultimately, Jon and Isaac are sweet for each other, and their cooperation turns into a tentative passion, and then a tender love. 
 I loved the time frame, here, with very reasonable baby steps forward for both Jon and Isaac over the course of months. Jon's job as a porn actor isn't seedy, and his views on it change as he develops strong feelings for Isaac. For those who may be concerned about fidelity issues, there are no cross-overs; Jon is highly respectful of himself and Isaac. I really liked the open and honest communication that was present throughout. Jon is so compassionate and this really turns Isaac's head in the best way. It was so fun, also, to have a front row seat to Isaac's awakening, emotionally and sexually. I was captivated by his self-sheltering, and also with his management of his hearing. It was really interesting how he chose to wear his hearing aid some times, and not others, based on whether he wanted to interact, or shut out, those around him. All of his many mechanisms to keep the world safely locked outside his door, but Jon was able to sneak inside-inch-by-inch-Bear, the playful kitten, was a huge part of that process. 
 A lot of the book is sweet and tender, though there are some bits that are tragic, what with Henry's progressive illness, and others that are downright creepy-scary. What are Rick's motives? And, is he behind the mysterious visits and packages Jon's receiving? Expect some harrowing moments while that gets sorted. I was glad that everything turned out so good, and look forward to more excellently-told stories of the Mean Green porn boys, now that we've gotten to know a few of them in this book.

Since then his mother became ill with cancer and John moved into her home to care for her in her last days--she died four months prior to the beginning of the story. John's a virtual recluse in his mother's empty home; he works as a substitute teacher, and has one friend, Maggie--his mother's longtime neighbor who's like a second mom. 
 While caring for Maggie after a hip replacement, he takes her to choir practice and is instantly struck by the larger than life choir director, Rhys. Rhys is so shiny he's like staring into the sun--and his passion for music jars John from his long doldrums. For many, music is a healing balm and John--a born and trained musician--has prevented himself from experiencing music for so long he's a desert awaiting the rain. John allows himself to join the choir for the night, and finds it's just this side of too much to bear. Maggie is pleased that John could find some solace in the music, and overjoyed that he decides to continue accompanying her to the practices. John, for his part, is experiencing an almost unwanted attraction for Rhys--a man too young and too direct and too much for John to handle in his vulnerable state. Learning that Rhys, too, mourns a lost lover, their union becomes a situation that is nearly unavoidable. 
 Rhys may only be 23, but he's lived his years. Well, not the last year and a half, perhaps, not since Lyle's tragic accident in any case. Rhys and Lyle were first lovers, and performing sensations, sure to secure that recording contract they both sought, and the dramatic end of their love and life together left Rhys broken inside. Finding John to be in much the same state, Rhys is drawn to him, a kindred spirit, despite the 19 year age gap. Rhys sees that singing helps John to emerge from his grief shroud, and gently encourages him to embrace the second love of his life: music performance. I can tell you, reading this book was not a breeze. It's bittersweet, and raw, and captivating all at once. I had so many emotions coursing through me, channeling the grief and loneliness and reluctance of both John and Rhys to move forward in life and love. Their guilt at finding happiness was so understandable, and so poignant. And, John has some real doubts about being so much older than Rhys. Even if they work at it and it works out...John expects he'll die first breaking Rhys' tender heart again. Can he do that? It seems unconscionable to him. 
 There's a powerful adage that goes something like this: Joy shared is joy doubled. Grief shared is grief halved. I think that Rhys and John experienced that in the story, and I know it's true in my life. I loved every second of the pain I felt while experiencing John and Rhys' story, and I loved it even more when I watched their love grow and develop and become a new and bright thing for them to share. As you can imagine, there are some ups-and-downs to the story, yet it ends on a note that is so happy, it's impossible to believe that the harmony between John and Rhys is anything short of perfection.

 5 Stars for this historical M/M romance set in 1820s London. 
 Lord Richard Vane is the go-to man of his collection of wealthy friends of a certain (homosexual) persuasion. And, his personal valet, David Cyprian, is Richard's go-to man, the one who will soil his hands with the sundry business of keeping ""proper"" gentlemen from social and legal peril. David is more than a valet, he is Richard's closest confidant and the man to whom he is attracted beyond bearing, and one man that Richard will never pursue because doing so is 1.) beneath his station 2.) too wrought with the power-imbalance. A man should never dally with his housestaff. Not a good man, anyway, and Richard is nothing if not the perfect gentleman. 
 David has lost his heart to Richard over his nearly five years of service. There is nothing David will not do for Richard, and he takes great pride in caring for all of his intimate details, attiring Richard in such a way as to make him the envy of all his peers, and David a sought-after valet. Not that David is willing to leave Richard's service, well, not until that fateful kiss, that danged incendiary moment that David cannot forget and that Richard refuses to address. 
 The ensuing quarrel puts Richard in a place he has been before, on the outs with the man he held dearest, for the simple problem of not knowing how to deal with his love's needs. Because, yes, Richard unequivocally loves David, and wants him back. He tries to arrange things so that he can keep David close, though not directly his servant, and this is unsuitable, as well. It seems all is lost, to Richard anyway, when his mates come calling. There is a predicament--likely stemming from the plots of previous books--that could cause the death of two of his friends' partners, and a great deal of embarrassment for not only Richard's friends, but also himself. There are few ways to handle this situation, and none of them suited to the gentry. No, a go-to man must be employed, and David is the best of them. If only Richard's obtuseness hadn't sent him packing. 
 This is a fascinating book. As I mentioned I had not read the earlier stories in the series, a deficiency I plan to rectify. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, with two men from such different worlds falling for one another, and how rigidly they kept their roles, when their deepest desires could have been quenched by some proper tumbling. (Or, improper tumbling, which I will reveal DOES happen and is delicious!!) The problems of the Ricardians (Richard's set of friends) are all very dire, and David takes the weight of them on his narrow but sturdy shoulders. The villain of this piece is a man that is generally detestable, power-mad and brutal, and his comeuppance is well-planned and brilliantly executed by a man who is not simply a servant, but a red-headed bastard to boot. It was a fantastic coup and one more reason Richard loves him with his whole gigantic heart. 
 The book ends with the assurance of love and partnership, inasmuch as it can be managed by a gentleman and his go-to man in such times. I adored it, and hope they pass many years in private togetherness.

 Will and Patrick met in Vegas and got very drunk and very married in one night. They would have separated, but Will convinced Patrick to stick it out until he could legally untangle them without losing millions of dollars in his Good Works trust--money that would have returned to Will's mafioso family's coffers in the event of a quickie divorce. They have been through the emotional wringer back in Will's hometown of Healing, South Dakota. Patrick, a newly unemployed neurosurgeon, has been hired by the hospital Will runs and as the days and weeks and month have passed both Will and Patrick have developed real loving feelings for the other--but neither of them is brave enough to admit it to the other--both believing their marriage has an expiration date and not wanting to ""humiliate"" themselves by loving a man who doesn't return the sentiment. 
 This installment is the last--and best!--and promises an HEA in the title, for goodness sake. That doesn't mean it's easy, however. Nope, this serial is all about the long game, and Will knows he loves Patrick, but he also is afraid that Patrick only loves him because of their forced proximity. When the possibility of a no-mess divorce is made real, Will wants to take it--and give himself and Patrick the space to find love on their own terms. One of those ""if you love him, set him free"" scenarios that absolutely flips Patrick's wig. 
 Patrick has barely known love in his life, and Will telling him he needs this break is a club to the head. He's heartbroken and miserable and absolutely resolved on gaining Will back, once their one-month hiatus is complete. That doesn't mean he's not angry. Because he is. He needs Will in his life, and not having him is the crap frosting on the cow-pattie-pie of things in Patrick's world. Expect a very caustic man having one after the next personal and professional disappointments. 
 Not going to belabor this. The break up is hard on both men, and the reunion is fast, furious, and a little filthy. It's a yummy ending with a pair that I almost feel at home with, after nearly 900 pages of their fictional misadventures. Such a fantastic ride. It took me a bit of time to warm to them, particularly prickly Patrick, but they are now my bosom pals and I'm so glad I stuck with the books!",Mon Apr 11 16:11:05 -0700 2016,Fri Apr 29 10:40:36 -0700 2016,Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,2,0

 Kamen is one of four childhood friends, and he's still close to Dave, Miles and Gould--the other principals of the Subs Club. They started the club to raise awareness within their community about bad Doms and much of that was due to the death of their dear friend, and fellow sub Hal, who choked in a public rope-play scene. Dave and Gould are still traumatized by this, as is Miles and Kamen, but Miles and Kamen seem to be getting past the grief--which upsets Dave and Gould. 
 Kamen's happy with his live-in Dom, Ryan, who is far smaller than Kamen, a burly athletic man. It's part of Ryan's attraction, actually, Kamen loves feeling like a dragon at the end of his diminutive Dom's leash. I seriously dug their dynamic. Kamen is totally gaga for Ryan, and gets frustrated that his peers are not so enthusiastic. It was bittersweet for him, and I thought it poignantly reflected that break in life, where that first serious relationship intrudes and makes a person less-available for the ""buds"" than they have ever been before. That resentment was clear between Kamen's bros and Ryan. 
 Within their apartment Kamen and Ryan indulge in play they have never considered previously. An errant pair of panties sparks a whole new level for them, with Kamen dabbling in not only manties but also drag. Then, a nasty altercation with ponygirl Cinnamon launches another new phase for them: pet play. (This type of play requires one of the partners to dress and act the part of an animal, while the other behaves as a trainer. It is not always sexual.) Cinnamon was present when Hal had died, and the Subs Club considers her to be Public Enemy #1, so joining the PetPlayFest competition with the intent to best Cinnamon at her own game is a vengeful step. 
 All of this seems odd and sordid, and I'll be honest, it is and isn't. It's fun and free and flexible and still damn funny, because Kamen is a rock star and does absolutely nothing by halves. He's never been into pet play but he dives in with and enthusiasm that is unquenchable. He and Ryan invest a ton of cash to purchase all the accoutrements, they build a cart (for the cart race, natch...) Kamen learns all about dressage and how to be the most graceful Thunder Canyon (that's his stallion name, yo) that he can be. 
 Through all of this, Kamen has to come to terms with his mostly adult life, and it seems to work out. I had some Whoa! moments where Kamen's awesome possum insight struck very close to the bone, and it made me love this book. The voice took me a bit of time to enjoy, because Kamen speaks like a twitter account, and I had to acclimate. After that, it was off to the races.",Sat Apr 09 09:20:06 -0700 2016,Sat Apr 09 09:22:28 -0700 2016,Sat Apr 09 09:22:28 -0700 2016,,1,0

She's pretty much hating on men when she comes across CB, Chance Bateman, a sexy biker boy who teases her at a rest stop. They meet up later when Chance's bike fails and Aubrey needs a tire change. He agrees to fix her problem, if she'll fix his: take him to LA. He sweet-talks her into it, and then proceeds to blow up Harrison's attempt at reconciliation by answering one of his ten-zillion phone calls that Aubrey keeps sending to voice mail. 
 Over the course of eight days-because Chance also talks Aubrey into checking out the Grand Canyon and Vegas, they develop a strong friendly bond, and bizarrely adopt a blind goat kid, but don't get anywhere romantically despite their combustible chemistry. Well, excepting their final night together. Which is everything Aubrey hoped for. Morning after? Not so much. 
 Fast forward two years. Chance had a debt to settle and it's now over. Can he win Aubrey back? Will she even let him back in the door now that she's finally gotten past her heartbreak? 
 The book is split into halves, first told by Aubrey second told by Chance. This allows us to access both character's heartbreak and determination to find love again-even with each other. I loved how Aubrey let herself go with Chance, who is as outlandish a man as she's ever met. He's not afraid to work hard, and has overcome many a disappointment in his personal and professional life, so going after Aubrey a second time gets his undivided and creative attention. He's endearingly arrogant, always focused on how to please Aubrey even when she wants nothing to do with him. 
 Aubrey isn't a heartless harpy. She's had two years of suffering, wishing, and waiting for Chance to simply contact her. To explain what happened in Vegas. He never did in all that time. So why should she let him now? After some good relationships and therapy, she's finally feeling secure enough to get serious, and has been dating a man for seven months. She isn't the type to simply walk out, even if Chance is literally knocking on her door and reclaiming the love of their blind goat-child. Unwilling to trust him with her heart, Aubrey allows him to work back into friendship, and that leads to more, to some degree. Chance is both determined and despondent, by turns, especially as he learns Aubrey has a time limit in her Temecula life-a new job prospect might take her cross-country yet again. 
 It's a very sweet book, with lots of fun, flirtatious bits. There's just a little bit of steam, and part of that includes a hot shower. I liked how resilient these two people are. They have had such difficulty finding a love that lasts, and it's not realistic to trust a person who has abandoned you, for sure, so I didn't begrudge Aubrey some time to really examine Chance and his intentions. The end is sweet an HEA as a reader could hope for.",Sun Apr 03 09:13:14 -0700 2016,Sun Apr 03 09:13:57 -0700 2016,Sat Apr 02 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,2,0

Because you must read it. I had never heard of the author, but what began as whispers in the M/M community soon became a resounding gong of praise for the books that were once an internet phenomenon but are now traditionally published. 
 For those who haven't read any of the books, Crown Prince of Akielos, Damianos, was captured by his elder half-brother's guard, chained and sent as a sexual slave to Crown Prince of Vere, Laurent, under the pseudonym ""Damen"". Vere and Akielos have had a truce since Damianos struck down Larent's elder brother in battle, and Laurent swears he will kill Damianos. Damen must keep his identity hidden to preserve his life, escape, and claim his throne, now that his father has died. That's rather difficult because Laurent--while he wants little to do with Damen--is unwilling to release him. Further, Laurent is in a difficult spot, his uncle the Regent king, seems to want to remain on the throne, and is willing to sacrifice Laurent in border patrol in order to cement his own reign. 
 As the book opens, Damen's true name has been revealed in the company of Akielian troops and he takes control of a fort, prepares to battle the Regent's army and command his smaller garrison win against awful odds. His commanders believe that Laurent is using him, and their worry is great considering the unconscionable issue of Damen, their king, being a slave to a prince--no matter how frigid all believe Laurent to be. Will Laurent try to kill Damen now that he knows his identity? It'sa real feal that Damen suffers--especially as the months of living together and campaining have brought a particular closeness to Damen and Laurent--one that Damen is loathe to sever. One that endangers Damen's alliances with his own generals, and causes the Veretians to balk, as well. 
 It was an amazing set of political gymnastics keeping the combined forces of Veretians and Akielians together, and just when it seems they will win back their thrones the full treachery of both Damen's brother and the Regent of Vere becomes known. I wasn't shocked, as I fully expected those revelations--due to excellent foreshadowing--but the manner of revelation springs yet another trap that threaten both Damen and Laurent with execution. The machinations were amazing, and kept the pace incredibly taut. Further, the love story between Damen and Laurent is not easy. They must work at it, and build it, just as with their alliances. It is a quiet affair, because there is so much scrutiny, and yet it is packed with sexual tension, longing, loss and satisfaction. That said, it's not terrifyingly graphic, so those who are not fans of same-sex pairing do not need to shun the books. In the whole three-book series, I bet there are less than 10 pages of actual sex (that's 1% of the page volume...) 
 As a series, this is one I'd enjoy again and again. The storytelling is superb, and the resolution is hopeful and mostly happy.",Thu Mar 24 17:31:13 -0700 2016,Thu Mar 24 17:32:45 -0700 2016,Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 -0700 2016,,1,0

They haven't kept in touch over the last couple years because Seth's controlling and abusive boyfriend, Tony, has isolated him from his few friends and family. Seth felt this was acceptable, to some degree, because he harbored a long-time crush on his straight best friend. A good boyfriend wouldn't talk to guys he finds attractive, right? And, especially not when his boyfriend doesn't want him to do so, right? Besides, Carter's at college, and he has a girlfriend. He doesn't want to hear Seth's troubles... 
 The book opens with Seth on a strange train platform, uncertain how he arrived there, and wondering how to get home so he can make Tony's dinner. Immediately the reader knows that something awful has happened to Seth, and that Tony has likely had some role in it. A ghostly train arrives and Seth steps aboard. The conductor gives him the low down--it's a train of souls on the way to their final destination. Thing is, Seth's not dead...yet. He has the power to step off the train at any station, as long as the doors remain clear to his vision. If he lingers, however, that option will disappear, and Seth will be dead. While Seth sorts out if he should disembark, he's shown to his cabin, and his roommate is Carter. 
 Carter has only 6 stops remaining until he's a lost soul. He knows this, knows he must make peace with himself and his choices, but he's struggling. He hid his disease from the two people he loved most in the world--Seth is one of them--and he's saddled with regret for never telling Seth that he loved him. 
 Even now, as they share space and final moments on this train, both Seth and Carter are shielding their deepest secrets from the other. Carter wants Seth off the train, right now, but Seth won't leave. He can't remember how he came to be on the platform, and he needs to solve this mystery before he decides if he wants to return. Did Tony beat him into a coma? Was is some other trauma? This makes a difference to Seth; he doesn't want to return to the living if he's only going to make the same mistakes. 
 Carter watches the stops tick off, and is unable to let go of his past--mostly because his love for Seth is so strong. When he finally confesses, it's not to the reaction he expected. Seth is angry that they never had their chance, and frustrated that Carter hid his bisexuality. They do work it out, over the course of the train ride, and they get their collective houses in order, too. 
 I'm not going to say more about the plot. It's fantastic, and heart-rending, and tumultuous. I feel better having read this book, not for any sense of spirituality, but for thinking about my own regrets and soul burdens, and considering how best to let them go. This is a love story, at it's core. Seth and Carter have an epic love for each other that was never acknowledged in life, but this ride of reckoning allows it time to bloom. 
 Small flashbacks allow the backstory to be inserted at poignant moments. The clock is always ticking, however, and Seth wishes to linger with Carter forever. Will he? Carter died young, and his regrets are many. Can he clear his soul and enter the afterlife? Or will he be one of the tormented lost souls that claw at the doors of the train whenever it stops? I will say that the book has a happy ending, even if it's not a convenient as it could have been. I liked that. Hard choices make for good conflict and interesting stories. At each turn we could have had the ""easy"" answer, and we really never get that, here, which is a credit to the story. I loved the idea of soul mates meeting as souls, and it's very well handled here. It's even a bit steamy, which was awesome.

 Leila and Jackson both have secrets. They are both haunted by families that have serious dysfunction--in Leila's case she's the ""other"" child. The one her congressman father only sees as a commodity to barter for political power. For Jackson, he's well, on the outs with his half-brother who runs their late father's company. At any moment, however, he might be needed to correct his brother's missteps. 
 Jackson's a well-respected football analyst with a fledgling sports network and he's earned the respect of many teams' management. He's wondering why the newly-hired sidelines reporter, Leila, is allowing their producer to speak down to her, as if she doesn't know anything about football. Jackson sees immediately that Leila's putting on an act--but why? 
 Thing is, Leila's a football guru. And a well-educated woman. Sports reporting is her dream job, the one she pursued when her beloved Gram died. Jackson's drawn to her--because he sees her intellect, and that's even sexier than her pleasingly-plump frame. Over the course of their time in the office each sees the little kindnesses the other extends to the rest of the staff. Leila's a big hit with the management, well, until her SOB of an ex reveals some of Leila's secrets involving sports gaming and gambling websites. It's all a wash, however, and she win's Jackson's trust completely. 
 Just when we think it's going to go completely right we get a squib kick to the guts. I don't want to give things away, but I'll say that Jackson's big bro is at the root of the problem, and he steadily endeavors to make things worse. There are some harrowing bits here, I won't lie about it. While Leila and Jackson pull through, they aren't quite together...for a bit. I so loved how each of them made sacrifices for the other, both assuming they'd never be a couple again. It was charming in an O. Henry Gift of the Magi sort of way. Expect an HEA, and a football fantasy come true.

 When last we left Will & Patrick they were still determined to get a divorce but separately acknowledged they each had real feelings developing for their spouse. Patrick was especially vulnerable, finally divulging his troubled childhood to Will, and finding Will to be sympathetic and supportive instead of disgusted. 
 In this episode, Patrick gets a crash course in mob mentality when Will's father, noted mafioso Tony Molinaro arrives in Healing SD. I absolutely love how Patrick and Will stand on their own two feet in this episode. And Mob Daddy's definitely pleased in the way that his son, Will, has grown. Tony never liked Will's ex-boyfriend, Ryan, and he sees the strength and independence that Will now exhibits as something engendered with Patrick's influence. 
 Will finally has the heart-to-hearts he's needed, perhaps for years, with his mom and dad. Their family dynamics are so messed up, and Will's issues are likely completely related to this dysfunction. 
 Patrick has his hands full managing his worries regarding a frivolous lawsuit, the indecent proposals he's facing from Papa Tony, and Will's medical issues. And, figuring out how to tell Will that he actually loves him. I really respected Patrick's resistance to being boxed up in the ""on the [Autism] spectrum"" excuse for his aloof behavior, and the assumed deficiency in his emotional ability as a result. He's honest, for the first time, with his feelings and wants desperately to own them, but can't find a way to communicate. His vulnerability is so poignant. Will accepts Patrick at face value, but wishes for more. He's not willing to imagine his life without Patrick in it, even after their divorce. If that DOES come to pass. 
 We shall see...I'm totally needing the final episode in this series. #Yesterday.

 Damen, who is also Prince Damianos of Akelios, was captured and sold into sexual slavery followed by a coup masterminded by his elder half-brother. Damen now slave to the Crown Prince of Vere, Laurent, must hide his identity in order to stay alive. Laurent's most fervent wish is to kill the Akelians, and is particularly frustrated that Prince Damianos, who killed his elder brother Auguste, died before Laurent could claim his vengeance. Damen's fervent hope is to return to Akelios and regain his throne, striking down his brother. 
 At age 20, Laurent is months from gaining his own throne from his uncle, the Regent king, who has served for the past seven years. Laurent's not interested in his slave Damen, except to torture him, at first. They have reached a rapprochement in the first book, as Damen convinced Laurent that he can help him survive the treacherous Akelios-Vere border patrol the Regent king has pressed Laurent into performing. 
 Laurent wants to live. Damen knows that keeping Laurent alive will prevent war between Vere and Akelios. Damen knows that Akelios will fall if war erupts, divided in loyalty as it has been by his brother's ascendancy. Damen is a born leader, having been proven a top commander and combatant in the wars against Vere. Laurent knows that Damen is strong and has a quick mind, but no one will follow the orders of a slave. That said, the commander of Laurent's troops--a rag-tag batch of mercenaries--is a pawn to the Regent who's likely been told to maintain disorder, enabling a poor defense for the Prince. Laurent fully expects that he will never see the crown, if his uncle has any say in the matter. 
 As with the previous book, the plot is rife with cunning and duplicity. Laurent must stay three steps ahead of his uncle's schemes, and he seems to do so. Damen, against his better instincts, advises Laurent admirably. He knows that he can slip off across the border and regain favor with his own people, but the entanglements the Regent has put in motion threaten to destabilize the entire region, and will undoubtedly cause war. 
 Damen trains Laurent's troops, under the guise of another officer, as well as becomes the ultimate protector of Laurent--who engages in espionage more than once. Damen's internal conflicts are many and fierce. Laurent is his sworn enemy, and would kill him if her knew his identity. Yet, their close quarters raises feelings of respect and admiration for the man that had brutally punished him previously. Also, the more that Damen is placed in battle, the more that his adversaries begin to see he is not a pleasure slave. He is a battle-hardened warrior, and resembles greatly the lost prince--threatening his anonymity. 
 I absolutely loved this story. The twists and turns are astounding. Laurent will stop at nothing to keep his life, and land, from war, even fighting his own lords to destroy the Regent's influence. The Regent is just as duplicitous, and has the might of the land on his side. Laurent, Damen and their troops are often outnumbered, and usually out-matched, and yet they persevere due to Damen's martial acumen and Laurent's bravado. I could not turn the pages fast enough. 
 The book series is a M/M romance, and we do see the elements build here. The first book: no intimacy. This book, some intimacy. Laurent is called the Ice Prince for good reason. (view spoiler)[(I'm betting that he hasn't had a ""lover"" in many years because he's a molestation survivor.) (hide spoiler)] That said, the long hours of travel, training, strategy and escape have welded Laurent and Damen together. Damen wants to escape and is simultaneously drawn to Laurent, not entirely out of duty. The print edition has a bonus chapter that really gets into the nitty-gritty of their intimacy. #Love 
 Still, it's a very, very small part of this story. Expect so much more. 
 The book, as part of a larger series, ends on a cliffhanger. The third book, Kings Rise, will decide who survives. My money's on Damen and Laurent. And not only as kings who share a border. I'm thinking these two will share a royal bedchamber, too.",Sat Feb 27 07:33:01 -0800 2016,Sat Feb 27 08:13:10 -0800 2016,Fri Feb 26 00:00:00 -0800 2016,,2,0

 The action begins with Prince Damianos of Akelios being captured, stripped and bound as a pleasure slave to Prince Laurent of Vere. Akelios and Vere are enemy nations under a tentative truce since their last war 6 years ago. The decisive battle in this war was the one where both the king and first born son were killed, and Damianos had bested the prince in hand to hand combat on the field. Prince Laurent, only 13 at the time, was too young to take the crown and Vere has been held by the Regent king, Laurent's pedophilic and profiteering uncle. ""Damen"" as Damianos is dubbed, has been made a particular gift for Laurent--who at 20 years of age is ten months shy of his coronation--by Damen's half-brother who has unlawfully assumed control of Akelios. See, everyone thinks Damianos has died, tragically, allowing the crown to fall to the usurper. 
 This is a taut political drama with plenty of intrigue. Laurent wants nothing to do with Damen. He hates all Akelians due to the loss of his father and brother in battle with them. He also hates his uncle, which this reader suspects has something to do with the Regent king's sexual proclivities and Laurent's own frigidity. 
 This is not a romance. Damen is smart enough to understand that his life hangs in a very dangerous balance. Were any of the Veretians to learn his identity he'd be killed. In the meantime, Laurent spares little thought to brutalizing Damen. There is a wary respect that develops as Damen makes requests that confuse and intrigue Laurent, particularly regarding the disposition of two dozen Akelian pleasure slaves that languish in Vere. True to the insight of Tsun Su, one can expect that Laurent knows his life is also in a precarious position. Ten months remain until he takes the throne and it seems his uncle has played a very deep game to cement his further rule. 
 This book is titled Volume One, and is part of a richly-written series. It ends with Damen and Laurent at a rapprochement. Laurent needs soldiers who will defend him against his uncle's schemes, and Damen knows that Laurent staying alive is the only thing keeping Vere from waging war on a divided Akelios.

 The title is completely accurate. Leanne and Nichole are women who suffer the same ailment: cheating husbands. Leanne is Nichole's mother-in-law who suffered 35 years in a loveless marriage to a philandering husband, Sean. When she learns that her son Jake is following Sean's misguided footsteps, she informs Nichole, stay-at-home mother to her only grandchild Owen. Nichole does what Leanne never had the strength to do: walks away. And this gives Leanne the courage to get a divorce as well. 
 The book opens two years after this marital discord, with Leanne and Nichole having apartments in the same building and having built a close and loving relationship. Leanne dotes on Owen and assists with childcare as Nichole struggles to provide for herself. Her divorce has not been finalized because Jake has blocked her at every step, in the effort to wear her down and coax her into returning to him. Sean had no compunctions regarding the loss of his marriage; couldn't wait to get Leanne out of his life and home. They'd maintained separate bedrooms for years. 
 In order to stay focused on the positive, and not get mired in depression, Leanne and Nichole build a ""guide"" of four tenets to see them through. They have to let go of their hurt, to volunteer, to build new friendships, and be open to new experiences. These principles form a strong foundation, but can't keep out all the hurt. 
 That said, it is through these outreaches that both Leanne and Nichole find new love for themselves and with new partners. Men who are completely different from their suave, wealthy, cultured ex-husbands are able to turn Leanne and Nichole's heads by being kind, compassionate, honest and sincere. The road to happiness is long, arduous and littered with missteps, however. I really admired these characters and how they kept their cool amid some contentious encounters. Jake is a selfish manipulative jerk who is unsettled by Nichole's desire to start over. His double standard is classic and nearly comical. Sean's got no interest in Leanne until he witnesses another man finding her attractive. And, yet, Leanne has some unfinished business with Sean that can only be handled with time and careful attention. 
 This is a heavy read. There is hope and heartbreak, in roughly equal measure. The ending is well done, with characters who make positive choices for themselves and find healing and happiness again. It was interesting to notice the details that were important to these women. Having been lied to to and cheated on, how they interacted with other men was measured and guarded. That felt so incredibly real, and approachable, as a reader. The love stories that build here are very sweet and so tender. That said, it's a squeaky-clean romance, with constant attention to religious interest--so I expect this will be a bestseller for the Christian readership. I had wished for a little more intimacy, to be truthful. Part of the book read like a journal, with both Nichole and Leanne speaking directly to the reader. It didn't unsettle me, as I prefer first-person close POV, but it might be an issue for other readers.

To recap: his is a steampunk YA romance set in 1850's England and both vampires and werewolves exist. Some mild spoilers may be present. 
 Sophronia has been at Mademoiselle Geraldine's for four years now, and she's sad that her bestie, and ardent admirer Soap--a black ""sootie"" (steamworks worker keeping the airship school afloat)--is no longer aboard the ship. He was gravely injured in the previous book, and Sophronia brokered his healing by pledging herself to serve the werewolf dewan--advisor to the queen. 
 Sophronia's still on the look out for the nefarious Picklemen who seek to discredit all supernaturals, and also control all the steampowered devices in the land. She catches these rascals on board the school, but they escape after completing some unknown purpose in the pilot's port. This later ties in to the Picklemen causing serious havoc with the school. 
 I do not want to give the plot away...at all, but Sophronia has her work cut out saving her friends and teachers aboard the airship. She'll be tested mentally, physically and emotionally and forced to cooperate with one of her former adversaries. The love story between Sophronia and Soap seems to be doomed--it is unsuitable by society's standards--but Soap's new status leaves him outside of society altogether. Is this is path for them? Will Sophronia survive the Picklemen's plot? It's a rather hair-raising ride across England and in the path of constant danger of not only marauders but an untethered vampire. 
 I simply adored this series. It's witty and fun, and frisky! There are some not-so-subtle hints toward burgeoning sexuality, male nudity, interracial romance, even...well, allusions toward outre lifestyles for some of the boys. It tickled me from the first page, and wrapped up the four-book plotline beautifully. I highly recommend reading the series.",Tue Feb 16 06:24:23 -0800 2016,Tue Feb 16 06:42:18 -0800 2016,Wed Feb 10 00:00:00 -0800 2016,,1,0

These people are called Therians, and after much civil unrest there is some level of peace between Humans and Therians. THIRDS is the Human/Therian defense organization that keeps the peace and apprehends rogue Therians, as they are very strong, and THIRDS squadrons are made up of equal numbers of humans and Therians. 
 Calvin and Hobbs are two twenty-fiveish best friends who are also in love with one another. Ethan Hobbs is a large tiger Therian who has Selective Mutism and crippling social anxiety. He is the youngest of three sons, and his father suffers a Therian-virus-related pain disorder. Watching his father suffer seemed to trigger Ethan's mutism. Some of his own family haven't heard his voice aloud in twenty years... 
 Calvin is human, and one of the only people that Ethan is able to regularly speak with, and even then only in close company, and still--only sometimes. They are partners in THIRDS and live together. Calvin has always loved Ethan, as a best friend, and later as a lover, but never told Ethan until recently--when Ethan was critically injured on a mission. It's been several months, and Ethan's not sure what to do. He returns Calvin's feelings, but he struggles to convey his love, being hampered by both his mutism and his anxiety. It was so poignant to be in Ethan's head, feeling his exasperation with himself, and wishing he could be a better (loving) partner to Cal. His eyes are opened in a new way while they sort things out--Ethan gets the full scope of the suffering Cal has endured by remaining his steadfast friend--some of which was intense bullying by humans at their low-income, low-quality high school. 
 Cal is a great guy, and partner, to Ethan, and makes his needs and wants, as normal and small as they may seem, known. It is Ethan who commits himself to bridging the gap. Working tirelessly, Ethan begins to expand his group of people with whom he can speak. It was so rewarding for him, and the reader, to observe these progressions. I think this book will certainly appeal to readers who have special needs persons in their lives, as the communication issues Ethan has mirror, to a degree, those present in many kids and adults on the autism spectrum. I loved having such a window into Ethan's condition. 
 The setting of working with THIRDS is interesting always on account of the police aspect. There danger is ever-present, and there is bloodshed in this book. People very close to both Ethan and Hobbs get injured and bad guys must be found. Also, loving must (and does!!) happen. While a new reader to the series may not know the full backstory on every character, there is certainly enough in this book to portray Calving and Ethan's love story and to pique interest for further reading.

 Tyler and Autumn are siblings. The book spans one day, one morning, when Tyler locks the student body in the auditorium and begins shooting, with purpose, those kids and teachers he believes wronged him. It also marks the second anniversary of the death of Autumn and Tyler's mother. She had been a prima ballerina, and died in a car wreck while driving to pick Autumn up from dance class. Since then their father has become an abusive drunk, mostly abusing Autumn, but sometimes Tyler when he stood up for his sister. 
 Autumn is a lesbian, in a relationship with Sylvia, a senior at the high school. Tyler has tried, unsuccessfully, forcefully, to break them up. His problems with Sylvia led to the end of his two-year relationship with Claire, and also cost him a few beatings from Sylvia's twin brother Tomas. Tyler was alternately described as a bully and a weakling. It was hard to ascertain his true character--outside of this maniacal spree. He quit school the spring before, and is today returning as a student. Well, that was his ruse. In the intervening six months, Autumn has hardly seen her brother, but he returned over Christmas break to goad their father into beating Autumn for dancing against his wishes. 
 Here's the thing, there's a lot of tension in the book, but it's all...terror, with little resonance. I had issues with some of the interactions, some of the thoughts. I am sure that kids in the crowd would be praying or in shock or wishing, hoping, for rescue, and some of that occurs, but there were definitely scenes that made little sense--like Tomas hoping that the cheerleader notices he comes to her rescue... Um? Get the F*** out. Ask her to prom next week, k? 
 As for the rescue, I was a bit stumped. If Tyler's so enthralled with Autumn's distraction, why does no one rush him--as hundreds of kids escape. I don't know. There were so many logical disconnects for me with this one. The awkward ""jokes"" the deliquents-cum-heroes tried to crack to each other. The convenience of five track runners training outside while the entire school sits in a mandatory assembly. The unrealistic physical layout of the school that would leave everyone trapped in an auditorium wing. It's a five year old building--I'm fairly certain that building codes would have dictated half a dozen fire exits with doors that cannot be locked to keep students in--only alarmed to alert egress. Classroom windows that lead to a roof? But, I digress. 
 There was a token attempt at diversity. Lesbian couple. Mexican-American farm kids. Black kids. The thing is, we barely knew anyone and then they were dying. I can find it sad, and a terrible waste, but it's hard to sympathize. To empathize. To mourn. The language was stilted and read a bit like an object lesson: don't ignore the signs of abuse, or else! There was little scratching of the surface of Tyler and Autumn's family tragedy, and continuing abuse. Both of these kids have ""loving"" partners who stand by and do nothing. Tyler assaults Sylvia. She does nothing. The kids in the auditorium...do nothing. 
 At the end of the day, I'm not a fan of tragedy porn. I don't look up stories on mass shootings. I raise my voice against the availability of guns and wish that we could change the powers that be so we can limit access and limit death. I know that my voice goes unheard because the laws do not change, and yet I still object. This book didn't seem to capture the emotional horror of a school shooting. There was too much happening, and little of it relevant. Few of the principals were present enough to be relatable and the end message was: Bad kid does bad things. That's too superficial, sorry, for a book where nearly forty kids and teachers are killed and nearly thirty more injured by one of their own. The Epilogue was preachy and ill-conceived. One student organizing a memorial rally via text? We've all seen the vigils on TV. They don't just ""happen.""

 Simon is a 17 y/o junior growing up in a suburb of Atlanta. His school is mixed and he has friends of color, notably Abby his close friend. His longtime friends Leah and Nick are kind and fun, but a bit more sedate than Abby who is a cheerleader and the object of admiration of many males. Firstly, Nick, who is simultaneously the crush of Leah. Makes for an awkward dynamic for Simon. Secondly, Martin Addison, a goofy, lanky boy in the drama club who is infatuated with Abby enough that he blackmails Simon to ingratiate himself into their ""group"". 
 See, Simon is a closeted gay teen, and he has an anonymous email pen pal--another gay teen (calling himself Blue) at his high school. They have been in contact for the past few months, using pseudonyms and decoy email addresses in order to safely explore their places in the world. The emails serve as a sounding board/confessional/journal for the boys and Martin intercepted these communications one day when Simon neglected to completely log out of the library computer. Martin's an (almost) decent kid who makes some seriously d-bag decisions, and Simon has to decide if he wants to go along with Martin's plans, or come out. And this is something he can't reveal to Blue because he's afraid that Blue will stop communicating with him to protect his own secrets. 
 It's a beautifully written teen romance with no steam and some real fun. There is limited angst, and when it does exist it's not all about the gay thing. Simon's nervous about the status of his friendships in general. Leah's frustrated about Nick liking Abby, and Simon always feels in the middle of that. Plus, Leah's disappearing more and more from their hang out time, and Nick's not helping by being ignorant to Leah's feelings. 
 On the homefront, Simon's got a rather supportive set of parents, even if his dad makes some off-color jokes regarding gays. Words he's later sorry for. I loved the family dynamic, and how close-knit it is. Simon makes a ""choice"" (under duress pretty much) to come out and that causes a bit of a ruffle, but not in the expected way. 
 I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I think even if I gave a verbatim account of the book it's STILL a worthwhile read. Simon's character is a fantastic sketch of today's youth. He's not quite sure why he has to come out as ""gay"" when all those around him don't have to reveal, or explain, their straightness. And, that's an interesting idea. When Simon becomes a ""topic"" at the high school his friends aren't just in his corner, they are ready to do battle. Even people who aren't his particular friends are willing to step forward on his behalf. It's a heartening scene, especially as it's set in the Deep South. that said, expect some instances of homophobia. 
 Also, I nearly wet myself when they all went to the ""gay""-borhood in Atlanta and Simon was a bit too adventurous. So sweet and cute and endearing. 
 In all, Simon's dearest wish is to meet Blue. After five months of sharing his most secret and personal self online he just wants to meet the boy he considers his boyfriend. Blue's so resistant, and when Blue discovers Simon's identity and still won't meet? It's more than a little crushing. 
 Don't fear though. The books sings with an HEA. It's just the right amount of tenderness, and there's no doubt that Blue is just as smitten with Simon. This is a book that I'd recommend to all readers of contemporary YA. It's completely innocent sexually, and has only a tiny bit of alcohol use. There is strong language at times, including f-bombs, which were not a trouble for me, especially as I was reading a 17 y/o boy's perspective. 
 I loved the diversity here. There are a few prominent black characters, and a couple who are Jewish, and others who have no religion and some who are religious and some who are gay, straight or bisexual. The mix was refreshing and fun and awkward and whole. I loved the meddling and the machinations, and the high school antics and hi jinks and the blessed union of Simon and Blue and and end that I never wanted to reach.

 Archer Noble (once Archie Noblesse) survived life as the eldest child of a drug-addicted Cree prostitute, and that included several years of sexual abuse from an uncle. He battled his way out, scraping money through theft and turning tricks until he could get legitimate employment and put his younger half-sister through college. Marguerite married and had two children before her husband died of cancer, and when the book opens Archer--now a vocal opponent against the heteronormatism of homosexuals--writes and speaks out against the need/right for same-sex parenting. His official stance is that love doesn't exist, that gay folk shouldn't bother with monogamy, settling down, or raising kids. They ought to enjoy their lives hedonistically with out the shackles of society, like marriage, weighing them down. 
 And then...the phone rings and he learns that Marguerite is dead, and he's the guardian of his nephew and niece-Dillon and Emma-two kids he's barely met. Marguerite also named her good friend, Ryan, as a stand-by guardian. When Archer arrives at Marguerite's he's overwhelmed and eager to pass the kids to Ryan, even if Ryan is just 25 y/o and gayer than gay. A total twink, and not the kind of gay man Archer either fancies or respects. Ryan is the ""picket fence"" guy that wants a solid stable partnership, and kids, and everything Archer detests. So, why not give him Margie's kids? 
 Ryan won't accept that, however. He knew Marguerite had a plan putting Archie in charge, and he's determined not to let Archie run off without a second glance. Ryan takes a hard-line stance, saying that he won't accept guardianship--even as it breaks his heart--but he will stay with Archer and the kids through the summer while school's out. During that time, Archer's supposed to be getting all the legalities in place to assume full guardianship. 
 Archer's not a nice guy. He's a cynical and jaded man who has scraped and scraped and learned to game the system wherever possible in order to survive. He's not proud of himself, and he's ashamed of his Cree heritage, which forever marked him as lesser in Manitoba where he grew up. He has no illusions of the past, and is sure his mother died alone, one of the many anonymous Native homicides that went unsolved at the time. Over their summer together, seeing Ryan's compassion, and Dillon and Emma's reaction to Ryan, is a watershed experience for Archer. He has no doubt that Ryan--a clearly gay man--is a fabulous parent. And, that he could never live up to Ryan's example. 
 Still, there's a romance building. Archer's rather adept at the Grindr. And he's got few scruples regarding hook-ups. He knew, as a Native, that addiction was one issue he'd face. As he didn't want to die young--like all his family--he chooses sex as his outlet for all frustration, rage or disappointment. Ryan puts his foot down regarding ""guests"" in the house. Ryan is attracted to Archer physically, and he's growing to love the man who is learning to raise Dillon and Emma, even if he doesn't like Archer's political activist viewpoints. He suspects he's not Archer's type but all the close quarters makes for tight connections. And Archer's narrow-minded view of caregiving and who should provide it is blown wide open. He observes Ryan, the patient, self-sacrificing man who's getting over his dream to marry his college sweetheart cheer on Dillon and Emma. Ryan's clearly still nursing a broken heart over the man who used him for a doormat, and Archer's shamed for having contemplated doing the same. 
 This is a slow burn, though Archer is definitely, and inexplicably, attracted to Ryan. He's drawn to his kindness and selflessness--and grateful that Dillon and Emma have someone so wonderful helping them through their grief. Through the days and weeks Archer becomes more comfortable in his role as guardian, and he's got some very tough choices to make regarding his career and his parenting. Ryan's summer comes to an end, and while he'd love to stay with Archer and Dillon and Emma, he realizes that he deserves more of a relationship than ""the manny"" role he assumed at Marguerite's death. It's a bittersweet moment, but it's not the end. Both Ryan and Archer have to make some compromises to their life plans, now. And those compromises work. The book is an HEA, but I will warn readers it's very low steam. Also, expect some unintentional cockblocking by grieving kids who need drinks in the night. 
 I loved the tenderness. I loved the ethnicity and inclusion. I loved the enemies to lovers premise that I felt was really well-written and balanced. I liked the progressive growth of the dynamic between Ryan and Archer. Ryan is a gem, and Archer was a fool to let him walk away--but not nearly as big a fool as Ryan's ex, who let him get away twice. I wished for more steam, and some sexytimes that happened on the page, not just the ""aborted"" trysts. That said, this is a tender family drama with a stellar interracial romance.

He puts in extraordinary hours as he has nothing else to do with himself. He's a deeply-closeted gay man who's hidden his orientation ever since that fateful day he was expelled from school for having a dalliance with a schoolmate--and that wasn't even the worst that happened to him that day. 
 Ed is a newly-minted attorney, back in London and seeking employment. The weekend before he's due to report at a firm as a temporary associate, he's out with his flatmate and gets picked up by a suave wealthy older man. Alec. Their connection is immediate. Ed's not a player, and he doesn't go for older guys, per se, but something about Alec's swagger turns him on. And, it's the same for Alec. He usually hits on mealy-mouthed younger men who'd never challenge him in any way, but Ed stands up for himself. Demands a drink and some conversation before he allows himself to be wooed. 
 Their night together is incendiary. Neither has the guts to call it quits, and they share Alec's bed in his barren home. The morning after is worse than shite, but it becomes all the more complicated when Ed turns up as the temp on Alec's team handling a huge hotel merger. Alec's so fearful of Ed revealing his dark secret, and Ed's a peach. 
 Lookit, I loved the book. I didn't always love Alec, but Ed--he's a dream. A good dream. The kind you wake from and immediately wish you could fall back to sleep into. He's kind and charming and funny, and hardworking--even surpassing Alec's insane work ethic. Alec's in turmoil. He's so attracted and so scared and so bitter seeing Ed immediately admitting to his sexuality and that being accepted without a qualm. Alec's been carefully cultivating a hetero persona in the office, using a longtime friend as a beard. He's fearful that coming out now will convince his workmates that he's a liar, and jeopardize his partnership hopes. 
 It's all very real, and the romance that brews is so bittersweet. Working together for days on end becomes a struggle for both of them--and Alec gets vindictive at one point. The result: pure passion. 
 I thoroughly loved the loving here. And the parts of tense separation only stoked the fires. They are honest with each other. Alec does not want to come out. Ed will not be a dirty secret. There seems to be no accord to be made, and yet Alec knows the only way to find happiness for himself is to take it. To make it happen. He has real fears of being ostracized in his family, and makes a choice to be honest--and to reveal why he hid his true self for so long. The emotions will run high for the reader, I think, without being caught in too much angst. 
 The HEA is real, and spectacular. Highly recommend.",Sat Jan 30 09:12:48 -0800 2016,Thu Feb 04 15:06:56 -0800 2016,Tue Jan 26 00:00:00 -0800 2016,,8,0

 Delirious with stars for this fast-paced, espionage-packed, odd-couple, steampunk, alt-history, scorching hot, M/M romance. 
 I do love me some steampunk, and this book brings alt-historical steampunk on strong--along with the romance, the yearning, the lovin' and the sexin', too. The world is a glorious alt-historical 1910's era Europe with France having conquered vast swatches of the continent, and in continual battle with Austria. The main fuel source is aether, a gaseous mix that's mined in Austria and coveted by the French. It powers mighty dirigibles that are used to make war and trade. 
 Cornelius is the notorious gay exhibitionist bastard son of the Archduke of France. Conny's father who aims to ""unite"" all of Europe by force. Peace through subjugation, it seems. As a master tinker's apprentice, Cornelius is well versed in designing and implanting clockwork parts into people. He happens upon a barge stack high with dead Austrian soldiers, he's overcome with grief over his father's eternal war and the huge loss of life that is its toll. Then one of the men moves, and Cornelius' soft heart compels him to rescue this man, even though he is an enemy. Any that he can save is a knock against his father, to Conny. 
 His Austrian soldier is a big man with many, many terrible injuries. He requires an entire leg graft, a partial leg graft, a new arm and all of this is not a trouble to Cornelius. What is, however, a problem is the shrapnel in the man's chest. The only way to fix this stranger is to give him a clockwork heart. And, Conny's tinker-master, Felix, had created just this fearsome thing many years before. It is both priceless and dangerous, and Conny steals it to heal his soldier. 
 As Johann heals, he finds himself a monster--what he had feared becoming if he fell into French hands. Initially, all the clockworks freak him out, and he's sure that he's now one of the automaton soldiers the French are rumored to be building. Despite the language barrier, Conny is able to convince Johann of his kind intentions. Conny's flamboyant friends, notably Valentin, are not happy that Conny is not out socializing in their local bawdy cafe, and this brings Conny to disguise Johann as an air pirate, and masquerade him as his lover. Johann has no experience in loving...anyone. He's just 18, a soldier since a young age, and a deserter, truth be told. Conny has no idea how prescient his ""pirate"" disguise was. 
 This is a rather tense adventure with several escapes, lots of daring rescues, and a whole lot of falling in love. Conny and Johann strike up a tentative, tender romance, and the sexytimes could melt a glacier. I will confess that their bond involves role play, clockwork ""toys,"" fantasy, and even a bit of menage. These are very different, very liberal times, with the use of cocaine-laced absinthe to spark a whole lot of amorous exchanges. Expect orgy scenes--which was fine by me. 
 I was captivated by the lush descriptions and deep plotline. I never felt the plot bog, not once, and could not stop turning the pages. The book is the first in a series, and I expect the next Clockwork Love book will center on a different lovestory, though I'm anxious to have more of Johann and Conny.

I've read the first three and while the romance was slow to build--it truly began in the third episode--it is in full force now. While technically a novella, it's over 40K words--so it's a juicy read that'll keep you occupied for hours. 
 Summary of the past three books: Will and Patrick have lived in the honeymoon suite of the Tallgrass Hotel in Healing South Dakota ever since their drunken ""I Do""s in Vegas in early November. It's now the beginning of January and they have finally consummated their marriage--twice. They cannot get a quickie divorce because doing so will cause Will to lose control of the Molinaro Trust--former mafia money that he has funneled into Good Works, a multimillion dollar humanitarian foundation. Patrick had lost his staff position in Atlanta and is now the chief neurosurgeon in the new Healing Hospital that Good Works has funded. Will had an emotionally abusive partner, Ryan, whose callous phone break-up triggered Will's Vegas bender, and Will's a recovering alcoholic and diabetic that Patrick has managed to keep healthy and sober for their entire marriage (barring the wedding night!). 
 In this episode, FIGHT THEIR FEELINGS, that's exactly what's going on. Will and Patrick have finally become sexually active, much to their mutual delight. Will has a lot of baggage to unload regarding sex, in part because his and Ryan's sex life was horrendous and in other part because his family has rather peculiar ideas about sex, and homosexuality. 
 Will felt guilty having relations with a person whom he didn't ""love"" but Patrick is someone that he does love--though he holds back from hoping/wishing/praying that they have a future together. Patrick continues to make it clear that he's only sticking around until they can manage to get divorced. But that's because Patrick doesn't want to admit that he's hopelessly in love with Will. 
 See, because he's fighting his feelings... 
 This is a real emotion-driven episode with both Will and Patrick airing their vulnerabilities and asking for absolution in the only way they can. I liked it so, so much. Also, the sexytimes. GAH! Smoking hot and not skimping on the deets. Expect a bit of kink to make an appearance. (I don't consider that a spoiler as it's part of the disclaimer at the front of the book.) 
 The connections deepen. Will and Patrick build strong bonds that both satisfy and frighten them. And, of course, just when I think these guys are FINALLY on track, well, Will's family manages to screw it all up. Again. Perhaps. 
 I'm going to leave you with this song, this freaking song that always brings tears to my eyes, and pretty much sums up Patrick's feelings for Will.

 4.5 Stars for this adult contemporary romance. 
 **SPOILER ALERT**(of Hearts in Darkness...because it's super relevant to the second book!) 
 So, Makenna and Caden met two months ago when they were trapped in an elevator for hours. Caden is a paramedic; he chose this profession because his family was in a horrific wreck when he was fourteen, and he was trapped for hours upside-down in a drainage ditch with no assistance. His father was unconscious and his mother and younger brother were killed. His family shattered that night, with his father living a half-life that had no love or affection for anyone, not even Caden. Caden still suffers PTSD and claustrophobia as a result of the wreck, but he's a damn good paramedic, and thrives on his level-head while assisting people in emergencies. While trapped in the elevator Makenna helps Caden with his clautrophobia-induced panic attack. They bonded over them each losing their mothers when young--Makenna's mom died when she was a toddler. 
 Fast forward to Thanksgiving. And LOVE IN THE LIGHT. Caden hasn't had a family holiday since the car wreck. He usually works overtime at the firehouse so guys with families can have the holiday off, but Makenna's family wants to meet him, so they drive to Philly. There, Caden has to face the gauntlet of Makenna's three brothers and father. He actually holds his own, despite his anxiety, and is even able to tolerate the appearance of Cameron--bestie of Makenna's brother Ian and also Makenna's former serious boyfriend--former fiance, truth be made clear. And Cameron's sure he wants Makenna in his life. 
 This book is told from both Caden and Makenna's POV, so we get to experience the highest of highs and lowest of lows. And boy howdy, does it get dark. Caden's been asymptomatic for PTSD for a while, but he finally has someone real in his life--Makenna--to lose. And Cameron, successful, attractive doctor, is certainly better-suited to giving his beloved Makenna a far better life than Caden can. Right? 
 Enter depression and complete freak out and Makenna having her own sincere challenges--that include a pushy Cameron, medical issues, and an unshakable love for Caden. This is a romance that started with an HEA, got mired in the depths of depression, and worked hard to find the light of love. And succeeded. As a depression survivor, the descent into darkness that Caden experiences is eerily reminiscent of my own personal history. The love that Makenna has, and Caden has for that matter, are really intense. Life is not easy, as they both learn, and--what may be more relevant: life doesn't wait for you to get your act together. So many good parts of the book that touched off memories for me--big family, lots of nosy siblings, ulterior motives, and the helplessness/hopelessness of depression. 
 The end is a bit of a thrill ride, with Caden facing his worst fears and coming out on the side with joy he never dared to dream. While Makenna tells a lot of this story, I really felt that Caden's journey was more compelling. Mostly because she's being excellent and supportive and dealing while Caden is a complete wreck inside and out that must get fixed right this time. 
 I wonder if we'll hear more of their love story, but even if we don't...I'm sure they make it.",Mon Jan 11 14:32:43 -0800 2016,Mon Jan 11 15:13:33 -0800 2016,Fri Jan 08 00:00:00 -0800 2016,,0,0

 4.5 Stars. 
 Mark is a 39 y/o closeted gay man, who is recently divorced from his wife and assumed custody of their 14 y/o daughter Fen. His ex-wife is the only one he's told of his sexuality, and he thinks he's been canny enough that no one will suspect. He's given up his lucrative career as a tax advisor (one of those blokes who tells the uberwealthy where to hide their money from the taxman) and moved out of London into Shamwell, a countryside village that is the location of all books in this series. 
 Mark hasn't had regular contact with Fen in a long time. Even when he lived with her, he was basically a workaholic and hardly saw her. He has fond memories of her being a doting child and immediately thinks he can quell her spate of rebelliousness--that which got her expelled from her school--by installing her in a private school in Shamwell. Oh, poor deluded father. Fen has no trouble giving dear old absentee dad the raw side of her tongue. Or, well, the silent-but-haughty treatment. Don't get the wrong idea about Fen, she's aces. 
 Patrick is a 25 y/o aid worker who is well-out as bisexual, and still gets along mighty well with the locals in a men's social group, the Spartans Society. He meets Mark when Mark shows up for the club, and begins going out with the group. Patrick's drawn to Mark, but Mark puts him off. He doesn't want to tip Fen off about his sexuality. (Oh, poor deluded father!!) Funny thing, Fen KNOWS all about Daddy Dearest, even if he doesn't wish it so. 
 I adored how addled Mark was regarding being a parent. I guess I thought he had it coming to him, on account of being a bit pompous and overconfident and still endearingly oblivious. He felt like he was so slick, and so savvy and this 14 y/o girl thwarted him, and befuddled him, and figured him out and played him, by turns. In truth, Patrick owes that girl a life-debt, as she was the one who not only addressed her father's closet full of skeletons, she pushed her father to find a new partner. Fen, for herself, wants a stable family. And she doesn't care if she has two dads in her home. At all. Turns out two of the people she most bonds to in the book are Mark's flamboyant gay former-assistant, and Lex the genderfluid assistant to Patrick. 
 There's some issue issues between Patrick and Mark regarding Mark's former job as a tax (cheat's) advisor. This has to do with social services in England, and the lack of them when people don't pay their taxes. It was a very minor part of the story. I liked it for my own self, mostly because I'm rather sanctimonious about people paying their ""fair share"", but I doubt that's the case for every reader. That said, its a SMALL part of the narrative and the one part that Patrick's mother--a bit of ""tarty"" lady who disapproves of her son's choice in partner--actually tries to smooth over. 
 There isn't too much heat here. There were a few frustrating interrupted trysts and false-starts (for the characters and myself) Every time Mark and Patrick seem to get things rolling there's an interruption--for the first two-thirds of the book. That said, I liked the book a lot. It's funny and smart and I loved that Fen was so great a kid. That girl has a right head on her shoulders. I did really like Patrick, and I liked how Mark had to really grow up, and become the adult he'd rather been playing at his whole life.

It features a supremely unlikeable MC, Mercedes, a high school senior who is spending her un-chaperoned nights sexually-educating the clueless virgins of her high school. 
 Yep. Guys nervous about your first time with your girlfriend? Call Mercedes. On the super-down-low, though, as you wouldn't want your actual girlfriend to find out you had a one-nighter with another girl. 
 Okay--so THIS BOOK has a trainwreck plot. Mercedes is a smart girl, awaiting her MIT acceptance, with a wealthy father she hasn't seen in three years and a Cali socialite mother whose longest relationship has been with her plastic surgeon. Kim, as Mercedes calls her mom, is despicably clueless and emotionally abusive. Mercedes has been wholly shamed into strict diets and couture life, with little to no parental affection. I know, I know...poor little rich girl. Still, the absence of parenting leaves Mercedes vulnerable to predation when she's young--and her own first time was little more than acquaintance rape by a manipulative older boy when she was thirteen. 
 And, Mercedes doesn't want the fumbling firsts for other girls. She's sure her ""good deeds"" will be of benefit, but she's rapidly sucked into some rotten scenarios under the misapprehension of control. Mercedes thinks basically anonymous sex will protect her from the hurt/pain of connection with another human. Also, she thinks setting the mood and being in her own sanctuary--her boudoir--will provide control to a situation that is fraught with intimate danger. All of these fallacies become plain to Mercedes as the story goes on. (As the train builds steam going around that blind curve...) 
 Boys talk. They do. They find a way to use her ""service"" to their own end, and Mercedes falls into a shame spiral. That's nothing compared to the shock and EEW of finding herself on the bad end of a one-sided fascination from her best-friend Angela's virgin boyfriend, Charlie. 
 Mercedes has few friends. She admits to being bad with people. Really bad. She has excluded herself from the regular company of god-bothering Angela, because Angela's all about ""saving herself"" and Mercedes has (essentially) been ""ruined"" since 8th grade. And, the virgin thing started at the beginning of senior year--so their friendship has become more strained. As more and more boys fill up Mercedes' log book, Mercedes finds herself more estranged, and seeking further validation. She sets up a regular sex date with her lab partner, Zach, who is a remarkably open-minded guy. 
 Zach is a great guy, really, and only wants to date Mercedes. He loves her, and is thwarted from telling her, well, by Mercedes who doesn't want that closeness. New girl Faye also turns Mercedes' head. There's an open flirtation there, and it looks like Faye and Mercedes might hit it off, but Charlie's lurking in the background and doing really REALLY nasty (and illegal) things to ensure his place in Mercedes' bed--all without Angela finding out. 
 Expect there to be video fall out. Expect there to be slut-shaming and fighting and angry girlfriends and electronic humiliation and public airing of a pseudo-sex tape. All while NOT ONE ADULT is the wiser. (That sound you heard? That was a a big huh? from me.) 
 What I liked about this book: 
 1. The ""Life Goes On"" message. Mercedes is called to account and harassed, assaulted and nearly raped a second time. Her closest friends stick by her side. They go above and beyond the pale to help cast Mercedes' deeds into Yesterday's News. 
 2. Mercedes learns that her value exists in herself, and that friendship is a valuable endeavor. Mercedes doesn't believe herself worthy of love or affection--and finds it hard to accept those overtures, from anyone. At first. 
 3. There are no easy resolutions in life. When you upset people, you have to bear the results of that--not regarding the episodes of assault on school property, however. That shoulda been nipped in the bud by administration. And the Sharpie attacks on her locker would have been painted over by my kids' schools toot-sweet--not left to languish in all their slur-ry glory... 
 4. Realistic, if crappy, response to Mercedes' shenanigans. I'm not a fan of slut-shaming, but this book is actually designed to take on slut-shaming, by being sorta sex positive. So one must endure the firestorm of hate to ""endure"" it, in Mercedes' life. 
 Stuff that made me set the book down for a bit: 
 1. Trainwreck plot. As a mature woman, I have perspective that Mercedes lacks. I knew her little enterprise would become public knowledge from the outset. When it all got to be TOO much--especially Charlie's overtures--I needed to take a break. It's no fun turning every page and wanting to smack the narrator twice. 
 2. Lack of punishment for Mercedes' attackers, be they physical or sexual. I had a hard time believing that Charlie's ""punishment"" was being outed as a jackass who spilled the beans.What he actually did was criminal, and should have resulted in some legal repercussions. The hallway tormentors also got off with no notice. In what world, I wondered. 
 3. The double-standard of girl versus boy ""promiscuity"" was only barely scratched at. 
 No one is going to find Mercedes or her actions likable. She doesn't particularly like herself very much, for reasons other than her sexual activity. I believe, however, that some readers will find her sympathetic. Back in my younger days, we had the ""Jerry Springer"" standard for decency. If your actions didn't get you called in as a ""guest star"" on the seedy Jerry Springer Show, then you were still ""decent."" Mercedes has a distinct ""Jerry Springer"" vibe, which makes sense. 
 All the best trainwrecks appeared on that show. 
 That said, the book is interesting as a study in moral contrasts and contemporary puritinism. FIRSTS is clearly going to a challenged book for the very fact that kids haz sex, and not just a little bit, in this book. Don't hope for fade-to-black, everything plays out in cringe-worthy living color.

 Chad is the bad boy younger brother of Marley (MC from a previous book) and shows up at her house on the promise of 1. free food 2. free drink. That's where he ""meets"" ""Bow Tie,"" a svelte geeky member of Marley's staff at GAMERS magazine. Bow Tie ties Chad's guts into knots when he doesn't immediately fall for Chad's come hither. The wearer of the eponymous bow tie, Owen, (or: Oh-Oh-Owen because Chad wants to give him an ""Oh! Oh!"" face, not because of a stutter!!) is interested, but not willing to let on how inadequate he feels in the presence of sexy-sexy Chad. 
 Owen wants Chad, bad, but doesn't want Marley--his direct superior--to find out about their bathroom shenanigans, or supply closet shenanigans. Or that time they did it on the floor... Meanwhile, Chad wants more floor time. Or naked in the park time...or any time with Owen. 
 Chad's always felt like a ne'er do well after flunking out of college. He pays his bills, and lives alone, but he can't stick with a job. He has aspirations in graphic design, but doesn't know if he has the staying power to commit to going back to school. And how would he pay for it anyhow? Plus, Owen's whole life had been commitment-phobic. He's bisexual (some people claim that's a commitment thing--not me, but it was there), and his longest stint at a job is his current one--four months as a topless bartender. Chad's starting to realize that this is not the best life for a 27 y/o man, and one who sincerely desires a successful man like Owen to find him desirable. 
 Trouble is, Chad's immature. Turns out that it might be better if he'd been forced to stick it out--in anything--because then he might have learned conflict resolution skills that are better than juvenile. Every time Chad gets upset, it seemed, he did the adult-equivalent of yelling ""You're a poop-head"" and taking his ball home from the park. (Which, honestly was pretty close to what he actually did.) 
 I adored Owen, who is a fully-functional adult. He may not be happy with Chad's behavior but he endeavors to root out the cause, instead of being smug. I guess finding the person to challenge him was what Owen needed. And, he helps Chad grow up. Chad decides to do some growing up of his own, on his own. Marley's there as a confidante, and there's a big part of the plot that hinges on Marley's boyfriend Austin's very public, very cosplay wedding proposal, and that keeps Owen and Chad in very close proximity when they would ordinarily not see each other. As a device it wasn't too obtrusive, and the proposal scene will definitely satisfy readers of the predominantly M/F romance series. 
 This is a quick read with steamy sexytimes and delicious dirty talk. Expect pornographic graphic arts and bow ties to go where no bow ties have gone before... HEA All The Way.

 Tover Duke is one of 42 navigators in the galaxy. He is esteemed by all for his ability to shift cargo and people, using only his voice and some sophisticated technology and body implants, to great distances across space, and is well paid for his service to the Harmony Corporation. He loves his beautiful hotel suite home, and his aviary stocked with tame birds, but he doesn't love how he has to sneak around to find men for his pleasure. Harmony Corp doesn't approve of same-sex relationships, and Tover has had to hide behind trysts with women. He has one special man he routinely seeks out--Cruz, an engineer who occasionally pops into the space station where Tover lives and works, but those reunions are few and far between. 
 On Tover's 30th birthday there's a huge celebration--and it's interrupted by the advent of a disheveled Cruz popping in and taking Tover hostage. Cruz convinces Tover to ""jump"" them both to a remote space station. As soon as they arrive, Tover is taken into custody, and traded to pirates aboard the station to secure the release of Cruz and his associates. (It seemed clear that this was the best of a lot of bad options for Cruz, and one he agreed to reluctantly.) While imprisoned on the pirates' vessel, Tover is beaten and tortured for his unwillingness to assist moving the pirates' cargo. 
 He's rescued later, but the damage has been done. His torture has resulted in psychological damage that causes him physical and visceral pain whenever he even considers ""jumping."" That doesn't bode well for Tover's illustrious career in transport. While recuperating in a locale that's surrounded by enemies, Tover begins to see that his early life was not a roasy as it seemed, and his work for Harmony not as straight-forward. Cruz is back, and his true colors are shown in a way that earns Tover's grudging acceptance. 
 I loved how this story worked. It had excellent elements of futuristic life, and technological elements that thrilled my inner-geek. The love story between Tover and Cruz is rocky, but took it's natural course toward an eventual and appropriately delayed HEA. In the reading I was struck by parallels to Dune: galaxy-bending transport, falling in with a native of a foreign world, understanding and championing the underdog against a galactic behemoth hierarchy. 
 I've had this one in my TRB for too long, and relished the rich world-building. I think the big disappointment I had was a lack of the dialogue/culture uniqueness. Cruz and his associates speak Spanish, and have a deeply Hispanic culture. While I liked that there was some cultural inclusion, it was not terribly different from today's speech or manner. And, that was my disappointment. Having been a long time fan of the richness of alien culture (think Enemy Mine, think Star Trek etc) having these CO2-breathing humanoids sit down to a table full of tamales was...anti-climactic. It's like having a Klingon sit down to the traditional feast of hamburgers. That said, the story was truly compelling and the love story one to root for. There are few sexytimes, but what exist are tender and passionate. I really enjoyed this one and hope there might be more work in this world to enjoy.

 Sayer is on her own for the first time in her life, but that doesn't mean she's left her baggage back in Seattle. Six months ago her father died dropping the bombshell that he'd fathered another child--Rowdy from the Marked Men books. Sayer's mother committed suicide while Sayer was in her teens, and her father was an emotionally abusive man who found fault with everything Sayer did--including crying at her mother's funeral. It's not been easy to open herself up to Rowdy and his friends, but she's trying hard to rebuild her life. 
 In doing so, she buys a beautiful historic home that needs renovation. For this job Sayer hires Rowdy's good friend Zeb. Zeb had spent 2 years in jail for assaulting his sister's abusive partner. Since then, he's put all his effort into being a model citizen, including starting his construction/renovation business from scratch and hiring guys with criminal histories, training them to be overcome their past and develop a worthwhile trade. Zeb makes no secret of his attraction to Sayer, and while she'd like to sate her desire for more with Zeb, she's so ingrained with insecurity thanks to her daddy issues it's hard for her to relax around him. 
 Before they can even begin to gain ground together Zeb needs Sayer in a professional capacity. Sayer's not thrown off by Zeb's past--or present--she only feels unequal to the strong love she knows he gives unflinchingly. Watching both Poppy and Beryl, strong women friends who have overcome physical abuse, gives Sayer a guide to dig her true self out from beneath her callous mask. While Sayer helps Zeb she becomes more and more involved in his life, and the relationship they both wanted begins. It's still a hard path, but I liked how they were honest--even when it hurt and meant temporary separation. 
 I don't want to give away too much, but I think readers are REALLY going to love Zeb. He is a stand up man, who takes on too much responsibility for others, perhaps. He does the hard work for himself and Sayer, and his steadfast love is the balm to her chafed heart. I think he's one of the best hetero male leads I've read in a long time. There's not too much sexytimes, though when it happens it's yummy. Readers may not find Sayer approachable--and that's by design. I still could appreciate her compassion, even if I didn't connect with her self-loathing. The end is a spectacular HEA.",Tue Dec 29 09:00:58 -0800 2015,Tue Dec 29 09:04:46 -0800 2015,Tue Dec 15 00:00:00 -0800 2015,,3,1

Amelia is about to celebrate her second anniversary with her trust-fund brat boyfriend, Jay, in Maui with a hard-earned vacation when she loses both her job and the cheating cheater all in a few hours. Packing up all her belongings, and her eccentric Aunt Zarafina, Amelia's all ready to enjoy her all-inclusive vacay and perhaps kick start her life island-style. 
 While there, Amelia--a former concierge at a boutique hotel--sees the kitschy Palekaiko Beach Resort for it's former glory. It's now a bit run-down, and Amelia places the blame for that on the absentee owner the uptight and tightwadish Samuel Kinkaide. Amelia can't help getting involved with the thin-stretched staff, and falling a bit for beachcombing snorkel instructor ""Dude;"" if only she knew Dude = Samuel. 
 This is a breezy read with some seriously fun moments. I liked the development of the love story between Amelia and Dude (and eventually Samuel). There are some great insights to island life, including great elements of dialect and the shady underpinnings of the mafia. I loved how Amelia took charge of her world, and built something good for herself. Her psychic Aunt Zarafina is a trip--and I adored the close bond they shared. I was glad that Amelia and Samuel were able to get onto the same page, and work together. LIFE'S A BEACH is set as the first in a series, but I suspect other characters will find love matches in the books to come. The sexytimes are yummy, and the plot is fun, fun, fun. I was able to soar through this in an afternoon.

 First off, Noah is a dedicated archeology professor seeking tenure in his ultra-right wing west Texas Christian university. He's a reclusive, closeted, 35 y/o man, sharing company only with his dog, Ulysses, for years now. The pressures of publishing are weighing on Noah, who's taken a sabbatical term to write a research book. At a desolate RV campground just outside of some of his dig sites, Noah's quiet is disturbed when the RV parked beside his erupts in turmoil, leaving a flamboyant young man and his sweater-clad Chihuahua-mix, Pixel, standing in his stocking-clad feet watching his newest boyfriend depart with their rented RV and all of his belongings. 
 Talk about awkward. 
 Noah takes pity on Adrian, offering him temporary shelter in the event that Trent returns. Yeah, not so much. Adrian is despondent, not just because this is yet another failed long-distance relationship, but because he and Trent were supposed to bond on the drive to Denver to attend his sister's wedding. Adrian just cannot show up alone, because reasons (which are valid!) and he doesn't know what to do. 
 Noah's not inclined to give up his precious writing time--with a serious deadline looming--but he can't get over how drawn he feels to Adrian. Yeah. That kinda drawn. Attraction, something that Noah has squelched in all its insidious forms for years now, is burning him inside out and twisting him around. Hearing all of Adrian's sob story he's just, well, he's just going to drive him to Denver, dang it! 
 Thing is, along the way, Adrian discovers some very real truths about the good professor. 1. He's gay 2. He's closeted 3. He's sexy 4. He's celibate 
 Adrian would LOVE to erase number four from the list, but only if Noah's a willing participant. While they endure bad traffic, blizzard conditions and a budding mismatched dog friendship, Adrian and Noah become very, very close. Noah has been able to stifle his sexual desires, but the experience of companionship that he feels--for the first time--with Adrian is hard to get over. So, why shouldn't he try? After all, Noah's on sabbatical. His contract's morality clause is ironclad, but what harm is there in enjoying Adrian in his RV home, relishing tea made to order and soothing neck rubs? If he takes these few days, Noah thinks, and even a few weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, to share his life with a kind and compassionate man, he could build up memories that would sustain him in his life as a celibate man. (PS--this troubles Noah more because he feels as if he's taking advantage of Adrian's good nature, not because he feels sex is necessarily sinful...) 
 I seriously laughed out loud experiencing an epic ""I volunteer as tribute"" moment. In the meantime, Adrian and Noah bond over their mutual love of videogames--Adrian is a coder for a crowdfunded MMORPG that Noah has supported. They really connect, sharing other interests like bad 80s sci-fi and gay fiction. 
 Adrian is so supportive of Noah's sheltered life, never condescending over the reasoning behind Noah's reluctance to ""come out."" The tenderness was an 11, for real. And the sexytimes are hawt. Appreciative and timid Noah is a great match for Adrian, who's been criticized by partners for being too aggressive, and too picky in his bedplay. The way they work it out together is spicy and sweet, pour on the heat. Yum. 
 Expect some big changes for the good professor, and all for the best. Expect Adrian to stand up for himself, and Noah, and vice versa. Great emotional depth, and positive supporting characters, are present, too. This is the beginning of the #gaymers series, and I think we got a hint about the MC of the next book near the end of this one.",Fri Dec 04 07:31:29 -0800 2015,Fri Dec 04 07:32:22 -0800 2015,Thu Dec 03 00:00:00 -0800 2015,,2,0

Other characters in the series show up here, and that's cool, but you don't have to know their stories for their involvement to make sense. 
 4.5 stars. 
 Tom and Reese met in college and have been an exclusive couple for five years. They graduated a few years back and both work full-time in Boston. Tom's working in finance, and doing part-time school for an MBA and Reese is a receptionist/office gopher for a clothing concept company. Things have been going pretty well for these two, but with work and school, they are a bit on relationship autopilot, and their connection is beginning to unravel slightly. 
 There is a bit problem brewing for Tom, the imminent release of his overbearing and unrepentant Ponzi-schemer father from prison. He's freaked, and decides to keep that to himself. It causes a strain that Reese immediately senses. Tom's ringer is often off, and he's begging off from their usual social outings. Reese has a very firm hand, and soft mouth, when it comes to opening Tom's vault, but it's pretty unfair that Reese has to do all the heavy lifting. When accounting irregularities begin popping up at his work, Tom's putting in extra hours to clear any suspicion that might be directed at himself, being the son of a financial crook. 
 Meanwhile, Reese's job is getting way more involved and intense as he's called in to some creative meetings with the Marketing director, a suave Brit man named Niall. Niall thinks Reese's ideas are great, and really admires his tenacity. As their work relationship grows, it becomes clear that Niall has designs on Reese, and not in a creepy way. 
 With Tom virtually ignoring him, it's hard for Reese to confide the way his professional life is shifting, but Tom gets the hint at Reece's company Christmas party, and he's kicking himself for turning down all Reese's invites to hang out with his work colleagues. 
 This is really a great established relationship read. Adult life is messy. There will always be people who wish to insert themselves into the personal relationships of others. Niall isn't malicious, he's ignorant of Reese's partnership. That said, there's a chemistry there, one that's lacking with absentee-brooding Tom. I will assure readers that this book is all about the HEA. I hadn't realized there was a Christmas theme here, but it comes across loud and clear. Tom reverted to his same self-isolation tactics as in OFF CAMPUS, and Reese took care of him now, as he did back then. There are a lot of steamy scenes in REAL WORLD. Because Tom is such a poor talker, he and Reese spend a LOT of time in sexytimes. Hooray for that! I was emotionally invested the entire time, and it really got to me when Tom didn't trust Reese enough to confide. His grand gestures in the end, however, were a great sign that he'd turned that corner.

 Jason is a Hollywood-has-been, a former child star who's become a B-list actor in slasher flicks, and he's plain tired of it. The tabloids have been hounding him for years, capturing and exaggerating every foible of his life, so Jason's moved out to rural Idaho to escape and regroup. He's got one close friend (with benefits) Dylan, who Jason has secretly loved for the better part of ten years. Dylan's bisexual, and not the monogamous type. He gives Jason what he can, which is never enough. 
 While moving in, Jason observes a stranger in his guest house. Believing it's paparazzi, Jason calls the local sheriff, but no one is found. It is then that Jason realizes that he is the only person who can see the man looking back at him through the guest house window. A ghost then? 
 Not so much. 
 Ben, as Jason soon learns, was trapped in a snow globe by his sister, to avoid enlistment into the Confederate Army. Yup. Ben is 170 years old, and has spent 150 years trapped in the barren landscape of the scene of the globe. Jason is the first person he has spoken to since the Union deserter stole him from his family home in Tennessee. 
 This is a paranormal romance, and one must make some leaps of faith to love this story, but only int he scientific realm. The emotional landscape is so richly textured,and the realities of Ben and Jason's growing affection are well-sorted by the author. Over the course of two months, Jason and Ben become very close indeed, and it leads to big trouble. 
 Dylan is afraid that Jason's losing his mind, and at times Jason agrees. One thing is for certain,Jason cannot imagine his life without Ben--and he doesn't want to. Experimenting with their boundaries leads to health problems for Jason, however. 
 I will admit to sensing the exact path this story was going to take, and that's totally fine because the journey was excellent. I didn't want to miss a step, walking beside Ben and Jason on their snowy treks or movie theater escapades or dreamscapes. These are two guys who needed real love, true acceptance, and they gave and gave and gave of themselves--to each other. Jason could have easily thrown Dylan off his suspicions by simply giving in to his normal relations with Dylan, but once he had developed intimacy with Ben, he couldn't accept Dylan's less-than-ardent advances. 
 Throughout the book I has a sense of expectation, for both disaster and happiness, and both were satisfied. The climax is a bit of a thriller, and the epilogue made me chuckle. I wanted a little bit more sexytimes, but, hey, the book has tons of emotional moments, so my heart soared and plummeted along with Jason's. I wished I had the chance to know Ben's sister Sarah. She seems like a fantastic gal. 
 In all, this is a most enjoyable paranormal read, with a great small cast and a love that defied all boundaries. I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley.",Tue Dec 01 08:24:34 -0800 2015,Tue Dec 01 08:51:47 -0800 2015,Tue Dec 01 09:02:50 -0800 2015,,3,0

She developed strong friendships and an even stronger bond with her father in the last 8 years. Unfortunately, Parker's father died three months ago and her aunt's family has moved across the country to live in her home, with her. Parker's developed some tough rules, meant to protect her heart, and also her mind-especially after Scott-her former best friend and maybe first love, crushed her back in eighth grade. 
 It's junior year and Scott has returned to Parker's high school. Their small town has combined two schools into one, actually, which means there are lots of new people and new situations for Parker to encounter. She meets a new ""buddy"" Molly, a chaperone who helps her navigate the school day. Parker and Molly strike it off, mostly because Molly's willing to be honest with Parker-whose default setting is brutal honesty. Parker wants to be treated like a regular kid, and she strives for this. It's what draws her to Jason, a decent guy who treats her decently. 
 While Parker's life is filled with people, she's still rather solitary. She spends a lot of time with her young cousin, Petey, and none at all with her other cousin, Sheila, despite them being the same age and being in school together. All the school politics are on display, and despite a spark between Parker and Jason, it's clear that Scott is still in the picture, too. Always on the fringes, Scott's filling in the gaps he knows were left behind with Parker's father died. 
 I really admired Parker. She's brash, with the understanding that it's not easy being disabled, and it's even worse to be considered 'less than' because of her disability. She makes new and unlikely friends, and tries even more unlikely feats, including running. It's refreshing to see how she navigates the world around her, and the high school foibles-including first dates and kisses. For all her outward strength, she's a deeply thinking girl, and willing to own up to her mistakes-when she's able to confront them. Her unflinching honesty can be abrasive, but she applies that to herself just as much as to others. 
 In a litscape filled with ordinary people, Parker shines in her extraordinary will to be as normal as possible. This is a story that doesn't have a sweeping grand gesture, more like a series of realizations that don't lead to reconciliations. Which was perfectly acceptable. As Scott and Parker recognize: they are not their 8th grade selves anymore, and what they had then is very different from what they have now. There is 2+ years of animosity and betrayal to overcome, and it's not flipping a switch to turn back time and reconnect. That was a striking moment for both Parker, and the reader. 
 So many times YA stories are too convenient, with some mid-level conflict that is easily resolved. Nothing in this book is convenient or contrived. Parker's cousin Sheila isn't kind. Parker's friends are a mixture of races, genders and sexualities with really different personalities. Parker's aunt is rigid and easily offended-not able to cope with Parker's need for autonomy. So, it's all a big trial for Parker, to cobble all this scrip-scrap bits of life together into a patchwork quilt of people to support and love her. Including Scott.

 Will and Patrick are still masquerading as a loving, happily married couple in Healing, South Dakota. They met in Vegas just prior to Thanksgiving, and got drunk and married in that order. because Will's inheritance, the Molinari Trust, is mafia money that will be forfeit if he and Patrick are divorced, they are making a go of it until they can figure a way out. They cohabitate the honeymoon suite in the Tallgrass Hotel, and things are awkward. The room only has a king sized bed, and Will insists on sleeping on the sofa, because he's still in love with his ex, an emotionally abusive SOB named Ryan. Also, Will doesn't want to just have sex with Patrick, his husband, he wants it to mean something. Patrick is a socially awkward, self-important neurosurgeon who is a survivor of child abuse. He's a prickly one, to be sure. 
 This book, DO THE HOLIDAYS, spans the time between Thanksgiving and New Years. Patrick meets Will's younger step-siblings who are all pleasant and he develops a rapport with them over Legos and deep conversations. He is still shunned/baited by Will's mother who thinks Will should get back together with Ryan (which clearly demonstrates what a poor parent she is). Patrick puts up with it, barely. 
 In the previous episode Patrick began to observe his feelings for Will change from lust into deep appreciation (and lust!) and that change has progressed into affection. It's a unique feeling for him, and he's still not willing to share it verbally. He is the rock that Will needs, however, especially when Ryan stomps all over Will for the millionth time. Also, he's definitely down for some Will-lovin' and has an increasingly hard time being near Will without expressing himself physically. The sexual tension is high! 
 Will doesn't want to want Patrick, but he's not immune to the hints of affection he senses from his unwilling husband. Through is conversations with Patrick, and others, he's seeing Ryan in a whole new, and unflattering, light. We get the first hint of this on Christmas, and it's only stronger on New Years. I loved how Will and Patrick develop their relationship in this episode. They are nervous and scared, but clearly attracted and also becoming quite close. Patrick jokes that Will is his best friend, but it's not really a joke after all. They have quiet moments of intense bonding, and finally consummate their relationship when they are both sober enough to enjoy--and remember!--it. 
 So, YAY for sexytimes happening on the page! I'm so happy these guys are getting closer and building a life together.

 Trevor is a successful artist in the end stage of renal disease. He's been on dialysis for the past seven years in the hopes of finding a suitable donor, but his kidney function is failing and he probably has less than a year to live, even with dialysis. He's 39 and facing his mortality. It's creeping up on what will likely be his last Christmas with his large and loving family, but his flight is cancelled when a blizzard grinds all transportation around Denver to a halt. 
 Marc is a driven attorney, hell-bent on making partner at 38. He's sacrificed his entire adult life to be the kind of son his homophobic mother would be proud of, only to note that he has no life except work. Stranded in the white out, he makes his way to a nearby hotel and books a room for the night. Seeing Trevor in the cafe, Marc is immediately attracted. His invitation to sit and join him becomes a long conversation and a further invite to share his room once Trevor confesses that he was unable to get a room due to a sell-out. 
 Neither man is really open to more than one night's solace, despite their incendiary passion. Trevor hasn't had a partner for years, and he's had even less of a libido for most of that time. Something about Marc stirs him, however. In the cold light of day neither Marc nor Trevor can admit they have more than lust boiling along, even if it's true. That said, Trevor doesn't want to reveal his illness and Marc knows a relationship will detract from his workaholic ways. Still, Marc can't abide with Trevor spending his Christmas Eve, and maybe longer, on a couch in the hotel's lobby. He invites Trevor to his beautiful and barren home outside Boulder. 
 Trevor's reluctant to let any connection build between himself and Marc, but it happen anyway. They spend a fantastic Christmas together, Trevor coming clean about his illness and prognosis when Marc presses him for more than their three day fling when he returns from visiting his family. It is bittersweet and melancholy and heart-wrenching and wonderful that these two lonely souls find a spark in such dire times. 
 I fully enjoyed the resolution to this one, which, I will state firmly, was an HEA. Marc's selfless offering of himself helped him to realize all that he had to offer others, and allowed him to break free of his self-loathing. I really liked how he engaged himself with his colleagues and found the best way to handle his very sad situation. Trevor is a man who has resolved himself on imminent death. He's afraid to hope one more, probably last, time. And it shows. He does find the courage to accept Marc's lifeline, however, and it proves the adage that life is always darkest before the dawn. 
 I just plain loved this. It's a well-told strangers-to-lovers story that doesn't ooze sap, despite the medical realities of the plot. The Christmas aspect was balanced, with high and low points--love, loss, isolation, acceptance. I will admit to shedding a tear, or three. As a person with an even rarer blood type than Trevor, I sympathized with his plight. (I may B- but I will always be positive!) There aren't too many sexytimes, but they are all about the feels. Highly recommend!

 This book is set in the fantastical realm of Cloudburst Falls, West Virginia in a contemporary time period with the addition of magic, mobs and mayhem. Okay, so really it's only magic that's a game changer. In this bookscape, there are people who possess magical Talents, like super speed, strengths, divination etc. There are also magical creatures--which are highly concentrated in the mountainous area of Clouburst Falls, or so says the tourism board. Still, lochnesses, tree trolls and copper crushers are part of the fauna, and one must know how to deal with these creatures in order to get on. 
 Lila Merriweather is not who she claims to be, and there are few who know the secret of her identity. She was born Lila Sterling, child of Serena Sterling, a powerful woman who fled Cloudburst Falls after Lila's father was murdered by his benefactor, Victor Draconi--head of the Draconi Family and the same dude who later murdered Serena, stealing her magical Talents. 
 Lila wants to avenge her parents, but she's only 17 and still honing her magic, plus she knows it would be a suicide mission to take out the head of the most powerful Family in Cloudburst Falls. Instead, she's the personal bodyguard of Devon Sinclair--son of Claudia Sinclair and second-in-command of the Sinclair Family. Lila recently saved Devon from certain death and is just getting used to her new position in the Family, as she's been living on her own and stealing for a living since her mother's murder four years ago. Also, she's totally gaga for Devon, and he for her, but she holds off on making anything physical because she has lost too many people close to her to let Devon get in close. 
 This book is the set-up before the major clash between the Sinclair and Draconi families. We learn, intimately, just how underhanded the Draconis can be--and how ruthless some of these people in this world are. 
 The set-up is a tournament, which is meant to showcase all the Talents of the Families to themselves and the tourists. It's a major attraction and has been won by Deah Draconi for the past two years. Deah's not the biggest or strongest, but her mimic magic is a distinct edge. Devon and Lila are part of the competition this year, as is Katia Volkov--an outsider who comes down from New York to compete. She lost to Deah the past two years and is angling to win it all. 
 I really liked the bit of mystery that was woven into the story. Lila and Devon notice that the magical monsters are moving around, coming out from their normal habitats into areas that are more highly populated. This seems to be a defensive move because they also find many carcasses strewn about the woods, with suspicious markings and clearly malicious stab wounds. I had the culprit and motive pinpointed early on, but that didn't mean I wasn't happy with the reveal. Also, it made for some good suspense. 
 Lila has a lot to learn about the Family life, but she embraces the affection and support given so freely by the Sinclairs. Her mother and Claudia had been best friends in their girlhood, and Claudia is happy to have Lila with her. Of course, there are lots of secrets about Lila's mother, and who best to relate them than Serena's sister--not that Lila knew she had an aunt. Or a cousin, one who is poised to become her enemy and her ally. That twist was really excellent, and also sets up the next book stunningly. 
 Lila is a dark horse to win the tournament, but she performs exceedingly well, and it's hers to lose. I won't reveal any of that, but the depth of empathy Lila exhibits in the course of competition made her truly likable as a character. I liked that the love story between Lila and Devon is a side issue, one that Lila continues to set to the side, because her duty lies elsewhere. She has the right mindset, and I was glad that she behaved like a woman with a brain, and also a heart. I'm looking forward the next book.

For readers who do not like cliffhangers, the series ends here. (Well, there could always be another adventure, but there are no unresolved plot questions.) 
 If you have NOT read BOOK OF IVY, some spoilers below. 
 When last we left off: 
 1. The world is in ruins due to war 50 years ago and collectives have endured these lean times. 
 2. Westfall is a town divided. One side is wealthy the other, not. At age 16 children from one side of the town are married to spouses from the other side, to prevent rebellion and foster amity. 
 3. Ivy Westfall's family founded Westfall, but the Lattimer family stole the power and maintains the government. Ivy has grown up in the bad side of Westfall, and has been diligently trained to hate the Lattimers. Her elder sister, Callie, was supposed to be married to Bishop Lattimer, son of President Lattimer, two years ago, but he refused. Bishop wanted Ivy. 
 4. Ivy's father and sister want Ivy to murder Bishop. 
 5. Ivy falls for Bishop. 
 6. Ivy refuses to kill Bishop. 
 7. Ivy is (view spoiler)[accused and sentenced for attempted murder anyway and (hide spoiler)]put outside of the barrier fence that protects Westfall's territory and water supply. This is, essentially, a death sentence. 
 In Ivy's case, she a little to no chance of surviving, but she manages to fend off two specific dangers, acquires a canteen and walks until she collapses. She is rescued by Caleb and Ash (Ashley) who tend her wounds and bring her into their settlement. They do not trust her, but she's identified as Ivy Westfall, and there are enough refugees of Westfall around to ensure Ivy a welcome. She is afraid they will learn that she married, and (gasp!) loved Bishop Lattimer, as these people are outside the fence due to Bishop's father's ""justice"". BTW some of them were put out for just cause, but many others were set out because they refused to accept their arranged marriages; they think Ivy was set out for this very reason and are sympathetic. 
 During the weeks, Ivy, Ash and Caleb become friends. Caleb knows that Ivy is not telling the truth, but he cannot prove it. In the meantime, Ivy proves herself to be a quick learner and a hard worker. She gains other friendships, and feels a part of a community as she never did in Westfall--either side. Naturally, this all falls apart when BIshop arrives in the camp. 
 There is animosity, but a steady growth of respect as Bishop sets out to prove he is ""not his father's son"" (figuratively, peeps). Ivy can't bear to be parted from Bishop again, but she also can't get close to him, fearing that she'll lose him all over again in this even harsher world than Westfall. I applaud Bishop's patience, because I wanted to hit Ivy in the face for all her tentativeness. Live in the NOW, Ivy! LOL. 
 Anywho, Caleb and Ash find that Bishop is awesome, and Bishop gets Ivy to do what she never has done: tell the truth, of herself and her feelings. It builds a strong bond that is tested when Ivy learns that Westfall's in disarray and her family is at extreme risk. 
 Ivy feels the need to make as much right as she can, and is disgruntled with Bishop, Ash, and Caleb who decide to assist. This seemed like a truly madcap enterprise, and I cannot say that I would have done what Ivy did, but I believe that Ivy did what she needed to do. (Even if I think it was utter foolishness!) That girl does love with her whole heart, even if she is hesitant to reveal it... 
 The end is a naturally gruesome affair, though it was a better situation than I did predict. I was satisfied in the reading. I still like Ivy, and adore Bishop and hope that this future world nevah-evah comes to pass. 
 Funny thing, Ivy and Bishop's marriage was annulled when she was put outside the fence. It struck me that Bishop never discarded the ring, nor did he ever plan to let Ivy go. His steadfast love was fairy tale in origin, and it made me (and Ivy) swoony. He never tries to dissuade her from her plans, and always seeks her counsel in decisions. He's an excellent partner, a rock really, who only wants to love Ivy as she is, whoever she is. That was heart-warming. They do consummate their love, but it's all off the page.

 Will Patterson is a diabetic and a recovering alcoholic with a lousy (new) ex. He's also the eldest son of Tony Molinari, incarcerated head of a mobster family. Will's been raised outside of that syndicate realm in tiny Healing, South Dakota, with his mother, step-siblings and paternal Nonna but he's in possession of the Molinari trust as the eldest grandchild. He's using the millions of blood money to fund Good Works, a charitable foundation that provides free and discounted medical care all over the world. He's just financed the expansion of the Healing Hospital, and is at a medical conference in Las Vegas to recruit neurologists and Neurosurgeons to the hospital when he gets a call from Ryan, his on-again/off-again boyfriend of the past 6 years. Ryan lets Will know, via telephone, that they are through. For good. 
 We learn all of this when Will wakes up from a killer bender, naked, in a strange hotel room, and married to a man he doesn't remember. As it all comes back into focus, Will is horrified by his actions. He'd been sober a number of years, and he adores Ryan, and he stands to lose all the monies in the Molinari trust if he divorces the now-surly and soon to be unemployed Dr. Patrick McCloud. 
 Patrick is a sexy, demanding Neurosurgeon. He's the epitome of a prima donna surgeon and his ego and big mouth make him zero friends. While freaking out over his newly-married state he supremely pisses off his chief of staff, and is summarily dismissed. 
 Will convinces Patrick to visit Healing, and help him sort out the possibility of getting the trust amended to allow for a divorce without all the money being given back to the mob. 
 This predicament is rife with issues, and Will and Patrick are angry with themselves and each other for a good deal of the book. I liked Will, as he's easily likable. Patrick's a prickly one. I'm reserving my thoughts on him for the moment, on account of they aren't especially flattering, and I suspect he's going to have an epiphany in the very near future. He does show elements of compassion, especially when helping manage Will's diabetes. 
 Throughout I was holding out hope for some actual tenderness to pop up between Will and Patrick, but it's too soon, I think. This episode was truly on the first 36 hours in the aftermath of waking in their debacle> They are both hungover and freaked the heck out. There are some clear elements of Molinari menace in the background, and it's likely that this will become more prominent in the next episode. Also, I think Patrick's cockiness is going to get soundly trimmed soon--likely due to having fewer career options than he suspects. 
 I'm intrigued to read on, and hoping there will be some romantic elements in the near future.",Mon Oct 26 07:45:25 -0700 2015,Thu Oct 29 20:01:09 -0700 2015,Sun Oct 25 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,4,0

 I really enjoyed this contemporary M/M romance, which is also a GFY story. 
 Jay Hill is the talk of his Mississippi town. He's newly divorced from his high school sweetheart, Bethany, and returned to his hometown to raise his two kids (16 y/o son and 12 y/o daughter) near their maternal grandparents. Jay and Bethany have an amicable divorce; she's realizing her career dreams by going back to college in Atlanta, and he's content to live a slower-paced life as a manager at a local lumber plant. People there don't understand how Jay and Bethany split, however, and his in-laws aren't pleased that the kids aren't being raised in a church home. And, he's tired of the churchy women he keeps getting introduced to. Scandalous! 
 Landon Petty has been working two jobs for his father's lumber business, despite his degree in History and aspirations to teach. He's so relieved that Jay is hired to take some of the load off his shoulders, but he's not happy to find his former babysitter so god-awful attractive. Landon's gay and out to his parents, but he's very circumspect and quiet in his hometown. He takes himself three hours away for anonymous hook-ups, and it's tiring. 
 As Jay spends more time alone, when his kids go to his in-law's for a weekend visit, he has trouble in his empty house. So, he invites Landon out to watch a football game at a local bar. They hit it off, and it's a fast friendship, one Jay and Landon really cherish. 
 Landon keeps his attraction so quiet, but it's not long before Jay starts to see Landon in a strange (for him) new light. He enjoys their companionship, and is frightened and confused as his friendly feelings begin to turn into attraction. 
 What I really liked about this story is the long development of the friendship and eventual breach into sex. That worked, as both men are fairly lonesome, and had developed a steady friendship. Jay is alerted to Landon's sexuality by a nasty busybody, and it flips a switch for him. Experimenting with gay porn opens new chambers in Jay's brain, unlocking memories of his childhood close friendships with boys. I really thought Jay's introspection was honest. And, I appreciated that he sought help sorting out his feelings, and was honest about it with Landon. Their candor was refreshing. 
 Landon was a rock, even when he wanted to crumble. He said ""no pressure"" regarding coming out, and he meant it. And he lived it. He thrilled to every kiss or touch, and yet he was willing to walk if Jay couldn't handle it. 
 While I was angry regarding Bethany's initial reaction to Jay and Landon, I think she redeemed herself about 90% after sleeping on it. Jay was a far stronger character in the end, than the beginning. His kids were excellently written. Seriously, I wanted to kiss Clint for being an excellent big brother and the sounding board both his parents needed. 
 There are some fantastic sexytimes, and a beautiful, realistic relationship between two admirable, ordinary men. Expect some editing issues regarding continuity in the plot. Those mostly get smoothed over by the second half.",Fri Oct 16 07:19:40 -0700 2015,Fri Oct 16 07:44:08 -0700 2015,Thu Oct 15 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,10,0

 Ria is a Bollywood star, with a reputation as an Ice Princess. She has no trysts, and only a few skeletons--a casting couch issue and her clinically insane mother(view spoiler)[ who beat her near to death as a child and killed her father after setting their home on fire (hide spoiler)]. The press hounds her and catches her in a compromising position on her balcony--but her manager has it handled...for now. 
 In the meantime Ria's cousin Nikhal is getting married and she's being summoned back the the only real home she ever knew: her aunt and uncle's house in suburban Chicago. Problem? Nik's other cousin, Vikram, will surely be there. And Ria and Vik had a bold love affair ten years ago that ended REALLY REALLY badly. Ria hurt Vik super, duper bad (it was for his own good!!!) and he's not likely to let that go. 
 First, and foremost, I loved the Indian cultural aspects--from tumultuous Mumbai to the Chicagoland settings. The relationships were delightfully depicted. All the auntie's and uncle's weighing in on the proceedings. All the families of their community being so close-knit is an accurate representation of first-gen immigrants here in Chicagotown. I've had many experiences with the Indian community (even dated a young Indian man as a girl) and they are a lively and loving group. Be prepared to lose track of the accessory characters...there are many and they all have actual names and nicknames. 
 Second, I loved how loving this part of Ria's family is. Everyone embraces everyone else with open arms. Nik's fiance is Chinese, but she is so captivated by Nik's family that she plans a proper Hindu wedding. Ria's expertise (having been a bride in about 20 Bollywood films) is indispensable and welcomed. 
 It's not all sunshine and samosas, however. Vik's absolutely furious with Ria, still, after ten years. He lost his youthful heart to her, and it set his whole life off course, in his parents' opinions. 
 Anywho, Ria's a big celebrity in the Chicago Indian community, and she's aloof but gracious, as always. Inside, she's a wreck. She's still gone over Vik, who's a Class A Jackass to her and his current girlfriend. I get that he's had it rough, but I half expected him to demand 
 sati 
 over the pyre of his broken heart. He's ice-cold, then luke warm, then cold, then burning hot, and it's a lot to take in. Especially for Ria who's not sure she's altogether there, mentally. Remember, her mom's crazytown, and everyone said she was normal until she gave birth. And the same was said about her maternal grandmother. Ria ""comes from insanity"" so she can never be a true partner to anyone, least of all her beloved Vik. 
 I think the ending was spectacular. And I was so glad that there was some happiness for Ria, and for Vik (though this was less of a priority for me). By the end I didn't dislike Vik anymore, and I really, really liked Ria. I know she's supposed to be hesitant, and second-guessing due to her fears of insanity, but it got to be a little much. She clearly drove herself to obsessive-compulsive behaviors in her contemplation of her mental health. Which, was NOT GOOD. 
 That said, I loved the culture, I loved the family, and I liked the romance, which heated up quite nicely. I wanted more likable main characters, but I got human ones with reasonable frailties instead, and that's pretty okay, too.

She's getting her fortune told at a Halloween carnival when the gnarled gypsy tosses her at the Grim Reaper. Gideon can't undo the damage now that he's collected RJ's soul--even if it's a mistake. She has no choice but to ascend to the Lobby with him. There, she watches as group after group of souls called to Judgement. She encounters a fellow soul unwilling to advance, Sandy, who's awaiting her beloved James to arrive. Throughout, RJ is professing her frustration over being miscollected--and being a bit of a diva over it. Naturally, as RJ is a diva over everything. 
 She raises, in this case, holy hell, and it leads to an unprecedented Tribunal of angels who must decide if RJ's worth the trouble of unraveling time to re-insert her into her timeline. And, honestly, the verdict is no. She's been a nasty, mean, lying, conniving wretch of a girl--all in the pursuit of popularity. Her two Guardian angels help to plead her case, that she's young a redeemable, but it is Death Himself who arranges a series of tests--to verify if RJ would make the right choices given the chance. She has spirit guides from her own life (ala A Christmas Carol) leading her back to three key times when RJ departed from a good path. 
 RJ is quite a character. She is unashamedly self-centered and made many, many wrong choices with her life, but she is adamant that she'll do better. And, in many ways she does. The bulk of the book is her arguing her case to all and sundry, begging to be heard. And, even when she is heard, those in charge will likely not do as she wishes. Why should they, after all? She is not a worthy soul, in their opinion. And, they're right. But this tough girl makes even her Grams proud as she meets and exceeds Death Himself's challenges. 
 I will admit to being frustrated by the ending. I wanted so much for RJ to live the life I pictured for her, and sadly it's not the case. That said, this was a fantastic redemption tale with a very human, and believable, main character. Her journey was quite a wild ride, and how she made amends was thoroughly believable. For all the Heaven and Hell parts of this book, it's not preachy and it's not churchy. Again, like A Christmas Carol, RJ must ponder the parts of her life that went wrong. She has to overcome her Mean Girls training and fight for the right to live a better life than the one she was collected from. I adored how the angels were honest. Brutally honest. RJ is little more than a pest, in their view. Turning back time is a huge undertaking--and opens the gates for other souls to complain that their time should not have been up.

When this book opens, Cael and Ash are still healing from wounds sustained in the previous story. That said, they are finally developing the bonds that Cael has long hoped to build. Sure, they had been the closest of friends, and definitely affectionate, but it had never gone past the occasional tender kiss, or cuddling. Cael wants more, and Ash wants more, but Ash has a long history of self-loathing. 
 As a child, Ash had feelings for another boy, and a series of tragic incidences chased him far from his love and all the people he held dear. He grew up in a testing facility for cast off Therians, alongside Sloane Brodie. Ash survived the emotional and physical testing to later join THIRDS as one of the first agents in the program. He's kept his heart held tight, but now he's thinking there's one person who would keep it safe: Cael. 
 This is a definite hurt/comfort story, with both Ash and Cael working toward the kind of relationship they have always desired. In the background we have another diabolical plot hatching-one which had first come to light in BLOOD AND THUNDER but the full extent is only now being revealed. Someone has been developing a drug to control Therians in their animal form-creating drones with ultimate killing capability and no consciousness or conscience to stop them. Ash and Sloane are among the targeted, due to their history as Therian test subjects. It's a dangerous and covert business, getting control of the drug before it's used, and might put Cael in specific danger, as well. 
 I really enjoyed the careful relationship building. Just because Ash and Cael have been close for several years, Ash is stunned to learn of Cael's tragic pre-THIRDS history. Ash knows he needs to tread carefully, but it's not that long before he recognizes that he can't be the man Cael needs without taking chances on love. There's a lot of vulnerability here, and super sweet steps toward coupledom. I think THIRDS fans will be well-satisfied.",Thu Sep 24 07:49:29 -0700 2015,Thu Sep 24 07:52:02 -0700 2015,Mon Sep 21 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,1,0

 This is a YA dystopian story of survival, in a way--excepting the fact that we know from the start that the main character, Greta, will die. Yep. Greta Gustafson Stuart Duchess of Halifax and Crown Princess of the Pan Polar Confederacy, next-in-line for the throne, will die. 
 Here's how: 
 She is a hostage, sheltered and educated in one of Preceptures for royal hostages. This is Earth, 400 years into the future. Earth ruled by alliances that one hadn't dreamed possible, but that's what happens when the ice caps melt, there's widespread famine, and wars to end all wars have ravaged the globe enough to hand the control of the orbiting weapons systems over to AI in order to save humanity. 
 Talis, specifically, was the UN AI in charge of conflict abatement. And he stopped the wars. 
 I saw the plague pits, I saw the starving armies, and eventually I... 
 Well, it was my job, wasn't it? I saved you. 
 I started by blowing up cities. 
 By city number seven--Fresno, because no one's gonna miss that--I had everyone's attention. I told them to stop shooting each other. And they did. 
 But of course it couldn't be that easy. 
 The general terror led to a global stand down, and now Talis enforces peace by ""making it personal""--essentially keeping a Child from each territorial ruler as a hostage. This Child of Peace will be killed if that ruler goes to war. Simple, brilliant, and effective. Despite marginal resources on a global scale, there have been modest amounts of incursion, and fewer wars. 
 Greta is a Child of Peace, raised in the 4th Precepture since age 5. She regularly visits home to her mother--like all Children of Peace--so as to reinforce the family bond, but her actual home has been on a self-sustaining farm in what was once Saskatchewan. Now 16 she has grown up around other Children of Peace, her cellmate Xie, who is considered to be descended from a Goddess in her homeland, and Atta whose people consider him a prophet, among others. They work hard raising goats for milk and cheese, fruit and vegetables and grains and honey--all the foodstuffs they require, and they learn about war, and peace and philosophy. Greta is an excellent student, but Greta's time is coming close. She knows because her land has water (Lake Ontario) and the people to the south, the new Cumberland Alliance, cannot survive on the dregs of Lake Erie. When a Child arrives from their current War Secretary, Elian, Greta recognizes that her life is likely numbered in months, or even weeks. 
 Elian is like no other Child of Peace. He was raised in his home, with his parents. His Grandmother rules the Cumberland Alliance. He knows there will be war, and he knows he's been sent to die, and he will not go quietly. 
 The Precepture is guarded by electronic monitors that use electric shock to keep the peace. As Elian soon discovers, he will be tortured until he is compliant. Greta and her comrades have seen nothing of resistance in their years there. Being raised from early childhood they learned to comply, to code their speech so that it didn't sound insubordinate or revolutionary, but Elian has no scruples, and his torture breaks something open in Greta. She was resigned to death, but perhaps it doesn't need to be something she accepts. 
 I was caught in the state of constant readiness, alongside Greta. Most of her comrades are safe from the threat of death, by virtue of having no encroaching enemies, or too much power in their region. Greta and Elian should be enemies, but she cannot hate him. It is not his fault their people are at the brink of war. This is where the usual dynamic goes awry. People will expect Greta to fall for the bad-boy rebel Elian, and she does, but not the usual way. 
 He did not seem happy about it. ""I don't get it. From the day they dragged me here, I was going to die--we were both going to die--and you were okay with that."" 
 ""I was wrong."" 
 There are a whole lot of fantastic, unprecedented changes in store for the Children of Peace, not least of which is meeting a hostile enemy and the savior of the human race. 
 At no point does Greta become a soppy mess of a lovesick girl. She does change and affection comes, but it is unexpected and bittersweet. 
 ""You don't love me."" 
 ""Oh, Elian."" It was not that simple. Not nearly. ""I--I'm sixteen years old. And I've been asleep my whole life."" 
 ""You woke me up, Elian Palnik."" 
 I found the almost Stockholm syndrome scenario of Greta's world to be intriguing. She knew that her mother could not/would not save her. She was resigned to sacrifice, and yet, she made choices that enabled her a modicum of freedom, in a way. A death of her choosing. Greta dies, but she also lives on--and not in a martyred memory. She is wise and she is capable--the unelected leader of the Children of Peace in her Precepture. She reaches out for help, and she sways a god. In her cool and calculating mind she finds a middle passage that saves hundreds of thousands, and, in particular, the one she promised to save. 
 There is a love story here, but it is not between Greta and Elian. He is boy she hardly knows. No, Greta finds love with the people she has leaned on throughout her childhood. That love she never allowed herself to experience, fearing she would lose it becomes a purpose in her final hours. 
 If I was going to put my life down--as Wilma had--then I wanted to mourn it. I wanted to regret it, and fiercely. Maybe the grey room would kill me, and maybe not, but one way or another it would transform me, and this life would be done. I wanted to be alive before that happened. I wanted to be alive before I died, and I wanted death to terrify me, not slip in like a long expected guest. 
 As for the book, there were parts I wanted to move faster, that then became important later. Those deft touches, and full-circling, brought my enjoyment back when it began to falter. There was a sharpness to the narration, a gallows humor, that kept the prose light. I did not weep for Greta. I did admire her, and I expect that her sacrifice will bring change to her world. And that's the best compliment I can give to a protagonist.",Tue Sep 22 12:23:32 -0700 2015,Tue Sep 22 13:56:52 -0700 2015,Tue Sep 22 16:56:44 -0700 2015,,2,0

 When I found this book on Joyfully Jay's Favorite Coming Out Stories list, I jumped at the chance to review this for the Reading Challenge. I've read a few ZA Maxfield books in the past, and have enjoyed them, so the re-release of Crossing Borders piqued my interest. As I didn't read the original, I can't comment on the extent of revision or editing, but I will tell you that the book in current form is spectacular. 
 Tristan is a 19-year-old, sexually-confused college student. He's been sexually active with girls for several years, but he's thinking that he is, perhaps, gay. He doesn't seem to get that turned on with girls, and he's had lots of gay fantasies. So, Tristan's out to trap a guy, and find out for sure. He gathers up a bunch of gay literature and plants himself in the cafe of a Borders Books (back when they existed!! *sigh*) in plain view of the customers, one of whom happens to be off-duty Officer Michael Truax, the very same cop who ticketed Tristan years ago for skateboarding without a helmet. 
 challenge monthTristan is not happy that ""Officer Helmet"" is lingering in the cafe, and he's even less happy with the text commentary the good cop offers on the men who do attempt to pick Tristan up. When Tristan's fishing expedition is a bust, Michael pushes Tristan to have lunch together, and that's when the Tristan gets the bombshell: Officer Helmet just picked him up. 
 The thing is, Michael is really a good looking man. He's 26 with a gorgeously restored Craftsman home, and Michael's clearly gay. And willing to help Tristan become less sexually confused. I absolutely melted along with these two as they spend an afternoon and night talking and working out the sexy. Tristan is a man-boy, old enough, but so naive and so appealing to Michael, who admits he's harbored an almost-creepy attraction for ""Sparky""--the nickname Michael gave to Tristan the first time they met. 
 As the book unfolds, Tristan must come to terms with his sexuality. He does so with his family and friends, being the bold kid he always has been, but honestly he's so tender. Being in his POV as he makes himself vulnerable is fantastic. Tristan has a lot of abandonment issues. He father died of a brain aneurysm and he's living at home instead of going away to college so that he can be a role model to his younger sister and brothers, and help his mother with their care. He's an admirable, stand-up guy, despite being a self-admitted adrenaline junkie and a tad reckless. Being with Michael is a little reckless, for Tristan, because Michael's a young cop who has the worst detail and works nights often. Fear for Michael's safety definitely becomes an issue for Tristan. 
 I don't want to reveal too many of the plot points here, but I want to remind readers that the book was written in 2007, published originally shortly thereafter, and for the characters in the story gay marriage is being banned nationwide, being out and proud as a cop is dangerous, and gay partners have no rights in the hospital. For goodness sake, BORDERS was a popular bookstore all those years ago! While times change, and laws change, and attitudes change, the feelings in Crossing Borders are timeless. Tristan's family is flabbergasted with his news, and it takes them a bit to warm up to Michael. Michael's family, friends, and work colleagues are suspicious of the ""boy"" who's hanging around. They have problems, and issues, and reality. It's not easy being together. But nothing worth fighting for ever is, right? 
 I can easily see why this made Jay's list of favorite coming out stories. Tristan is engaging and brilliant as a main character. He's cocky and self-assured, but smart enough to realize that he doesn't know it all. When presented with challenges, he rises to the occasion time and again. The story is well-told and approachable, with details that enrich, not distract. Michael is a protective man, seeing the dangers on the street on a daily basis. He's had a rough time of his own, emotionally, and never wants to see anyone suffer. For all his witty banter, his heart is bigger than Texas, I think. I adored how Michael keeps his restored home free of many of the modern conveniences--like cable TV and internet--which are out of period with the house and it's furnishings. It really struck me how Tristan's deep appreciation for architecture allowed him to connect with Michael's ""old soul"" ways. Their conflicts pulled me in; from overprotective misunderstandings to big ole abandonment problems, I wanted to see Michael and Tristan come out stronger on the other side. Also, hoo-boy, a break for a cold shower won't come amiss. This book is hot and heart combined. Expect a rough road to the HEA, and some tear-jerking moments. Best advice: plan for an immediate re-read.",Mon Sep 21 16:57:37 -0700 2015,Mon Sep 21 17:07:18 -0700 2015,Sun Aug 09 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,3,0

 Anthony, Viscount Rawling, has known since he was young that he preferred men--and mostly, that he preferred Gabriel Tilden, elder brother of his childhood friend Pearce, above all other men. They shared one kiss seven years ago, while Anthony stayed at the Tilden's over a summer party, and Gabriel promptly married a woman. Now, Anthony has the occasion to see the recently widowed Gabriel as he escorts his sister around London. 
 Gabriel has shameful lust in his heart and mind. He knows he's foul, and he married a woman he never desired in order to mask his frailty. He's never been with a man, though he's desired young Anthony for all his adulthood. Gabriel is in London to escape the sham of his life, and the fact that he has nor remorse over the death of his wife. Part of that escape is his reconnection with Anthony, who is all too eager to initiate Gabriel into the delights of man-love. The other, is gambling. 
 These two star-crossed lovers have unknown hurdles to surmount. Anthony, as NO ONE knows is dyslexic. He has no ability to read any of the hundreds of missives he receives regarding his estates or society invitations. He attends the Houses of Parliament in person because he has a fantastic memory for all he sees and hears, and this is how he manages in society. 
 Gabriel is ashamed for his trysts with Anthony, but he is more ashamed by the debts he is accruing with his nightly visits to the gambling dens. 
 I loved Anthony--he is so kind and heart-on-his-sleeve. Gabe, well, he's a self-loathing man, which is hard to warm to, especially as he's rather a poor partner to Anthony. Still, he redeems himself, and his debts, which are numerous and great. I respected that, and I also respected the solution that he created to keep them together. This is an HEA with some of the recurrent characters from the Gambling on Love series making significant appearances--though one does not need to read those books to enjoy this one. 
 I liked the story, but I almost felt it was a bit too long--and Gabe's penchant for hiding EVERYTHING from everyone got irritating. I wanted to shake him, and smack him, and shake him again. That said, I liked him in the end. And I always loved Anthony, so I was anxious for his HEA.

 This is the third, and possibly final, book in the Cronin's Key series. Alec MacAidan is the key to the survival of the human species. He's only been a vampire for the past 18 months, but he's the Chosen One, if you will, so he's had a busy time of it. I think it's a bit hard to pick this series up at the end, but, having read all the previous books, it's a fantastic adventure/romance. 
 In this book, the enemy is a group of otherworldly beings of lycan origin who call themselves Zoan. They are shapeshifters who can also stop time. The Zoan arrived on earth through a portal that opened straight from Hell, and Alec must figure out how to kill them, and shut down the portal before the world is under attack. Alec possesses every talent, or power, ever gifted to the vampire race, and he must use all of them to defeat the Zoan--if he can catch them. 
 In the meantime, petrified Zoan are being awakened all over the earth and new portals are opening. It's another race-against-time if Alec, Cronin and their band of vamps will have any chance to save mankind. 
 This is a fantastic adventure, though I had a few struggles with the fast pace and the constant motion. Part of the plot hinges on understanding the portals, where they are and how they work, and this means Alec must leap his group of vamps all over the world--in rapid succession--to investigate potential portals. At times, I think I was getting leaping sickness. I didn't get the ""physics"" behind the portals and parts where it was described, of which there are a few, dragged for me. 
 That said, Alec is faced by a foe he cannot initially defeat; the Zoan are ancient and possess power greater than his. Cronin is very sincerely worried that this battle may be the last. And, he's partly right. I think the idea of a vampire afterlife was remarkable, and I enjoyed how that was rendered. 
 There are so many characters in this series that have become dear to me, and I want to continue reading their stories of adventure. I've truly enjoyed the historical ""borrowing"" Ms. Walker has done to create Cronin and Alec's world and experiences, masking bouts of ""extreme vampire and Zoan activity"" into human tragedy and war has been a fun exercise in thought. 
 Plus, the bond of love between Cronin and Alec is so lovely I had to giggle a little at Alec's jealousy when encountering Cronin's former lover. Oh, the intensity! And insanity... ;) Poor Alec and Cronin! They just love each other to pieces--and that's what Alec left behind of the world's largest glacier when his temper took control. There are some tender bits, and I found Alec's newest talent--stopping time--was certainly put to most excellent use when he decided some lovin' was needed RIGHT NOW! Fun! I highly recommend this series.",Fri Sep 18 04:12:59 -0700 2015,Fri Sep 18 04:14:16 -0700 2015,Wed Sep 16 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,4,0

 Wilson is a chef, and recently de-closeted Alabaman, who was supposed to spend two weeks with his closeted lover, Rod, a sheriff in his hometown, but Rod won't be seen with Wilson, now, and Wilson's restaurant is failing because his customers are shunning the establishment. Even now, Wilson's friend and second chef reports that. Us invests has picked up since Wilson is out of the kitchen. 
 Wilson is astounded by the out-and -proud crowd at his resort. He knew he and Rod would have been welcomed, but seeing gay couples frolic, kiss, hold hands and dance together is a scenario Wilson had never dreamed of--nor is the proposition by Adam and Simon: to be their third. 
 Adam and Simon have never bedded a third more than once, but there exists a connection, an attraction, that they want to pursue, as long as Wilson will let them. Expect a lotta sexytimes. Expect some friction when these fun and games become something...more. Simon's mortified that he's developing serious feelings for Wilson, and Adam's overjoyed because he'd like Wilson to be a permanent part of their lives. But how does Wilson feel about all this? With the end of his vacation looming he has some pretty important decisions to make. 
 This was a pretty breezy, sexy read. Some obstacles arise; conflict regarding Wilson's intentions, his future, meeting parents, the resort being sold to a predatory homophobe, personnel issues at the resort, Rod coming to his senses....and the resolution to all these issues was low key and quick, bordering on too convenient. The guys are totally instinct driven, and their instincts lead them to each other. If the book had had deeper conflict, I probably couldn't have swallowed how easily it all worked out, yet, this story isn't that type of story. The biggest conflicts are internal, and they are mostly resolved with sexytimes, which I honestly didn't mind at all.

 Cal is a 24 y/o man trying valiantly to support his ailing great uncle, Nascha, and his strong, mentally challenged brother, Keir. Keir has many emotional/psychological/intellectual issues which require medications that Cal cannot always afford though Call works full time as a busboy at the local casino-hotel and also as a freelance fisherman. Nascha has wanted to sell his property to his tribe, knowing the waterfront property will fetch enough money to care for both Nascha and Keir while allowing Cal to live an unencumbered life, but Cal won't allow him to, because he won't fail in his duty to the family. 
 Cal is injured in the beginning of the story, which sets their precarious budget into complete disaster. Still, Cal attempts to soldier on. 
 Avery has a boyfriend who doesn't respect him, and parents who don't respect his out gay lifestyle--always referring to his BF as a ""friend"" and expecting he'll fail in his endeavors. In the aftermath of the breakup, Avery plans to move out of state--to Bluewater Bay where his favorite show, Wolf's Landing, is filmed. He is well-known as a fan fic writer for the show, and has many ""virtual"" friends via his involvement in the Wolf's Landing websites. His trip to Bluewater Bay is hampered by car trouble and cash problems, and he's rescued by Cal and Keir--who bond over Avatar and Wolf's Landing trivia. 
 Cal and Avery form a cautious connection. It is sweet, and tender. Which is a huge departure for both men. Cal isn't sure he can give Avery what he needs, and Avery's afraid to lose his heart, but they are so lonely, and need this connection desperately. 
 The writing is so vivid, with powerful emotions, real problems, and deep connections. Life is hard, and it gets harder for Cal before the end. Still, the end is more sweet than bitter, with realistic resolutions for Nascha, Keir, Cal and Avery. You will not be disappointed, I believe, by tagging along on this one.

He's had several close calls with death that were averted by inexplicable means. While chasing down a suspect one rainy night he's disturbed by the perp knowing not only his true name, Ailig, but also by the claim that he must go to Cronin, and find some key, to avert war. Oh, and by this stranger exploding into dust in his very arms. 
 This is only further compounded by Cronin appearing at the police station and taking Alec away by quantum leap. Alex can't control his feelings around Cronin, and this is explained, much to Alec's dismay, by Alec being Cronin's FATED mate. And, hilariously, that's even more upsetting than learning that Cronin and his two trusted confidants, Eiji and Jodis, are all centuries-old vampires. 
 Really, it's the writing (not the vamps) that sparkles here. The humor and pace are both brisk, and excellent. Alec doesn't like the idea that he is matched to Cronin without his consent. Not that Cronin isn't delicious. Because he is. He's over 6 feet of sexy ginger vampire, originally from Scotland. He is also Old World in manners and sensibilities. And he's thwarted in his desire because sexual relations with Alec will turn him into a vampire, and a new prophesy has a very human Alec sitting squarely in the midst of a brewing war. 
 I really enjoyed this one! The historical references were seamlessly interwoven and the new enemy on the horizon is interesting and dangerous. I loved how Alec took all Cronin's revelations with aplomb and humor--and I loved how Cronin and Alec took advantage of the few days they had to make the most of their budding relationship. The sexual tension was delicious, and the advancement of their ""courtship"" was so sweet. The battle scenes were fantastic, and the story was completely wound up in the resolution.

 Tom is a 44 y/o divorced man who came out five years ago ending his marriage. He is a successful, renown architect, and his first serious boyfriend, 22 y/o Cooper, is also an architect. 
 It was hard for Tom to come to terms with his attraction for Cooper in the first book in this series, but now that he and Cooper have been dating for a couple of months they are beginning to break the news to their close friends and family. 
 Tom's son Ryan already knows--he was a college friend of Cooper and visited Tom's Manhattan apartment often enough to catch Toma and Cooper early on. He's come to terms with it, but Tom's ex-wife is stunned. Sofia was Tom's college sweetheart, and devastated by the divorce. Plus, she's only known Cooper as Ryan's friend--the introduction as Tom's beau is...awkward? Nope, not a strong enough word. Add a few F-bombs in front and the picture becomes clearer. 
 Cooper is convinced that Sofia is still in love with Tom, and he's probably right. Expect some harsh words and a fly-by of Tom's parents who would NOT understand. 
 Cooper's family is less-than-enthusiastic, too. Funny how parents get miffed when your boyfriend is older than your dad... 
 The fast pace of both Tom and Cooper's jobs is also a balancing act. Tom is appreciative that they share architecture in common--so they can spend late nights poring over plans and drafting boards together. That was especially sweet. 
 Honestly, there is a lot of heart here, and I really dug the way I saw Tom and Cooper grow together as a couple. It is apparently true for people of every age that censure builds a stronger bond. For all slings and arrows sent Tom and Cooper's way, their affection increases exponentially. By the end, Tom gets Cooper exactly where he needs him, and that was super sweet. 
 There are some down moments and melancholy bits, but this is a solid romance so expect happiness by the end and some sexytimes--though I'd have liked a bit more of those!!!

 Madeline Gracechurch is a proper young Englishwoman whose stepmother and father wish to have settled favorably with a husband. At 16, Maddie is unable to mix in company, however, She suffers intense agoraphobia and knows that she will disgrace her family if pressed into London's social marriage network. She's a devoted penpal to her ""afianced"" however, one Captain Logan MacKenzie, A Highland Scot fighting the French--who happens to be entirely fictitious. She sends him letters and sketches, and arranges to have return letters from him delivered from him. 
 This charade continues for years, Maddie feeling bad, but not entirely. She expects that her letters are being trashed somewhere, entertainment for anonymous troops who think her a flighty girl. Remorse does set in when her godfather gifts her a Highland estate so that she and Captain MacKenzie will be comfortable upon his return. She decides to end this ruse, now some eight years old, by reporting the death of the valiant Captain. She mourns him properly, vows to never wed and decamps form her father's home to her Highland estate, in the company of her ""ruined"" spinster Aunt Thea. 
 Maddie has been comfortable in her estate for two years now. She has a tidy income from her scientific drawings and the working farm. She is a good mistress, knowing her tenants and ensuring their welfare. What she is not is a woman looking for a man, and one appears on her doorstep out of the bonny blue sky: Captain Logan MacKenzie. 
 Not just the good captain, he has brought some of his displaced soldiers with him. To stay. Yes, Logan exists, and he received many a letter from a foolish English lass he expected to be decrepit or club-footed or have some gross malformation that rendered her unsuitable for marriage. The young, delicate comely woman who is terrified by his brawn (and assertion that they be married posthaste) is not at all whom he expected to find. 
 Logan has has a bad time of life. Abandoned by his parents, left as an orphan and pressed into His Majesty's service by his ""adoptive"" family, Logan has never known a real home, nor real love. He doesn't believe in it, and figures that the spoils young Maddie received by conning her family ought to suit him and his cast-off men who have nowhere to live after all their sacrifices for the Crown. 
 Aunt Thea is overjoyed, and canny. She wants her Maddie to have a love-filled life, and this rugged Highlander seems to fit the bill. Maddie, for her part, is attracted and intrigued, but she agrees to handfast her captain only because he threatens to reveal her subterfuge to all of London's society. 
 It's a big mess, of Maddie's own creation as she acknowledges, and she womans up. She makes her vows, but allows herself some time to adjust to married life. In particular, she forestalls the consummation of their marriage in the hope that she can locate MacKenzie's cache of her letters and destroy the evidence thereby unsealing their deal. In the meantime, they spend quite a bit of time together, managing the estate. Maddie's even prepared to hand this over to Logan, in return for him letting her be, but Logan knows how the English change their minds and take back what they give in Scotland. So he won't be having any of her deals. 
 Plus, he's mighty attracted. His initial lust tempers into admiration when he sees how compassionate she is to all those around her estate. A true affection blossoms between Maddie and Logan, one that is fierce. It scares both Logan and Maddie, but Maddie takes steps to protect her heart--until she recognizes that Logan's armor guards him too closely for very good reason. 
 Maddie and Logan are two excellent characters. While Logan is a battle hardened man, he's not a brute. He's educated and appreciates Maddie's peculiarities. Maddie practically swoons when she find him reading her treasured copy of Pride and Prejudice, yet she can't allow herself to believe such a beautiful physical specimen could truly love her. In fact, she very much believes Logan when he tells her he cannot. 
 There are some delightful sexytimes. Maddie is a virgin, and Logan has been celibate ever since Maddie's letters began arriving. He lived a modle life to give his men hope, and when the letters started he couldn't set a bad example of carousing when the men believed he had a steadfast sweetheart. It has created a serious back-up of lust for Logan to carry. Logan's selflessness is a problem through the story--all the way to the very end, and yet, it's his most endearing quality.

 Jim has many issues-he's an alcoholic and just coming to terms with his sexuality, at age 27. He's pretty sure that he's not into women. Because, while he's always dated women, he can only get off sexually while imagining yaoi-a type of Japanese erotic comic. Essentially, yaoi is gay graphic art, and Jim has been hooked on it since he was a teen. 
 Jim was raised in an affluent home, but he walked away after his homophobic father, a powerful cardiovascular physician, learned of his yaoi interests. Now, eleven years later, Jim is finally getting his life together. His best work pal, Billy, has hired him on as stie manager for a tenant improvement project while Billy and his new husband go on their honeymoon. All Jim must do is complete the physical-which brings him close to Dr. Ken Tanaka, the living embodiment of Jim yaoi fantasies. Dr. Tanaka is a young, brilliant cardiologist who is investigating the severity of Jim's newly diagnosed heart murmur. 
 Teaser #3 - Knave Of Broken HeartsAnd that's a big problem because being anywhere close to Dr. Tanaka makes Jim's heart pound. 
 Ken Tanaka is the dutiful son of Japanese immigrants. His mother has finally stopped trying to convince Ken to marry a suitable Japanese girl, but Ken's not sure that he's able to appease his mother by dating the gay men she arranges for him, either. See, Ken's totally, unethically drawn to his patient, Jim. He practically pants for Jim's burliness and honesty, and is frustrated that (ha, ha!) all the good ones are straight. 
 They find themselves in close quarters more than once, and the chemistry is off the charts. Jim, despite his fantasies, has not had a gay encounter since his first sexual partner at 16 and Ken is a desirable man-one other men and women find very attractive. How can he, a high school dropout and self-taught construction supervisor be a catch for his sexy cardiologist? Also, Jim's distracted by his new roommate-his 18 y/o younger brother whose been kicked out for coming out as gay. Ian's a sweet boy, eager to please and get on with his interrupted life, and becomes a fantastic confidant to his sexually-confused elder brother. 
 I so loved the interplay between expectation and reality, here. Both Ken and Jim want each other, but neither will take the first step on account of believing that it will go nowhere. Plus, Jim isn't sure he can be with a man-at first. But life takes a strange turn when friends of the boy Ken is set up with turn out to have criminal intent and Jim is called to rescue Ken from some pretty dire circumstances. Their proximity is too much for Jim to resist-especially when Ken wants him so openly. 
 Still,it's a tricky business, this coming together. Jim and Ken have professional and personal responsibilities that aren't going away, and at least one man's heart is set for breaking. I really enjoyed the slow burn, and struggled with the complications of this love story. Jim is a closet case, with lucrative reasons for staying so, and Ken has a lot of family pressure to accept his mom's hand-picked husband candidate. There's a good bit of bitter to go with the sweet here, as both men figure out the way to make their plans and their attractions work in concert. I loved the steamy bits and only wished it was a bit rosier of a story-but appreciated the honest issues that plagued both Ken and Jim. Jim has to choose to come out, and Ken has to choose to stand up to his parents-neither are easy choices for them to make. The HEA was excellent after all that turmoil.",Mon Aug 24 06:59:05 -0700 2015,Mon Aug 24 07:00:42 -0700 2015,Sun Aug 16 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,3,0

 Rafi Castro is a man raised in Chicago, though his parents are from the Dominican Republic. He is Afro-Latino and has lived a hardscrabble life, mostly raised by his four elder sisters, once his mother returned to her home country. He met Denny two years before when Denny ran away from home and stayed with his cousin, and Rafi's boss, Cash--who is in books one and three of the series. Denny was only 17 then but he had a fierce crush on 19 y/o out and proud Rafi, and they spent a lot of sexually-ripe but platonic time together, excepting one kiss the final day of Denny's stay, and once he'd turned 18. 
 Now, Rafi is headed to Carlisle College on a diversity-based rowing scholarship. And Denny is awaiting him. Both men are sophomores now, and on the rowing team together. Rafi is determined to be his own man--fearing that everyone will look at him like a charity case, and sure that both Cash and Denny pulled strings to get his scholarship. He's not wrong--some of his teammates do think that. And, it's likely true that Cash's connections assisted in Rafi's acceptance, but Rafi's behavior demonstrates a level of closing in that borders paranoia. He doesn't want to accept any of Denny's plentiful offers at touring the campus, or helping him adjust to college life. 
 Rafi is, quite plainly, unable to deal. His assignments are coming back with poor grades, one of his teammates seems continually ready to put him down, and Denny is just too perfect, too rich, too beautiful to understand all the (imaginary) demons that plague Rafi--if Rafi would once bother to talk to Denny about his fears. 
 On the other hand, Rafi is totally gone for Denny, and can't bear to push him away too long. I wanted, seriously, to punch Rafi in the throat for a large part of the book. I have been the scholarship kid, living on financial aid and work-study jobs. I get pride, I really do, but Rafi is beyond prideful. He's so proud he comes off as ashamed, and honestly, I think that he was ashamed. He fought all through high school to be this out-proud guy, but the second he steps onto Carlisle's campus he clams up. He has friends on the team who are out, but he can't bear to even look at Denny in a way that might could indicate interest. He doesn't want to be ""Denny's boy"" and yet his denial speaks volumes. 
 For his part, Denny is often too patient. He wants Rafi to be his serious boyfriend, but makes it clear that he won't wait forever. Their dynamic is so fraught. I wanted Rafi to come around, but he was SO obstinant--again causing my fist to curl in readiness. Every time it looked as if they got into synch, there was a catastrophe. And Rafi's temper is a real issue. I was glad that his friend, Austin, was honest about it and that Rafi finally began to ask for the help he absolutely needed. 
 The end is an HEA that is hard fought and harder won. Expect Rafi to be a confused prick for 90% of his love story. There is no convenience in this story. There is Rafi learning how to be a boyfriend through error after error, and finally being a big enough person to speak his truth, and make amends for his bad behavior. Denny is a calm breeze in the hot/cold hurricane of Rafi's regard. Still, he has issues. I really thought the discussion of PrEP and the stigma of its use was refreshing. I got all Rafi's protectiveness, and was glad to see he turned all that mental energy into something productive--figuring out a career path that works to his strengths.

 The story is set on Earth, more than a century from now. After more than 100years of constant aggression to settle interests in the world, the US military struggled to recruit new soldiers. So, it's scientists created a virus with which to infect its soldiers to generate supersoldiers, and a poison pill to its enemies at the same time. The effect was devastating, leaving an airborne virus that caused Rot, degeneration of the skin and brain and yielding revenants: hungry, carnivorous uncontrollable humans who are for all intents and purposes zombies. 
 Rhys has lived in a sheltered community, an abandoned monastery in rural Oregon, for the past 7 years-- since age 12. His mother died two years ago and the only remaining adults were Father Maurice and his son, Jacob. They despised Rhys--having suspected him of being a homosexual from his youth--and routinely beat and starved him. Jacob was given Rhys's younger sister as a bride, in accordance with Father Maurice's demands, and the book opens with Rhys positioned as bait for marauding revenants while the good Father, Jacob, Rhys's sister and nephew all escape. Only, it doesn't go down like that. Rhys fights back--still trying to distract the ""revs"" and is nearly overcome when the cavalry arrives. And, by cavalry, I mean the original infected supersoldiers. 
 The soldiers of Project Juggernaut are super in every way: strength, stamina, accuracy. They take down the revs, but not before Rhys' sister, nephew and the Father are killed. Jacob, that miserable abusive gobshite survived because he ran, leaving his ""wife,"" toddler son, and father to be attacked. 
 The ""Jugs"" aren't sure what to do with Rhys and Jacob. The are clearly at risk for Rot, but the medic officer argues that transmission of the original virus--via copious sexual intercourse with the Jugs--could help Rhys and Jacob develop immunity to the mutated strain causing Rot before they develop symptoms. It's a super longshot, and the platoon commander, Darius, is reluctant. Previous Jug leaders had created mini-empires by capturing civilians and raping them into submission--creating new Jugs in the process, and Darius is loathe to taste that power. Rhys even volunteers to die, knowing that he's likely infected, and this changes something for Darius. He's intrigued by Rhys, who is so small and scrawny and fierce at the same time. 
 All of this happens in the first 50 pages, or so. It is fascinating! All those years of being punished (beaten and starved) by Father Maurice and Jacob for his ""unnatural perversion,"" and yet, given the choice of Rot or Jug life, Rhys remains hesitant while Jacob is only to happy to drop trow. Rhys' scared out of his mind of developing Rot, and sure that Jacob will find some way to torment him if he shows any inclination of enjoyment of sex. As the platoon makes it's way back to camp, Rhys and Jacob submit to the ""treatment"" and I don't mean this in any porny way, at all. It is rough and brutal, and some non-consent is part of the bargain. It affects Darius, who becomes inordinately possessive of Rhys--against his own better judgement. 
 I absolutely loved this story. It was an intriguing look at ethics and morality in a post-apocalyptic world. And, I dug that the author flipped the script on man-on-man action--making it vital to Rhys and Jacob's survival. Growing up in the HIV/AIDS era as I have, and being disgusted by the dismissal of it as a ""gay plague"" that too many smugly thought well-deserved, I could appreciate the irony and also the necessity of this device. I so wanted Rhys to come to terms with his issues--but it is truly all he can do to keep up with the fast-paced Jug patrol and also keep out of Jacob's line of fire. Rhys doesn't mind having a sexual partner--Darius, actually--but the treatment is to ""inoculate"" him with as many variants of the strain as possible, which means multiple partners daily. 
 The story is simply brilliant in its treatment of bullying, the balance of power, life after bioholocaust, and the need to live a good life, as good as possible, in extreme situations. I was captivated from the beginning. There are a few tender moments, and many that aren't so tender. That said, this is a romance, and you can expect an HEA for Rhys--but only after he is pulled so far through the plot-wringer that he's *almost* superhuman.

 Blake ""Rolex"" Raleigh is an American multimillionaire financier who often has business in London. He's been at the upscale gay brothel, Market Garden, many times, and had his two fave (now retired) rentboys recommend another partner, Jason, to engage on his next visit. Blake is immediately attracted to Jason, and intrigued by the negotiation game that Jason sets up for their time together. They are both seemingly into the sex, and Blake is happy to continue to offer more and more money to keep Jason on the clock for his entire trip. 
 Afterward, they keep in touch via email and text, and Jason plans a super sexy Skype for Blake, keeping Blake fully invested in buying his time when he next returns to London. As the time of the book spans several weeks/months, the connection deepens. Please do not expect monogamy, or a Pretty Woman ending. That is not even close, here. Still, a rapport blooms, especially when Blake and Jason spend a week together off the clock (and practically off the grid). Leaving Jason that time was inexplicably hard for Blake, and it triggers a new desire--one that includes the possibility for a relationship within Jason's parameters. 
 Jason has a money fetish. The more money he's offered, the more turned on he becomes--and the more outlandish acts he will do for his johns. At first this seemed especially opportunistic, but it works for Blake who gets off on being wealthy enough to never care how his money is spent. And, it really plays into Blake's voyeuristic side. The seix is copious and hot, yet, Blake never treats Jason as his possession. He enjoys watching nearly as much as participating, so the idea of Jason being his monogamous partner isn't a deliberate focus. He does want to be more than a john, however, and there are some tense negotiations on that point. I think it worked out for them, in a Happy For Now type of ending. Lots of ""let's see how this goes"" and ""cross that bridge"" stuff happening in the end. 
 If you want declarations of undying love and monogamy and Jason quitting prostitution in order to keep Blake's home fires stoked, well, um, nope. This book is not for you. 
 If you want steaming sex scenes, of the two, three, and four participant variety, and two decent guys finding a compatible situation, even if it includes being ""open""? This is your book. 
 It struck me, especially as I was lamenting the lack of Pretty Womanishness, that this book likely describes the kind of relationships sex workers and porn stars may have with people who are (or aren't) in the business. While that's not in my sweet spot at a reader, it was handled in a clear and interesting way. I liked Jason and Blake, both guys are kind and considerate. They have fun with each other. They have hot sex, and it's judgment-free. Blake's feelings take a while to develop, and I can only guess at Jason's motivation because his POV is not part of the book but he seemed to make concessions to be with Blake, and not only because he knew Blake would pay him for his time. Little things, like meeting him at the airport, and taking Blake back to his flat, hinted at a deepening affection. Which I liked very much.

 There be spoilers....you are now warned. 
 This is the second book in a series, and should be read in order. This is also not a COMPLETE series, in that the book ends without the complete story arc ending. Expect book three! 
 In this sequel, Sam, an FBI special agent hunting a serial killer who preys on young gay men, and Mac, a wealthy, (almost un-)closeted gay man, find love with each other. Yep, HEA for them! Yay! It takes a long time to get there, however. First, Sam has to forgive himself for being a lousy husband at age 20. He does a whole lotta soul searching, in addition to taking care of his ""questioning"" teenaged nephew, his newly homophobic battered sister, making time to travel for Mac hook-ups and coming face-to-face with the woman whose heart he broke all those years ago. Sam has always come off as an insensitive jerk, but his shell is well and truly cracked. His vulnerability is delicious and comforting at the same time. 
 Mac has his own sordid past to unravel, and it includes a maniacal best friend and her two 4 y/o's who are his kids, from a different daddy. Mac is a straight-up love. I love him. Really. What a guy. If Sam could change for anyone, Mac was the one. 
 We still have a serial killer, ""Leviticus,"" on the loose but we know for sure who he is and who he's damaged. He's got the terrible love for one of the secondary characters and the terrible hate for another--and frankly both emotions are deadly. I'm not really sure of the body count at this point but it might be in the 20's. It's always the quiet ones, amiright? 
 I'll admit wanting this book to bring Leviticus to justice, but he's a slippery eel and therefore slips away. I expect our next installment will bring in the love of several more of the characters--which is exciting, too. Another NYC-Houston connection seems to be in the offing, and some young love via Sam's nephew and the androgynous model/homeless teen Sasha. I was so glad to see some resolution to Sam's dilemma with his sister, and of course the LOVING between Sam and Mac is epic.

The setting is 1890s London and men are not allowed, legally, to have sexual relations with each other. (But boy-howdy, do they!) 
 They meet because Robert has a ghost inhabiting his ancestral home. He calls out Simon, who has the ability to communicate with spirits, by means of writings that etch across his skin, when he is in the presence of a ghost. It is horrifying and fascinating to Robert, and the manner of expulsion of his ancestral ghost is sexy-sexy. This was actually so fascinating to read. It could have gone campy, but it never did. 
 Each chapter is a case; all of them have some heat between Simon and Robert, mostly as a way for Simon to disgorge the coldness that saps him while communing with spirits. I honestly could not get enough of this couple. There could have been a hundred chapters and I'd have continued turning the pages. There are little threads woven in the stories which connect one to the next, but each is unique and interesting while building on the developing love story between these two men. 
 I won't say this is tender, because it isn't. There is tenderness at times, but often it's harsh and necessary couplings. The desperation they both experience, amid life-and-death encounters kept me captivated. THere is incredible tenderness in their small gestures--the ones which need to be hidden to protect them both. Political machinations, revenge plots, destruction, self-sacrifice--it's all in here. The journal-style of the writing allows an intimate look into Robert's side of the story and he's just a dream of an MC. He so adores Simon that it's impossible not to love Simon through Robert's POV. 
 I adored the historical setting, and the old-style British grammar and spellings. I felt like I was there, as gorgeously and clearly as the settings were described. Nothing like a good ghost story--and this book is chock full of good ones.

I had a brief recap of the previous book in this one, and I'm kinda glad I skipped that book, on account of I get triggers over evil-scientist plots....but that's MY issue. 
 John and Ryan are two men who have always had straight relationships but have recently embarked on a relationship with each other. They came to terms with their bisexuality in the first book, and are just trying to figure this ""gay thing"" out. This causes a lot of conflict within their families. 
 John is a divorced man with two teenaged children, Mark and Torey. He doesn't have joint custody, but Mark had run to John in the previous book, and currently lives with John and Ryan, with his mother's grudging permission. John's ex, Cynthia, is not cool with the ""gay thing""--she and her husband are blatantly homophobic. Cynthia lives in LA with Torey, and John tries to keep a decent relationship for his daughter's sake. 
 Ryan's family is mixed; one brother is totally okay with his orientation, his father and other brother are not. Well, dad's kinda okay, and he gets better, but Brent is really hostile. I had to give props to his bride-to-be, Anne, who makes Brent adjust his attitude. 
 Ryan and John are stable, and love each other, but they have a lot of stress--Ryan is a medical student, recovering from burn injuries suffered as a fire fighter. He had recently saved Mark from a fire, and John, Ryan and Mark suffer nightmares over that ordeal. John is a parent, and has the associated parental worries, especially as Mark begins to close in emotionally, and Torey's calls from LA are becoming more regular and more upsetting--she hates her stepfather, and Cynthia is sick with pregnancy issues (and perhaps depression). 
 (view spoiler)[The stress peaks when Torey and Cynthia turn up on their Wisconsin doorstep, essentially destitute. Ryan is afraid that John will reconnect with his pregnant ex, and all his heart will be broken--plus he will have come out and estranged himself for nothing. John is a stalwart and the best kind of man. He only cares for Cynthia in that she's the mother of his kids and soon to deliver his kids' half-sister. His love is really more of agape, than amore. I didn't wonder much regarding Ryan's angst. (hide spoiler)] Both Mark and Torey really like Ryan, and want him to remain their dad's partner--and perhaps more. 
 This book is big on reality. It deals with the mundane in an approachable way. Life is messy, and Ryan and John's life is especially messy. At times I wondered if the stress would break them apart, but they consistently took steps to come closer; even if Ryan's motives seem selfish. It's funny, though. People say love is selfless, and it isn't always. Motives can indeed be selfish, and still be the right thing to do. Ryan has a right to be suspicious of Cynthia's motives. She is a crafty gal, and focused on finding a good provider for her infant--and John is a demonstrated good provider. 
 The end of this book is not the end of this story, I'm sure, but it does end with a solid resolution and a solid HEA. There are some nice sexytimes that, again, are realistic. First times and fun times and aborted missions...which only drew me into this relationship more. I think there were plenty of ways for this book to go wrong, to get melodramatic and absurd, but it never did.

Often times I feel like I want more detail in a story, want to know more about a character if a situation, but not this time.

 Laurie is a 37 y/o pre-hospital consultant. I honestly had no idea what this was until I'd completed half the book. Turns out it's a specialized doctor who goes out on scene to assist with stabilizing injured people before they can be brought to the hospital--a medical first-responder who is an actual doctor. He specializes in trauma cases and lives a high stress life as a result. He's terribly alone since his lover of 12 years, Richard, left him 6 years prior. He does go out for random hook-ups but Laurie is an unapologetic sub who needs a man who will take him in a firm hand--and he won't fall in love again, so it's hard for him to develop the trust he needs for more than a random BDSM scene. 
 Out with friends at a BDSM club he sees a startlingly young man, and approaches him to tell him off for crashing the party, only to have this inexplicably fierce, short, pimply 19 y/o man turn the tables entirely. Laurie is blown apart by this Nuevo-Dom, and takes him home, only to break down. His Dom is frustrated with having a fantastic moment ruined by Laurie's callous behavior, and lets him know this--but the two men find solace with each other. It is only the next day that names are exchanged. Toby, the young Dom, is less fierce than Laurie had expected, and the sex is galactic, yet it's all a one-off as far as Laurie is concerned. 
 Thing is, Laurie can't get Toby out of his brain, and is pleased that Toby turns up a week later for another go-round. Afraid that he's developing actual feelings, however, Laurie behaves like an ass again--hoping to drive Toby away. Which he does, for a while. But, Toby's persistent, and he's fully aware that his Dom desires aren't likely to be filled by anyone his own age. Plus, getting a posh man to drop to his knees is really the height of flattery, for Toby. 
 The story spans several months over which time both Toby and Laurie fall arse over teakettle for one another, even if Laurie would rather cut out his own tongue than admit it aloud. The emotions here are raw and so brutally honest. Toby is ruthless emotionally, to himself and Laurie--forcing both of them to see the strengths and frailties of their arrangement. I felt like my own heart was being cuffed up and spread open. Toby needs someone to want him, to care about him, and the only people in his life who seem to do so are his dying Grandad and Laurie. His mom cares, but not in a maternal way; it's too pedestrian for her artistic sensibilities. Laurie's afraid to pledge his heart to a man so young with so much life in front of him. He doesn't want to waste Toby's time--when he thinks Toby will just find a more suitable mate and throw him over. And he feels a bit awkward (read: he's obsessed) about the age gap. 
 It's a delicious character study, and a fantastic read with plenty of kinky sexytimes, but also chock full of tenderness and vulnerability. This is book where the tears shed aren't only mine, but Toby's and Laurie's, too. So much coming to terms with life and its many choices. Of learning to trust, and to give trust. I just adored Toby's POV. He's unfailingly honest and open--something that disarms and charms and frightens Laurie. I was so glad their HEA came! It was also so fun to be in Toby's head as he had his first real and positive experiences as a Dom. I think his youth and exuberance helped soften his sadist side; an older, experienced character would have come off as pompous or cruel--where Toby is more playful in his internal dialogue. Also, I loved how both Toby and Laurie were able to enjoy themselves in a judgment-free sexual zone. The sexytimes are plentiful, but never got boring. I never felt myself skimming.

 It's a fantastic read. 
 Bryce and Clark are former college roommates with a history of unrequited desire and a single kiss. Bryce wanted forever with Clark, and Clark had won a Rhodes scholarship for a graduate degree at Oxford. He didn't want to hurt their friendship, so they never took it further. 
 Fast-forward five years... 
 Clark and Bryce are not friends. They share a lot of friends in common, however, and when Bryce's bar is hosting a booth at the Comic Con, all their pals pitch in to dress like DC Comics characters. Bryce is so thankful for all the support, until he learns that Superman will be played by Clark. He's sick just thinking of all the years that have passed, wishing for a man who is just out of reach. 
 Clark is determined not to make the same mistake he did five years ago: letting Bryce escape. 
 Bryce is prickly and Clark is determined, but respectful. It is heart-grabbing reconnection story between two great guys who need each other--logic be damned.

She works hard and loves her work, something her fiance Devlin, a high-powered attorney, doesn't understand. She's somewhat content with life, until she finds Devlin in a compromising position with a paralegal--it throws off Lou's entire day and she has a wreck of a night at her restaurant--serving a botched meal to an undercover food critic. 
 Al Waters is a London transplant whose scathing food reviews have earned him some fan mail, but few friends. His experience at Louella's is positively sickening, and he's not willing to give the chef another chance to poison him. His review is the beginning of the end for Louella's, and rightly so!--in his opinion. Serving undercooked fish is a health hazard.... 
 Al meets Lou at a bar where she's gone to cry out her sorrows--and they hit it off. Neither of them want to talk about work, but Al's complaints of the city Lou loves earns him a bona fide tour guide--she wants him to love Milwaukee before he leaves it. Thing is, Al starts falling for Lou, and she for him. Neither is really ready to commit to anything--Lou has a restaurant falling apart and Al wishes for bigger cities/writing markets, but their bond is developing. Until Al realizes who Lou is, and how his article killed her restaurant and dreams--and he's sick over it. He tries to make amends, but can't. He tries to walk away, and can't. 
 So he does the only thing he can do--support Lou through it. And fall in love. It's not a one-sided affection. 
 Well, until Lou learns who wrote her restaurant's review, that is.... 
 This was a really sweet story with plenty of heart and well-rounded characters. Lou is a beloved person and chef who had a really really bad day--and she triumphed within her loss. Al was an uptight jerk who melted in Lou's capable hands. He secondary characters are very well-drawn and add a good deal of seasoning to the story. Plus, the love of Milwaukee just pours off the page. I'm a Chicagoan, and this book made ME start to love Milwaukee--a true feat! I really enjoyed the tour throughout the city, and the fun cooking bits and pieces. I honestly would have loved it more had there been any physical heat on the page, but the book is cleaner than my empty dishwasher. Alas. 
 Still, it's a quick read with emotional depth and a few quick twists that kept the story moving. Lots of great tension regarding how and when Lou would find out Al's deception. I wasn't shocked by the bearer of this bad news, and really liked that Lou didn't ever give up or cow to the whims of people who didn't keep her best interests at heart. She's a great character, and the coconut cake recipe at the end made for a sweet finale.

 Honestly, I had a lot of trouble with this book, and considered stopping several times. I didn't, because, at some point, I (in my Pollyanna-ness) had hoped that the characters would be better, do better, learn something. I was disappointed that this was not the case. 
 Mollie, Alex and Veronica are three rich girls at an elite private girls' school outside Philly. They are supposed best friends, but the high-level competition they have with each other to be the ""best"" best friend is more frenemies, than besties. 
 They worry about who is closer to whom. Then, they sabotage each other. It's a masochistic spiral. 
 Alex is a virgin, unwillingly, and beginning to branch out into music, joining a band with some local public school kids. Her self-esteem is non-existent and she can't fathom how to approach her best guy friend, Drew, about her hopeless crush on him. She also begins a low pressure acquaintance with one of her band mates. 
 Alex and Mollie have been best friends since kindergarten, but Mollie's always more interested in her food intake and her boyfriend, Sam, who is as big an asshat as a guy can be. Having a teen son, I know that some guys DO act this way, all sexual manipulation and self-gratification, and I was continually frustrated with Mollie's acquiescence into Sam's sex games. 
 Veronica joined the Alex/Mollie two-some in fifth grade. She's rich and alone, with a father who works/lives on the Pacific Rim and a mother who's constantly hanging with, taking vacations with, her trainer/lover. She has a giant house in which she spends all her time alone, unless she's throwing a party or some dude shows up for a random hook-up. When Alex mentions Drew's interest in her, she tries (and fails) to have a good positive relationship with a guy. They do have a relationship but Veronica is clueless as to what it entails. Mostly, it doesn't entail having sex with other guys--especially not ones dating her friends... 
 The book is rife with sex (some unprotected), drug use, alcohol abuse and self-destructive behavior. There are two families depicted: Alex's with her concerned mother, absent father and cute brother (seriously the best character in the book!); and Drew's with his doting mother, young sisters and alcoholic father. Mollie's fam is uptight & Catholic and yet, inexplicably, has NO presence in her life (or this book), while Veronica's is utterly neglectful and absentee to a criminal degree. 
 The girls are young and dumb, jealous and bitter at the beginning, and they are even more so at the end. I had hoped, at any point that they would make better choices. Alex's really hadn't been THAT egregious until prom rolled around, and any pseudo-sympathy/connection I had developed for her character was rather blanked out. Going along with Mollie's crazytrain instead of BEING HONEST WITH VERONICA AND DREW was a deal breaker for me. Yeah, she sort of recovered, but my respect was lost, and I had had precious little to begin with... 
 I honestly can't believe this is a teen book. It's road map of THE ABSOLUTE WRONG WAY to do everything in a relationship/friendship, and I have a hard time believing teens will connect with the characters or scenarios. The only reason this got 1.5 stars instead of 1 was because the writing was clean and clear.

It's her wedding day and her instincts are screaming to get the heck away from David, the surgical chief of her residency program--and her fiance waiting at the head of the church. Though she had trained herself over the past two years to bow to David's counsel and ignore her inner voice of reason, this time she listens. 
 Wolfe is a more than just a best friend to Gen--he's her soul-brother. David had nearly extinguished their deep friendship, but Wolfe is the one who finds Gen all splayed out in her wedding gown after she jumped through the church window. He scoops her up, up and away and keeps her family at bay while Gen takes a few days to work through her emotions. Memories of life before and after David assail her, and she sees the machinations David set in motion--and it both frightens and sickens her, especially when Gen learns how deep his lies extend to her family and their workplace. He's a classic abuser, in the early ""isolate and detain"" stage, and it's soon after Gen's return that the emotional battery morphs into the physical. Good thing Gen has let her friends--and Wolfe--in on her big secrets. 
 Wolfe is, himself, a man of dark secrets. He and Gen got along so well because she never pushed for his history. She accepted him at their first meeting, which was less than he could do, actually, and he respected her, but now they are sharing her house so that Gen isn't alone in case David attacks. And it's a small house. And Wolfe is a magnetic man. Gen is attracted, and part of her healing is to realize that she's attractive. David spent months and months tearing her confidence to shreds, and Wolfe carefully stitches the pieces back together. Thing is, Wolfe doesn't feel entirely worthy of Gen. He feels tainted by the horrors of his past. The people closest to him, including Gen, are determined to correct that misapprehension. 
 I liked this story for a few reasons: the abuse/abuser trope was realistic, the love story was appropriately-paced, and the characters felt real. Gen and David had a ""perfect"" relationship to all eyes, but within the cracks were deep. As all this is told through Gen's memory she is able to see clearly all the cuts and slights of his control, his emotional battery, and his isolating tactics. It takes her time to unravel all his plans and schemes, and time is a big part of the book. It allows Gen and Wolfe time to reconnect, and to connect. Their relationship prior to Gen's altar dash was always platonic, but her shattered self-esteem is more than Wolfe can accept. He steps in, ruthlessly at times, as a coach and player on the sexual battlefield. Let's just say Gen got her groove back, but it's always going to be friends-with-benefits with Wolfe. He's not going to settle down, because what woman can accept a man with his past, right? 
 Well, probably Gen. Who has loved him as a friend, and now more, since they first met. When he can't accept her love she's gotta protect herself and quit him cold turkey. And that's the second-to-last step on their journey to HEA. There's a good bit of steaming sexytimes, told from both points-of-view, and I liked having Wolfe's brain relish the love Gen slathers on him. Good stuff, that. 
 I had no trouble following this book without reading the first two in the series. I know this is a series, but I didn't need the other players so much. Could have done without at least two-thirds of the ensemble cast. Good thing they didn't take up much of the page count. It's likely that the next book is Arilynn's love story--with a hunky police officer who showed up at Gen's house on a few calls over David.",Mon Jun 01 03:52:50 -0700 2015,Mon Jun 01 03:56:20 -0700 2015,Mon Jun 01 04:29:39 -0700 2015,,1,0

 The Coffin Nails are a Detroit-based motorcycle club. The characters recur, but they are peripheral to the featured couple. 
 ""Ghost"" is a hangaround, son to the secretary of the Coffin Nails and disgraced physician. He lost his license due to helping save Tooth's boyfriend, Lucky, from dying after Lucky was targeted by an organ stealing ring. He has befriended Zara in an online gaming community, and has felt a strong affection grow for her in the five years of their increasingly intimate communications. 
 He learns that Zara has an abusive boyfriend, and also that Zara and the boyfriend are traveling from Milan to NYC, and convinces two of the Coffin Nails to bike there with him and ""rescue"" Zara. 
 Zara actually isn't a woman--he's a 21 y/o man named Luca--and Ghost is mighty pissed. But he's a stand-up guy and he believes Luca is still in trouble and stages a rescue anyway. Luca has been serial raped and maimed since Frederico took him in to settle Luca's dead parents' debts. He has been Frederico's boytoy since the age of 16--and he hates Frederico. He never would have guessed Ghost would truly save him, but he's not unhappy that he does. Thing is, Frederico's family is one that supplies drugs to other Coffin Nails clubs, and is not willing to be embarrassed by a guy who isn't even a club member. 
 In the process of freeing Luca, Ghost becomes indentured to his dad's club, much to his mother's dismay. He also begins to embrace that bisexual side he had never acted upon, much to his father's dismay. 
 There is a revenge plot, and Ghost is a target. Luca and Ghost build a relationship, which one of them sacrifices to save the other. It all turns out good, with all parties happy--and three dead bodies, all of whom the characters agree the world is better off without. 
 I has a little trouble with the convenience factor--Luca is the property of Frederico who is the drug supplier for the Coffin Nails, yet no one knew this... Ghost seems to like Luca a lot--loves him and tells him so--yet does dumb stuff like go out all night because he ""needs space."" The book dragged a bit, for me. Still, it's a good read and didn't give me the heebie-jeebies. Only one death and one mutilation on the page, so that wasn't bad.

 4.25 Stars for this contemporary M/M shifter romance. This is the second book in the Little Bite of Love series, and it is highly recommended to read both in order as they are sequential and share characters and plot elements. Be aware this review may have spoilers for the first story. 
 Hunter Devin is a fierce Enforcer, a half-wolf/half-husky shifter whose once esteemed position as protector to the husky Alpha has been diminished over the past several generations. Now, he is considered little more than a glorified mutt by the pureblood leaders of his former husky clan. Living in the newly-formed Daegan clan that consists of a few powerful families, Hunter is heartsick over having left his lover, Ari Jannsen, behind. 
 Ari's determined to escape his near-captivity. His mother, Skyrah, is determined to ally her family with the Alphas of Hagan clan and is glad to be rid of the half-breed cur who corrupted her precious Ari. Hunter knows if he even approaches Ari's home he will be attacked, and his diminutive Ari may also be caught in the fray. 
 Here's what I loved the most: this book has a tense plot. We have big secrets and double-crosses. We have crazed parents, and others finding their way past homophobia. We have caring and compassionate men and women. We have life-or-death battles that kept me flipping the pages. And, we have (a little) magic. The main heat of this book is told in flashback, with Hunter and Ari lamenting the loss of their clandestine love as distance and circumstance separates them. Because we begin with their separation, reading their lovestory is especially poignant. 
 Of course, there are skirmishes that nearly wipe out the Daegan clan and their pups. The action here is fast and furious. This is a world on the brink of war, with many players seeking to grasp the leadership of the Hagan clan--not least of which is Trip Hagan's homophobic father. Trip, Boone, Kristoff, and Robbie are right in the thick of this book, which means that reading the series in order is really important. 
 I adored the blossoming romance between Ari and Hunter. They are so sweet with each other. As is usual for Cochet's books, the emphasis is on characterization and relationships. All the players in the book are well-drawn and have unique contributions to the story. I was glad that we saw some resolution of the homophobia from the first book, and restoration of broken relationships. The end is sufficient to complete this story, while leaving the door open to another book (my money is on Kristoff finding love!) in this series.",Thu May 21 02:38:25 -0700 2015,Thu May 28 05:50:16 -0700 2015,Sun May 10 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,3,0

 4.25 Stars for this contemporary M/M shifter romance. 
 Tristan ""Trip"" Hagan is an out gay male in his tiny husky shifter community. He would have ordinarily been shunned, but he's the eldest male offspring to the Alpha of his clan. He has a bright, sensitive son, Robbie, who is the next heir to the clan Alpha as Trip is not eligible and Trip's younger brother is unable to produce any pups. Trip had bowed to his father's insistence to marry, despite knowing he was gay, but divorced his wife when he learned that she had a true mate within their clan. Trip may be willing to sacrifice his own happiness for clan loyalty, but he won't ask anyone else to do so. Trip also has a true mate, Boone, his half-wolf/half-husky Enforcer guard. Unfortunately, a mating between a pureblood (Trip) and a half-breed (Boone) is forbidden under clan law. So the men are close confidantes, but never take the next step--sealing their love by making a mating bond. 
 The story is short but well-rounded with interesting secondary characters. Boone and his brother Hunter are both in love with men they cannot have. Being half-breeds, they are a target for scorn and abuse, despite their valiant hearts. There are also some juicy bits of humor to balance out the heartache. The spiders that were too big for the burly huskie shifters to tackle? I died. 
 Within the story is a threat from outside the clan. Trip's father is negotiating an alliance with the nearby wolf pack whose Alpha, Kristoff Trevyn, is indisputably attracted to Trip. Yep. Which is all kinds of awkward, especially as Trip's dad is a raging homophobe. I really admired Kristoff; he is kind and compassionate and drives Boone bonkers. 
 Robbie recognizes that Trip and Boone are meant for each other, and does try to orchestrate events to cultivate that. All of Trip's close comrades do, in fact. When the personal scrutiny of Trip and Boone gets too intense, there are only two choices: inter-clan battle, or separation. The resolution is almost excellent. The only problem becomes the main crux of the heartache that kicks off the sequel.

 This is a solid contemporary read that takes on issues present and potent today: immigration, racism, corrupt police, entrapment, and undocumented persons, all in a hot bed of politically conservative ideology: Florida. 
 Carly's parents were deported to Mexico three years ago. She and her brother, Julio, were born in the US, and stayed behind to work hard for the exorbitant fees charged by El Libratador, a known human smuggler, to bring their parents safely back across the border and Texas desert. She works the graveyard shift at a convenience store because it's quiet enough for her to also study at the same time. She has a favorite customer who comes in nightly, minutes before closing--Cletus Shackleford. One night, as Carly is closing for the night, she sees Cletus being held up by a masked gunman and she jumps into action. 
 Arden Moss, sheriff's son and general ne'er-do-well, hasn't had a good night's sleep in a year, not since his schizophrenic sister died. He blames his father for hushing up her disease and denying her the healthcare that could have kept Amber happy and alive, for fear that it would have harmed his political career. Arden is a known prankster--but he only targets people that have more attitude than sense. He tries to scare his great-uncle Cletus off driving while intoxicated, but the feisty cashier is nearly more than he can handle. 
 It is that moment of kismet which brings these spheres into orbit--though Carly does reject every overture that Arden makes to connect them. He's not physically attracted at first--what Arden wants is a co-conspirator in his pranks. This was something he had done with his sister, and he feels the lack. 
 Over the course of a few weeks, Arden helps Carly find a new, better paying job, and their friendship is tentative, but growing in strength. Carly has missed out on many elements of childhood living with her brother and working for her parents' transit fees. Just as things seem to be going well, Arden's racist father learns of their connection. His entire election platform was on deportation of undocumented immigrants, and his eagerness to separate his son from the (supposed) immigrant filth that is Carly is palpable. 
 Arden is intransigent, but he's also reckless, and when one of his pranks goes awry it is Carly who is under the sheriff's boot. Quick thinking saves her from incarceration, but her parents' transit is in jeopardy. And Carly's big brother is major league ticked off. The only bargain that can be arranged is a ""voluntary"" separation, enforced by the ""good"" sheriff--but will a man of his power use it for good? Or, for his own good... 
 This book was quite a good ride, even if virtually none of it was joyful. Through her relationship with Arden, Carly sees herself the most clear as ever--her life is in service to others, namely her parents. She has sacrificed so much to bring them back, and the final analysis proves she has little to show for all that work. Arden is desperate to have his pain acknowledged. His mother is too tripped out on sedatives, not even sensing her grief after her daughter's death, to really care about Arden's troubles. And his dad is too busy proving to their community that he's a martyr for his office. He sweeps Arden's messes aside, but won't take responsibility for his own missteps. Plus, he's a bona fide racist. 
 Both Arden and Carly have grief to overcome, but the danger in their relationship is accessibility; the Sheriff seems to be fixed on removing Carly from Arden's equation--even if Arden has been better behaved under her diligent influence. 
 The resolution became cloak-and-dagger, and seemed a bit rushed, but the story was otherwise tight, with real issues discussed throughout. I totally loved elderly, ornery Uncle Cletus, his whiskey addiction notwithstanding. This is a solid contemporary teen read which is completely clean on the romance-side of it.

 This book picks up where I AM THE MISSION left off, with Zach still trying to determine if his father is dead, and to hunt down and recover his friend, Howard. Howard became friends with Zach in book one of the series, and helped him run his op in book two--all without the knowledge or consent of The Program, the government agency that procures, trains and manages this group of elite teen assassins to which Zach has belonged for five years. Ever since his father was killed. 
 Over the course of the books, Zach's confidence in The Program--and his handlers Mother and Father--has slipped. Howard was Zach's safety net, one outsider who could attest to his existence in the event that The Program tried to scrub him, but The Program learned about Howard and has taken him into custody. Zach knows they will kill him--and he's determined to ensure that won't happen. 
 Naturally, Mike--Zach's field commander, is up on the score. Not only does Mike know where Howard is, he has a new mission for Zach: eliminate Howard. A good soldier would follow orders, and Zach knows this mission is a test--he fails it spectacularly, not only rescuing Howard but also a girl who is imprisoned with him, Tanya. 
 As with everything in Zach's world, nothing is what it seems. Two things remain true, however: Zach wants to find his father, and Howard is sure he is still alive. Together, Tanya, Howard and Zach search for inroads into The Program's files to learn the truth behind Zach's father's story. They investigate the news story regarding Zach's parents' deaths. They hijack a terminal at a high security research lab. Dogging their steps is Mike, who is equal parts ally and hunter. 
 It is a thrill ride, sure to keep readers turning the pages. I loved both previous books in this series, and Zach is a fascinating sociopath. Somewhere in this morass of murder and mayhem he has grown the conscience The Program believed it had snuffed out. His decisions are no longer guided by a faulty directive, and his quest to save his father and friends renders him inarguably human. 
 I had expected both of the big twists--with no lack of enjoyment--and gloried in Zach's triumphs. The big themes, government intrusion, research ethics, mind control, and the growth of the industrial military complex, are all present, but are far overshadowed by Zach establishing trust, redeeming himself, putting others before his own mission. As a conclusion to this series, it is excellent. 
 Some readers may balk at the teen assassin aspects of this book, and how otherworldly capable The Program's agents are, but it was akin to The Bourne Identity, for me. The pace of the book is extraordinarily fast, with not a spare word to be found. I have a hard time imagining there will be a reader over age 12 who takes more than a day to finish this book.

His mother died when he was a child, and his father, a Fire Inspector, is not a demonstrative man. Grif essentially raised himself, and in high school got sucked into the large and lively Anastagio family. They became his surrogate parents and siblings, with Dante his best friend since fire school. He was married shortly before the attacks on 9/11, but his grief and PTSD from being a first responder rendered him moody and uninterested and his wife left him. 
 Since then, Grif has been a shadow brought to life with the Anastagio's, Dante in particular. For years now, he and Dante have caroused, ""satisfying"" NYC's plethora of willing women wishing for the thrill of bedding FDNY hunks. Dante is a vibrant love-'em-and-leave-'em guy--with the face and bod of an Italian god. He's generous to a fault, always opting to help a friend in need, and rehabbing a run-down brownstone that's way too expensive for his three job income. 
 Grif's hunger for Dante develops over years, but at this point in the story it is enormous--so much so that, when Grif learns Dante's plan to do a bit of solo porn for cash, well, Grif's about to explode--with lust. He thinks finding another man, on the SUPER down-low, will help him get over the lust for Dante. (He's super guilty about this attraction, BTW, constantly thinking: How messed up is he that he lusts for his pseudo-brother, right?) 
 The hard truth Grif must face is that he LOVES Dante, and that is in the biblical sense. Dante's money troubles are so great that one ""shoot"" isn't enough--and he begs Grif to ""help him out"" on camera. Grif cannot say no. What remains is a love story that captivated me. The sexytimes are so hot. The firemen are so hot. There are gorgeous subplots, and jealous lovers. Coming out in the FDNY is a dangerous prospect, but so is loving your best friend, as Grif learns. I almost died in the big fire scene--and so did one of the characters! 
 The language of this book is bold, brash and in-your-face. Grif pulls no punches about FDNY, 9/11, fire bunnies, Dante, and even his emotionally distant father. He also has some of the funniest in-head swearing I've ever read. And about 800 euphemisms for male self-pleasure. I adored all of them! Even if Grif wasn't a 6'3"" Scots-American who wears his kilt while bouncing the door at his local watering hole, I'd have loved him to pieces. The fact that I have THAT visual only makes me love him more... 
 It's no doubt that I'll be recommending this book for long time. It is all the best of romantic fiction, with great leads I cheered for the entire book. Definitely a Top 100 pick!",Mon May 18 04:13:27 -0700 2015,Mon May 18 04:14:13 -0700 2015,Fri May 15 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,1,0

She's recently disabled due to a hockey injury which has left her with little feeling below the knees. She is in a wheelchair most of the time, but is gaining strength with braces and crutches. She has significant difficulty navigating many areas of her historic campus. Still, she wanted out her home where her parents can't stop hovering, and is overjoyed that her roommate, Dana, is cool. And, it doesn't hurt that the most delicious man on campus, hockey star Adam Hartley, is just across the hall. 
 Hartley, as everyone calls him, is an all-around decent guy with one giant problem--his leg cast. He busted up his leg falling off a rock-climbing wall--while drunk. He's mentally furious, and physically challenged, but he and Corey make friends quickly--and, despite all Corey's fervent wishing, they will remain friends. Hartley has a super-wealthy, super model-esque, girlfriend, Stacia, who is soon to depart for a study abroad quarter in Europe. No way Hart-throb will toss the girl for a gimp, right? 
 Okay, I'm just in awe of this book. There are so many great things to say, like, I really loved Corey. She wasn't perfectly positive, but she was absolutely determined to make it in college. She struggled, as I think many wheelchair-bound people do, with the way she was treated. As if she was fragile, or simple-minded, or couldn't make decisions for her own self. She was, in her own way, extremely capable. She planned, and researched, every trip she needed to make. She was shy, at first, but really struck out on her own a lot. Plus, while this is fiction, I know that many colleges struggle with being ADA-compliant. Even if they are, to some degree compliant, there are parts of a campus that can't be accessed by wheelchairs, and yet, Corey broke through those boundaries time and again--she shattered her own emotional boundaries alongside. 
 Yes, she adores Hartley. Who wouldn't? He's funny and kind and loyal, and his precious Stacia is...not. She's an ice princess, off enjoying all that Europe has to offer, including the men. It baffles Corey how Hartley can tolerate it, especially as stoically as he does. He isn't naive, he's just got different priorities--growing up the poor, unknown, bastard child of a trust-fund brat will do that to you, I suppose. He's a bit starry eyed over Stacia's immense wealth. 
 Things evolve between Corey and Hartley in the space of a semester. Their comfortable friendship becomes more fraught. This is only complicated by Stacia's return just before term's end. 
 I'm not gonna lie, this was a thinking book. I had a lot of information about disability--and ability --to absorb, and yet, it was easy. Though Corey complains that she's a whiner, I didn't feel that way about her when reading her POV. Her desire to be seen as a person of value, and a whole person--not just a wheelchair-bond ""problem""--was endearing. As Hartley soon learned, Corey, who was honest and real, was so much easier to love than his airbrushed, waxed/dyed, high maintenance Stacia. But not only was it easy to love Corey, it was easy to respect her, to treasure her, to have real and meaningful conversations with her. 
 The end of this book left me wanting to know more about Corey and Hartley, which is always a great indicator for me. It's the first book in a series, but each book is about a different hockey player at Harkness, so we only get snippets of the other books' characters going forward.",Thu May 14 10:13:10 -0700 2015,Thu May 14 16:42:37 -0700 2015,Thu May 14 16:42:37 -0700 2015,,1,0

 Theos is a Sacrati, the fiercest of warriors in the Torian army. Torian society is communal--the men fight and conquer new lands, and protect the women and children who live within sheltered cities in a collection of valleys in this world. Men and women do not marry in Torian society, they meet rarely for procreation, but otherwise are separate. The prized warriors, like Theos, have many invitations to copulate with women, to produce offspring, but most of the time, the men are game to take care of their sexual needs with their comrades (as do the women!). 
 As a sacrati, Theos is above a lot of the menial army business. His warlord, however, has been acting mighty shady. Under Theos' command, a band of Elkati men are captured well within the Torian borde. It is clear they were attempting to return to neighboring Elkat valley, but Theos knows the value of a good captive--his men will all get a cut for selling them as slaves. And, Theos has the right, as commander, to choose a slave of his own from the captured. Not that he plans to, however. Keeping a slave is expensive and he would do better to claim the slave's selling price for himself. 
 Only, it doesn't go that way. The leader of the Elkati, a fair man called Finnvid, is a healer and a scholar. Theos is especially wary of the strange way his warlord watches Finnvid, and desires him. His suspicions are further augmented when the warlord is enraged by Theos' decision to keep Finnvid, rather than let him be transported through a mountain pass for sale at the onset of winter. Finnvid is not like the men Theos knows. He is verbally opposed to the idea of men having sex with each other--in Elkat such a thing is despised. Moreover, Elkati have monogamous marriages, and this seemingly random copulation within Torian society is as foreign to him as Chinese is to me. It turn out that Theos has 46 children, with more than a dozen women in the city--and more on the way. Finnvid = Mind Blown. 
 Still, Finnvid is a secret keeper of the highest order, and the most significant is his BROTHER is the Elkati King. Returning him to Elkat is imperative, but there are so many secrets and lies, that the politics is nearly as dangerous as the winter mountain passage. 
 There are double crosses, and double standards and murder most foul. Throughout, Finnvid must come to terms with the most hated part of himself--the part that desires men sexually, and Theos in particular. I was fully engaged in this fantastic world. I felt like I was taking icy steps through the snowy mountains, or sweating in the ice huts and soaping up in the bath house. All the secondary characters are beautifully detailed, having real experiences that impact the story. The political machinations were fascinating, and I really found myself drawn into the story--hoping that Finnvid and Theos would find themselves alive, and together, when the final page came. 
 While this is not a traditional romance, and not even a traditional 'slave' romance, there is a constant expectation that Finnvid and Theos will work things out between them. In the meantime, I was rather relieved with how decent Theos was--he had no dearth of sex partners, and he never forced Finnvid to become one of them. They spend a significant amount of time together, and the rapport that develops is quite natural feeling, as are the experiences of regret and loss when they are separated. Still, I had to laugh at how stubborn they both were. 
 The book ended in such a way that I don't anticipate a sequel, but man! I'd like to see how all change in Torian society shakes out...

 Coco and Nick fell in love back in college. They struggled in their relationship, mostly because Nick had a loose definition of the word honesty But they continued to reconnect. Except the last time when they jetted off to Vegas, had a quickie wedding and Coco woke to find Nick's ring and a note on her nightstand in the honeymoon suite. Coco was devastated and her parents arranged an annulment. That was seven years ago and Coco still has a crushed spirit regarding Nick, who is a celebrity chef with a renown restaurant not far from where Coco lives in downtown Detroit. 
 Now, Coco is working with her BFF Mia at their events planning business and her demanding client is adamant that Coco get Nick to help cater her engagement party. Caught between her broken heart and the commission she needs for a down payment on her dream house, Coco bites the bullet and contacts Nick. He's as suave as she remembers, unfortunately, and is happy to help with the party...if Coco will spend a weekend with him. 
 Impetuous as ever, Coco agrees, thinking that setting some ground rules will keep everything professional. Then, she practically jumps him. Her muddled feelings are all the more potent when Nick admits he's loved her all this time, and explains how shattered he was to leave her-how he never intended her to give up her education, which is what she planned the second they said, ""I do."" 
 The weekend is fraught with hot and cold-hot sex, heated discussions, and cold remorse over years wasted. Nick is never more clear about his desires. As a kid he was intimidated by Coco's family's wealth and never felt good enough, but now he's successful and able to be a good provider, if only Coco will give him a chance. 
 Spoiler: she does. 
 Spoiler: he kinda messes up again. 
 Spoiler: they live HEA anyway. 
 This book isn't as straight-out sexyfun as FRENCHED, because it's a reconnection tale. The water never passed under Coco and Nick's bridge, despite seven years going by. While they are still overwhelmingly attracted to each other, they have a lot of work to do if they want this relationship spark to blaze. Nick seems all in from the start. I admired his tenacity. Coco is a bit flighty, but I could totally relate to her misgivings over Nick. As she remarked: What fool takes a second bite from a bad apple? 
 I was glad she took that bite, and I know she was, too. For an erotic romance, there was definitely a good balance between heat and heart. Looking forward to the final book in this series!",Wed May 13 18:09:22 -0700 2015,Wed May 13 18:10:37 -0700 2015,Wed May 13 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,1,0

 Excellent conclusion to the series! 
 Tate and Logan have really connected and are trying to build a life together. Tate's family has disowned him, but he's come to terms with it. Having a satisfying love life is far more appealing than satisfying his family, in Tate's mind. Besides Logan's friends and family adore him. And, Logan adores him--wants Tate to move in. Wants them to be exclusive, and get tested and go bareback. Yep. 
 Tate is reluctant about the moving in. He's a proud man who has worked hard for his place in the world, but he'll never match financially with Logan. Tate's dream is to open his own restaurant and bar, but for now he's still a bartender and this is too humbling of a position for him to consider completely partnering with Logan. But, he's now willing to be out publicly, and their first big challenge is a company dinner at which Tate will meet Logan's ex. 
 There are many challenges faced here, including a medical challenge that sends Logan reeling, which ""reunites"" Tate with his family while simultaneously fracturing his family even further. Without spoiling the book, I'm going to say I admired Tate's dad after reading the book. He did some crap things in TAKE, but he redeemed himself here. I will also say that I hope he does get a better family experience without all the bigotry. Families are not perfect, and the relationships here seemed realistically imperfect. 
 One thing I admired about the story was that it did not require Tate or Logan to propose. Both man are very wary of marriage--and their agreements and partnership seem more than suitable for this committed couple. I also felt satisfied with the actions of Tate's soon-to-be-ex-wife, Diana. She had the opportunity to be truly horrible, and wasn't. This is a pleasant change from the two previous books in the series. It allowed me to think her earlier behavior was mostly a shock-effect---after finding Tate and Logan kissing way back in TRY. Now, having months to digest Tate's sexuality and also to see Logan's devotion, well, she made far better decisions. 
 Again, this is an EROTIC romance, so expect copious copulation and tremendous tittilation. Keep some ice handy to ensure your eReader doesn't melt. I think even sailors reading this one might start substituting ""fudge"" for all the f-bombs about 2/3s in, but I'm quite used to Logan and Tate and their filthy, filthy mouths by now.

 We left the last book with Tate outed to his conservative Catholic family and he and Logan discovering how to move forward with their budding romance. Tate had never had a sexual experience with a man, before meeting Logan. Now, he is beginning to understand how he feels about his sexuality, and how satisfied he is with Logan as a partner. He does not particularly find other men attractive, though this is evolving. 
 The big crisis of the book is dealing with Tate's homophobic family. It does not go well. In fact, introducing his family to Logan goes spectacularly bad. On the outs, Tate requests some time apart--which drives Logan insane. (Short trip!!) still, during their week apart, Tate learns that his appreciation for attractive women is not attraction, and he really wants to make a go of things with Logan. Meanwhile, Logan learns that Tate is a good and honest man, someone to whom Logan can finally cleave, unlike his previous relations with others. The book ends with a minor cliffy, but nothing to get bunched up over. 
 We do get a fair amount of content between Logan and his half-brother Cole. The family dynamics between Logan's ""family"" and Tate's are quite different, and it was really cool seeing their relationship so accepted by their peers. 
 There is a lot of heartfelt conversation in this book, more so than in the first one. These men are trying to build a relationship, instead of simply taking sexual pleasure. In that regard, the book names are a little mixed-up, IMHO. It's absolutely smoking hot, and filled with more sex than a gay bar's bathroom.

 Lyric learned the biggest secret of her life three years ago: her mother isn't human. She is one of several ocean-dwelling races (a daughter of Sirena) who sent 20 operatives into the human world to learn about life on the surface. Her mother, Summer, met her (human) father and they married, had Lyric, and enjoyed a rather normal daily life as low-income people living in Coney Island. Lyric's father is an upstanding police officer, and had been able to mask his wife's lack of documentation over the years. Lyric had no reason to suspect anything was unusual about her heritage until the night the Alpha arrived. 
 The Alpha are Summer's kin, and there's 30,000 of them quarantined in a shanty town on the beach at Coney Island. Lyric's entire neighborhood, now dubbed ""The Zone"", has been placed on lock-down to keep the Alpha from branching out. This means Summer cannot leave Coney Island either as she has no birth certificate or social security card. The book opens with the forced integration of Lyric's high school. 
 Lyric knows she needs to keep her head down at school and in public. All of Summer's associates, the other 19 operatives and their families, have been ""disappeared"" to secret government labs for testing, and calling their house into scrutiny could lead to Lyric and her parents being captured. Summer spends her days and nights searching the video feeds of the refugees to find her parents so they can reunite, if possible. 
 The forced integration is intense and harkens back to the 60s and 70s inclusion of Blacks into ""white"" schools. Expect riots. Lyric and her BFF Bex are hard-pressed to make their way into school without being caught in the mobs. Plus, lots of kids in this impoverished school are more than happy to lash out at the Alpha, but Summer has told Lyric how deadly they can be. The bullying is extreme and fights are sure to have lethal consequences. Trying to stop one such altercation, Lyric finds herself square in the new principal's spotlight, only Principal Doyle isn't just the new guy in charge. It seems he's got serious insider info regarding Lyric's family. They strike a ""deal"" that Lyric acts as a tutor to the Alpha prime's son, Prince Fathom, and Doyle won't 'out' Summer's Alpha status. 
 Thing is, humans seen as sympathetic to, or in the company of, Alpha have been killed by local anti-Alpha vigilantes. The chance of discovery gets ever higher as Prince Fathom and Lyric spend more time together--causing Doyle to sweeten his offer: he has bona fide paperwork for Summer that will enable her family to leave The Zone. 
 There is a love spark here, between Lyric and Prince Fathom, but it's on the down low for the first half of the book. I think the bigger part of the story is the politicization of this refugee community. The governer of NY (a blatant parody of Michelle Bachmann which I appreciated) is a hardline conservative positioned against integration, and is on the school steps attempting to bodily block Alpha entry--the National Guard is out in full force, and present in the school and classrooms. Vigilantes are everywhere, attempting to incite riot. 
 There are so many parallels to today's society in this novel one could discuss the themes in the context of racism, classism, undocumented status, homophobia, vigilante justice, and xenophobia, among others. The plot itself is not terribly original--Lyric must overcome her own issues and fight the spreading violence that is overtaking The Zone to save herself and her family. The characterization is unique, however, and the love interest thing is not the major focus. Sure, Lyric develops an affection for Fathom, and it's reciprocated, but there are a million and one other things happening here, and that's absolutely cool. 
 I really dug the action, and the world-building within this tiny slice of Americana. I've been to Coney Island, and could easily imagine the devastation of the community around it, all filtered through Lyric's eyes. The Alpha are an amazing collection of beings, each of which has a specific role within their society. Learning that they are not the biggest problem facing humanity is rather a refreshing twist. Lyric's migraines are a part of who she is, and the benefit of them was only revealed late. She's able to channel some of that physiological malady into powering an Alpha weapon, but killing others may be beyond Lyric's pacifist ideals. Well, until her existence is treatened... The short time-frame for mastery was thin on believability, but I was able to overcome it. I loved the gritty descriptions, and the secondary characters are fantastic--from Bex's miserable abusive step-father to Lyric's nosy racist neighbor. 
 The book ends with a temporary end to hostilites, though the resolution is not complete. Lyric has a lot more work to do to fix her family and her world. This is series I know my kids will love, and I'm anxious for the sequel.

 Ray is an androgynous person living in Ellery, VT. Ray suffers depression and has had many clashes with the parental-type figures and is facing eviction from the current residence: a basement apartment in Ray's ex-stepfather Tom's home. Ray works at a local greasy spoon and craves the connections with co-workers as much as the tips. 
 Ray's actual parents are multimillionaire dysfunctional people, and Ray has incurred their wrath by dropping out of college and refusing their money. Ray truly loves only one person: Davey, a pseudo step-brother (Davey is 11 y/o and the child of Tom, and the woman he married after Ray's mother and Tom divorced) and Tom is not willing to trust Davey in Ray's care due to Ray's floundering and (potential) alcohol problem. Also, Tom's not fond of Ray's androgyny--but wrecking Tom's new Mercedes while on a booze-and-pizza run is the last straw, and Ray is pretty much homeless. 
 While working one late night, Ray is verbally assaulted by a drunk customer. Wyatt, on of the tablemates of the loudmouth forces and apology, and strikes up a connection with Ray over the course of a couple visits back to the diner. Turns out Wyatt's a frat-boy in Ray's dad's former house--and this is particularly problematic. Daddy Dearest has some very strong (negative) opinions about Ray--and is positioned to make Ray's crap life even crappier. Despite Ray's mental/emotional issues, there is an undeniable physical interest in Wyatt. This is new; Ray hasn't had an interest in anyone since the Big Break Up more than a year ago. Feeling brave, and emboldened by Wyatt's interest, Ray responds to Wyatt's overtures. Sort of. 
 This book is very well-written. Part of the plot, however, absolutely depends upon Ray's androgyny and the question of which equipment lays beneath the zipper of Ray's signature black stovepipe jeans. I'm not going to spoil this, because it would destroy the reading experience, but I will say there is a good amount of misdirection. I loved Wyatt. He is a great character, and a fitting mate to Ray. The lengths to which Wyatt extends himself to keep Ray off the streets is admirable. Plus, Wyatt's always looking to get Davey and Ray together for brief visits, even if Tom doesn't allow this. Oh, did I mention that Tom is Wyatt's academic advisor? Yeah. Wyatt puts his college career on the line to keep Ray and Davey connected. The romance, as it develops, is tender and, eventually, passionate. 
 Of course, Ray has a LOT of secrets, some of which cause a rift between Ray and Wyatt. Also, the androgyny thing creates tension for other guys in Wyatt's frat. Some of the dudes dig it TOO much, while others are freaked the EFF out. Expect sexual harassment and homophobia. One brother, in particular, isn't in favor of Wyatt's attempts to make their frat ""more inclusive"" which sparks off a big altercation that leaves Ray in jeopardy. I enjoyed how this situation got resolved. It allowed Ray and Tom to solve problems in their relationship, and also gave Ray clarity about Wyatt. The resolution of the story is satisfying. There's some sexytimes, but those are pretty down-low; the first of which doesn't specifically reveal Ray's gender, so the reader is kept in suspense for several more chapters on that front.

At 25 years old and still a bachelor, his fiercely religious mother is impatient for grandkids, and always willing to make her desire known. Billy is a hard-working man; always has been. He's qualified to be a licensed contractor but suffers test-taking anxiety after years of ridicule in school. He'd been a late bloomer in terms of reading, though now he's fully literate and supporting himself--and, to some degree, his parents ever since his father's debilitating heart attack years ago. Billy dropped out of school and worked to help pay the mortgage and his younger sister's college tuition--and his sacrifices have not gone unnoticed. 
 In prep for the big wedding of his sister to a hoity-toity rich guy, Billy allows himself to be talked into working with his sister's stylist, Shazam, so that he'll be fashionable for all the wedding events. Still questioning what keeps going wrong with his relationships, Billy is stunned to find Shaz, the effeminate redhead, strangely appealing. Billy has only been sexually active with a man once--if you consider paying a trick for some oral distraction ""active""--and he is freaked out. 
 Shaz is more than a little attracted to his straight client. Dressing such a big, burly man--one who had interfered in a possible bashing of himself--is a fun challenge, and Shaz is determined to make friends with Billy, if only to spend more time with him. Thing is, the more time they spend, the greater the attraction simmers between them. 
 Okay, so there are a lot of issues at play in this story. Homophobic crew on Billy's worksites, homophobic parents on the little league team Billy coaches, homophobic mother...casual homophobia and direct homophobia. Cheating partners and supportive friends. Men finding their way independently both sexually and financially, and that doesn't only mean Billy, or even Shaz. There are great secondary characters here who round out the narrative. 
 While Billy begins to sort out his complicated feelings about possibly being gay, Shaz is sorting out the mess of being a partner to a closet case, or having the important people in Billy's life hate both of them. The so-called 'you turned him gay' backlash is not Shaz's cup of Darjeeling. A wealthy potential business partner swoops into Shaz's life and Billy quadruple guesses what the heck a sexy, suave sophisticated man like Shaz could see in a rough, barely literate high school drop out like himself. A lot of time is spent with these two men having strong feelings for one another, and yet staying separate, working on their lives with an eye to figure out how to restart what they had barely initiated. Which only makes it sweeter when Billy rides in to the rescue. Because he does. 
 At his core, Billy is as decent a person as anyone could hope to know. He volunteers for little league coaching, he works two and three jobs to have money to support his family, he has two gay cats which (I'm sure even though the book didn't say) were shelter rescues. He doesn't sleep around and he apologizes for cursing in front of his mother. The man is a freaking saint, and thinks he's dirt because he did poorly in school. If Shaz didn't climb him like a tree, several times, I would have attempted it myself. 
 Shaz is, himself, a good egg. He works hard and values hard work. The socialite playboys he always finds himself aligned with are too narcissistic and have no sense of honor, but Shaz sees real honor and valor, even, in Billy. The more Billy embraces his sexuality, the more astounded Shaz is by his courage. 
 This is a well-crafted Gay-For-You romance that embraces the idea of slow changes and coming to terms with one's self before coming out. Shaz, having been shunned by his own family, never pressures Billy to make bold moves. On the contrary, he assures Billy he cares for him exactly as he is, and will stand wherever he needs to to keep Billy within a comfort zone. Even after becoming physical, the end is far into the future, with major hurdles for Billy to overcome. I was so glad that he had Shaz beside him for most of it. The sexytimes are fun and flirty as well as being sexy-sexy. I just enjoyed the book so much.",Wed Apr 29 08:06:25 -0700 2015,Fri May 01 03:40:27 -0700 2015,Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,6,0

 I'll admit to a bit of trepidation regarding this third installment of the Moments In Time series. I adored the first book. Loving Collin's first foray into a relationship with *gasp* his roommate, Tanner, a bisexual. The Gay hate from his family when his mother learned was rough, but not as rough as the lack of communication in book two which almost broke Collin and Tanner up for good. 
 Still, reading the blurb on book three and knowing I was walking into more coming out drama and possibly a love triangle with a weepy Wendy wishing Tanner would choose her, again, plus Collin's brother struggling to keep custody of his kids against his homophobic ex....well, I was mighty trepidatious. 
 Silly me! 
 This book is a whole lot of YES! though this is mostly at the end... 
 Return to college is problematic thanks to a dorm ""fire"" that dislocates Collin and Tanner from their private room into a gymnasium with fifty other students. Moving in with Collin's brother and his three kids is a better option, until his adulterous ex pitches a fit on ""moral"" grounds. Leaning on Wendy is a bad option--she is still angry that they didn't tell her what a sleazeball her boyfriend was over the summer, and she's not quite sure letting Tanner go was the best choice. In that she has a partner: Collin. 
 Yeah, see, Tanner and Collin get outed on campus, and the homophobic backlash is suffocating their relationship. They do get some assistance, but Collin's sure Tanner can have a normal life if only he wasn't tied down to a dude. Bisexuals can love either sex, right? Saint Collin makes some heavy-handed decisions which end up being mostly a train wreck of epic missteps and lead to an HEA that is tender and honest. Plus, his cry for help actually makes life easier for everyone. Who knew? 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this end to the series, and the whole set. The three novellas are filled with fast-paced plots, deep feels and some seriously smokin' sexytimes.

 Ark and JD are two men who collect public sex acts on tape for porn websites. They have been business partners for four years, having met the first night Ark stepped off a bus in Denver and rescued JD from a 4-on-1 beat down. JD is the star of the public sex tapes, and they recruit only legal, disease free women to perform. Ark is a master videographer and runs all the logistics of their operation. They have made millions of dollars in porn over the past four years, but it hasn't been easy. JD has a dark past which includes a (recovered) drug addiction, a dead girlfriend and a missing daughter. They are weeks away from the culmination of their plan to open their own porn website when they meet a half-naked, shivering woman sitting in the rain on an early October morning. 
 Unable to score their required quota of public sex tapes for the week, JD attempts to cajole the woman into starring in their movie--she clearly needs cash--and she accepts. But, it's raining and she's freezing and looks strung out. They end up taking her to their penthouse around the corner, and that's when Ark knows his life is about to change. 
 The woman, who they call Blue on account of her blue eyes, has been through extreme trauma--her body bears the welts and scars of beating--tell-tale scars of BDSM/rough trade sex play. When she becomes cognizant she confesses running away from a cult which had kept her as a captive sex slave for the past 15 months. Blue had been attempting to help her childhood friend escape from an baby-selling ring but got sucked into it, instead. She is broken and unwilling to attempt to return to her past life, afraid to embarrass her high-profile parents. Ark agrees to give her sanctuary in the condo he and JD share, but the attraction between them is magnetic. JD has no compunction about his interest, but Blue wants more than JD, she wants Ark, too, and Ark's not down for a menage. At first. Ark is more than interested in Blue, but he's not a ""sharer"" and he's seen JD in action with women--he's rough which is not Ark's style even if it plays well in porn. Blue's extreme agorophobia is unsettling, and the brand on her neck sends JD into a dark headspace--his girlfriend was branded just the same way, and their baby stolen, sold to adoptive parents. The questions about Blue's history begin to be revealed, and mutual connections in the porn industry start answering JD's long-desired inquests regarding the whereabouts of his daughter. 
 As the time winds, Blue and JD are able to entice Ark into committing to a menage. Ark is, himself, always slightly removed from the emotional aspect, and he fears that JD will hurt Blue--he's seen it before. JD enjoys very rough sex, and Blue's emotionally frail. But the shoe really drops when Ark arrives home to find some very abusive kink happening in his absence. 
 The mystery of JD's guilty past, Blue's quest for justice and Ark's absent history all resolve in the final 10% of the book. It's a carefully revealed mystery, with plenty of misdirection. There is a lot of sex, but little of it felt erotic. I think this was because scenes told from Ark's POV were lacking emotionally, which was in line with his character. He was obsessive and controlling and holding too many secrets (of his own and JD's) to allow for a full connection between himself, JD and Blue for a very long time. That isn't a criticism. I enjoyed the way the characters interacted, and how the subtle foreshadowing built up to a seriously good payoff. This is a book that keeps the reader guessing, and waiting, and knowing that something REALLY REALLY bad is coming and hoping that it will all just work out. 
 Spoiler: it doesn't. Not exactly. 
 There is a positive resolution where the baddies are brought to justice, and the guilty are punished, but it's not a sunny, hearts and flowers ending. The intrigue and twistedness of the characters is fascinating, however. And though the end isn't sunshine and rainbows, it's honest and real and good.

 Josh and Caleb are young men (barely 20 y/o) born into a polygamist cult in rural Wyoming. They have spent nearly every day of their lives together, and Josh has always desired Caleb, but knew his desires were sinful and unfitting their religious teaching. Plus, Josh is a ""throw away"" kid, one who is good for maybe a decade of labor in the cult farms, but he has no special skills and his parents have no influence, so he won't ever become an elder eligible for marriage--not that he wants one wife, or *shudder* more. 
 It's pretty quick into the book when Josh realizes he's been targeted for expulsion. Caleb, first grandson to a prominent elder, is savvy to the process and warns Josh, setting up a rendezvous. Caleb arrives at the meet-up just in time to help Josh when he really needs it, but Josh is bereft, and distraught that Caleb fled their Compound to help him. These two seek help, and find it in the form of a long-haul trucker who is willing to take a chance transporting them near to Massachusetts where a cult runaway, Maggie, has set up a safehouse. 
 Along the way, Josh is astonished to learn that Caleb wasn't willing to let Josh go alone, because, well...Caleb loves him. Has since, forever. He never wanted a wife, even though he would have been granted two or three on account of his status. While Josh and Caleb begin to connect on their travels, they know they can't be open about their homosexuality with Maggie and her husband, Dylan. 
 Caleb is able to find work rather quickly. Unlike Josh, he was issued a birth certificate, SSN and driver's license. Josh, having to wait to get official documentation, can't really work, so he helps around Dylan and Maggie's dairy farm, and learns to do the domestic work (cooking, cleaning laundry) that men in the cult would never have done. It's a culture shock for Josh and Caleb to observe Maggie sassing Dylan and not be beat for impertinence. When Maggie gives birth to a colicky baby girl, Josh is eager to step in and help, singing and coddling the baby. 
 As time goes on, Josh and Caleb struggle to stay closeted, afraid to lose their home if Maggie or Dylan objects. Plus, there's the advent of depression, and another cult runaway, and Caleb being a dingbat, and twue wuv. 
 I liked the story. It's well-written and a good comfort read with a progressively more positive plot. There wasn't a LOT of conflict, and Josh and Caleb are really rather adorable. I liked the sexy times, and their journey--from cult to couple--was interesting. They tell the story in alternate POV, and I have to say I liked Josh's viewpoint more. Mostly because Josh is the tenderest soul in Tender Town...",Mon Apr 20 14:15:01 -0700 2015,Mon Apr 20 14:52:29 -0700 2015,Sat Apr 18 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,3,0

The Santuarians inhabit an arid island, Santuario, in the South Sea. The Skanians have a government, and adequate living conditions, the Santuarians...not so much. 
 A dead body is discovered on the Santario shore, and Teniente (Officer) Alex Rukow of the Policia is given the assignment to investigate. His report brings out Bengt, a Skanian investigator, from the mainland. Alex is fighting to stay under the radar of the local military--the Securitas--who, despite the name, only maintain the security of the powerful familias on Santuario. Luis, leader of the local Securitas is Alex's biological father, though Alex maintains as great a distance as he can--to avoid beat downs. 
 Bengt is not only overwhelmed by the heat on Santuario, but the culture is not at all what he excepted. Skanians thrive on connection and order, and everywhere he goes, he sees poverty and desolation. Alex, his guide, is nothing but a close-mouthed valet--at first. As Bengt watches the interactions, and witnesses the fallout of Alex crossing Securitas dictates, Bengt learns that working covertly is really the only option if Alex plans to stay alive. 
 Unfortunately, the first body found is not the last, and both Alex and Bengt are drawn into a growing political movement against the despotic familias of Santuario. Alex, himself, is frustrated--not only by his case, but by the strange connection he feels developing between himself and Bengt. Gay is nothing good to be in Santuario, even if Bengt notes that he not only is gay, but is proudly gay in Jarovegur where sexuality is not an issue at all. 
 Expect cultural miscommunication, tense lines of communication, beatings, killings, and attempted murder of a Teniente. The resolution to the case was well described, and Alex and Bengt come to more than an agreement regarding their connection. The book ends with a resolution, but it's more HFN than HEA. I enjoyed the world-building here, and felt I was able to get invested due to my own Spanish education, but for people who know no Spanish this may be a tougher read. 
 Not much heat here. Okay, Santuario the place is sweltering, but Santuario the book is more a sex-behind-closed-doors read. The big scene comes very late and had only minimal physical descriptions. I wanted to ""see"" Bengt give Alex a good ride... ;)

 Owen and Nathan went to Uni together and had mutual friends but were never close. Owen, out and loving it, had a crush on (supposedly) straight Nathan, but never toyed with Nathan because why bother? Plenty of gay mates were available. That was then. 
 Now, Nathan has returned to Bristol and is out with Owen and his good friends, Simon and Jack, who are a committed couple. Owen decides to risk hitting on Nathan, having just learned Nathan is gay. Well, Nathan may find Owen sexy, but he's not up for a one night stand. 
 No, if Owen wants to be with Nathan, he needs to work for it. Owen's thrown off by Nathan's insistence on not one, but FIVE sex-free dates. Try as he might, Owen can't remember ever going on a single date with a bloke. (He is, admittedly, a tart.) But there's something in this challenge that strikes a chord with Owen and he agrees. 
 They set up their dates for Saturdays, and over the course of the first few weeks develop a rapport. Calls, texts, and of course their shared time on the dates pull both Nathan and Owen in closer than either had imagined. Their make-outs resulting in aborted physicality ups the stakes, too. Funny how quickly they take to phone sex! 
 Ok, this is really a sweet read with two men who find a connection they didn't anticipate. Nathan didn't want to be a conquest, and Owen couldn't imagine finding a boyfriend. It was a rewarding short read with plenty of titillating moments and a couple hot scenes. The two POV narrative worked for me because I was able to find both men charmingly vulnerable and hoped that they'd decide that five dates just wasn't enough...

She strives to be a model teen, getting involved in activities and keeping good grades. She's been abused and placed in foster care before and never wants to return. Her tiny Illinois farm town is a tight community, and Sage has fit in by being the sidekick/best friend of Ryan, a gangly boy who is just beginning to pull off the 'hipster' look he's adopted. They've been inseparable besties for the past three years, and Sage often wonders why Ryan isn't interested romantically...still Sage looks on the bright side, always, and performs daily acts of kindness--like leaving post-it note affirmations on the lockers of kids when she sees they are having bad times. 
 A new guy moves into town, Shane Cavendish, and his worn clothes and general scruffiness are catnip to the bullies, headed by star athlete Dylan. Sage can't bear to see this kid shoved around, and decides to step in. For his part, Shane wants nothing to do with anyone. He's stunned that anyone takes any interest in him at all, and Sage's interest is really intense. She can see that he's had a rough life, perhaps rivaling her own, and wants to help, to show him that he is not alone. 
 They develop a tenuous friendship, which puts Ryan into Protector mode, but, beyond that, Sage starts to see the secrets behind her friendships, and Ryan's got some big-time explaining. Not that Sage is an open book. No, her shiny veneer hides a darkness that shouldn't see the light of a high school hallway. Unfortunately, she makes an enemy of Dylan who threatens to ruin her for her interference. 
 Thing is, the more Dylan threatens, the more friends Sage makes, and her acts of kindness do not go unnoticed. Plus, for the first time ever, it seems that a boy she likes actually reciprocates. Shane is in need of connection, and Sage is a force to be reckoned with in that regard. He is drawn into her knot of friendships and they explore dating in a quiet way, much to Ryan's chagrin. 
 I did enjoy the slow reveal of Sage's backstory. I adored her 'do-goodiness;' how she searched daily for someone she could cheer up with a kind note. I loved her relationship with her aunt, and how she refused to ride in a car because her dad died in a wreck. She is strong, and principled, and kind. She isn't nasty or mean, but can be fierce when pushed. 
 Shane is....*shakes head* *sighs* such a GREAT love interest. He is kind and compassionate and loving and all the things that Sage deserves. And she works very hard to get him, and to keep him, even when it means revealing more about herself than she ever planned to do. 
 This is an age-appropriate teen read with humor, heart and a relentless force for good leading the charge against bullies, pollution and neglect.

 Jeremy Rixey is the owner of Hard Ink, a tattoo parlor, and base of operations for his brother Nick's special ops team who are trying to clear their names following dishonorable discharge after an op in Afghanistan went really bad. The first three books in this series focus on the romances and intrigue of Nick and two of his fellow veterans. While falling in love, with unlikely women, they have spent a lot of time learning more about the guys who set them up--one who may have been their commanding officer, Colonel Merritt. In the previous stories they saved Merritt's children Charlie and Becca from drug lords. Charlie is an out gay man, and had little contact with his dad--who disowned him years ago. 
 Now Charlie, a computer programmer, works the tech side of this covert investigation. He just recently learned that his dad wasn't committing treason, but he suffered a lot in his captivity, including the loss of a two fingers. He's attracted to Jeremy, who is bisexual, but doesn't really feel worthy of love. Plus, he's not sure that ultra cool Jeremy--who he idolizes--would love a computer geek. 
 These two have spent weeks living in the close quarters of the Hard Ink compound, and Jeremy has definitely been interested in Charlie, not that they've had a lot of downtime for romance. In fact, this book doesn't have a lot of downtime for romance. It spans only a couple of days, and they are fraught with confrontations. And sex. There is a bit of tenderness, and we get to see Jeremy in action as a tattoo artist, as well as a lover. Charlie is, oddly, not as innocent as he seemed, and I wondered where all his experience came from--as he's admitted to being very sheltered.... 
 I liked the book, but I wished there had been a bit more buildup of the relationship. It all goes too fast, and I wondered if that was because it was expected that some of the Hard Ink readership isn't keen on M/M romance, so the plan was to keep this installment quick and dirty, leaving the next book to pick up more of the intrigue with a het romance. I think JR Ward did well blending a gay romance into her BDB series, and I was looking for the same experience here from Laura Kaye. I was glad that free-spirited Jeremy and shy Charlie got their time to shine, I only wished for more. I hope this book does well enough that we continue to see these men in future Hard Ink books.",Tue Apr 07 08:47:54 -0700 2015,Mon Apr 13 18:19:39 -0700 2015,Thu Apr 02 00:00:00 -0700 2015,,2,0

 4.5 for this contemporary YA gay story with elements of romance. 
 I don't count this book as a romance, though there is a lot of romantic elements, because the objective of a romance is different from this book's objectives. This is a survivor story, one which is raw, and gripping and will rip your freaking heart through your knotted throat. It will leave you feeling emotionally battered, and sad, and enriched for spending your time in the lives of Kevin and Rick. 
 These two meet at school after Rick's family has relocated to Salt Lake City following the death of Rick's older brother, the second death Rick blames on himself. Rick is the pariah in his family, barely tolerated by his father and stepmother, though his half-sister Emma adores him. Rick is depressed, and friendless, when Kevin selects him to join his group. 
 Kevin lives a double life; he turns tricks for booze and drugs and is very active in the gay clubbing community, but he's 17 and has created the perfect facade for his father's sadistic abuse. He sees Rick as a challenge, and enjoys manipulating people to escape his own silent misery. 
 In the course of getting Rick to be his newest groupie, Kevin learns that Rick's father has just begun physically abusing him. They share this secret unwillingly, but when Rick finds out about Kevin's own abuse, Kevin can't deal. And, his true attraction for Rick seeps out in the aftermath. 
 Kevin's attempts to seal Rick's fate by pursuing him sexually, but neither boy expects to experience such an emotional engagement. 
 Expect graphic violence against teens and explicit drug and alcohol use. Do not expect graphic sex, because this is an emotions book, with all sex (even hetero) happening just off the page. 
 Expect to be emotionally wrecked at the end, which I will not spoil. I will say that it is as in character with the dark themes of this book as all the rest of the 200+ pages were. And, while I'm a sucker for an HEA, or even an HFN, ending, this story never promised a happy ending. I don't even know if I could have read one here and not felt it was a bit trite. (I still would have LIKED it, but that's the Pollyanna in me.) 
 Kevin's is right, nobody wants to believe a monster lives right next door. The writing is taut and the characters intense. I hated Rick and Kevin's dads, and I even wanted to knock Rick's stepmother out. There was too little love here, but sometimes that's exactly true in this world.",Mon Apr 06 12:19:02 -0700 2015,Mon Apr 06 12:19:48 -0700 2015,Mon Apr 06 16:26:48 -0700 2015,,2,0

I know not everyone cares for gay fiction, but this book is phenomenal, and should be read by anyone who knows a person with depression, or autism. Or anyone who has heard of a person having depression or autism. Or anyone who has no idea what in the Sam Hill depression or autism are. You there, the guy with the hat! Yes, you! YOU should read this book! 
 Seriously. 
 Because this book is about humanity, and being a whole human even if your humanity is complicated by depression or autism. 
 Here's why: for people who are on the outside of these diagnoses, you maybe can't appreciate the person who struggles with them. That is not to say you can't see and notice them, but getting the whole scope of their existence is difficult. Most people only SEE the diagnosis; the tics or flaps of autism, the withdrawn flat affect of a chronic depressive. Emmet and Jeremey are not caricatures of their diagnosis. They are flesh-and-bone young men who have dreams and aspirations of a life, a REAL adult life. And, love. 
 Emmet is a 19 y/o certified genius. He has a highly-functional level of autism that is both amazing (he can count cards and write computer programs) and daunting. He is easily overwhelmed by too many stimuli and has a whole menu of adaptations to keep him from acting out. 
 Add to all of these challenges, Emmet is also gay. He has never had a boyfriend, and was homeschooled most of his life. He moved to Jeremey's neighborhood ten months before, so that he could attend Iowa State Univ. Emmet and Jeremey's properties align in the back, split from each other by a railway line. Because Emmet is fascinated by trains, he spends a lot of time watching his backyard, and that's how he spots Jeremey. 
 It took me ten months to meet Jeremey Sampson. 
 Emmet recognizes his limitations, and starting college and a friendship is too much. He does a little bit of online stalking to discover Jeremey's identity all to one purpose: 
 I wanted to meet him and find out why he was sad. Maybe make him happy. But I couldn't. The truth was, I had a crush on Jeremey Sampson. I didn't want to just be his friend. I wanted to be his BOYfriend. 
 And this is a big problem because, despite being a genius, Emmet's hampered by his diagnosis. 
 I also have autism spectrum disorder. It's not even close to the most important thing about me, but as soon as people see me, watch me move, hear me speak, it's the only thing that seems to matter. People treat me differently. They act as if I'm stupid or dangerous. They call me the R word or tell me I should be put in a home, and they mean an institution, not the house where I live. 
 When people find out I have autism, they don't think I should be allowed to be in love, not with Jeremey, not with anyone. 
 Did anybody feel a truth bomb explode in that passage? *raises hand* 
 Emmet knows the ""people on the mean,"" the ""normals"" don't consider him, an adult autistic person, as more than a half-person, not someone who might have great aspirations to live without being watched, to love a partner without backlash. It is increasingly complicated for Emmet to find a partner, because of his sexuality, but I can imagine this is difficult for any heterosexual autistic person, too. Still, his character is so incredibly brave. He makes all sorts of plans, rehearses his first words, trying to vary his inflections so that he sounds ""normal"" all for the moment that he gets the chance to speak to Jeremey. 
 It took me ten months to introduce myself to Jeremey Sampson. To learn and memorize the etiquette, to find the right words that would show ME to Jeremey, not my autism. It took a long time and a lot of work, but I did it. 
 But this is why I fell for Emmet: he doesn't hate himself. 
 I shouldn't have worried so much about it. Frankly, I'm awesome, and anybody who doesn't agree should get out of my way. 
 I had to agree. 
 Jeremey, is a another animal entirely. 
 When you have an invisible disease, your sickness isn't your biggest problem. What you end up battling more than anything else, every single day, is other people. 
 Jeremey unequivocally suffers severe depression. He is withdrawn and struggles even to get out of bed. He's also prone to panic attacks and clinical anxiety--which mostly happens in public places. He is 18, newly graduated from high school, and his parents (misguidedly) shove him at colleges--a place Jeremey knows he'll never survive. 
 Mom wanted a bright, smiling, charming son....I wasn't the son my mom wanted. 
 His parents, in some sort of denial, will not allow Jeremey to take medication. Meeting Emmet is a shock to his system, in the best way. 
 If Emmet thought I was a tool, he didn't show it. He waited patiently, rocking gently on his heels, staring at the place beside my head. His posture was so odd. His shoulders were too high, and his hands were all twisted in front of him. Sometimes he moved them, but only for a moment, and then he'd go rigid again. 
 He was cute. His hair was light brown and a little long, fanning around his face like he was in a boy band. 
 Emmet's not sure if Jeremey's gay, but he's willing to at least be a friend to Jeremey. They strike up a tenuous communication via text and email which leads to visits. Jeremey's mother is especially critical of Jeremey's association with Emmet, but she recognizes that no other kids want to hang around her son and begrudgingly allows it. Well, until their friendship progresses to something...more. 
 I think Jeremey said it perfectly: 
 People saw us walking down the street to the grocery store or wantdering the aisles of Wheatsfield and acted as if we were escapees from the Island of Adorable, puppies dressed up in people clothes. Like we weren't boyfriends, like we were fake. 
 No wonder I feel alienated. They're the ones telling me I'm not like everyone else. It doesn't matter how normal I am, somebody's ready to tell me I'm different. 
 Nonetheless, Jeremey's mom wasn't happy to learn that her son was gay, and especially not happy to have him ""dating"" an ""R"" word... 
 Cue the meltdown that leads to the next meltdown, that leads to Jeremey in dire straights. Here's the thing: Emmet is a superhero, to me and Jeremey. He makes a plan to get independent, so that he and Jeremey can live together. Emmet recognizes the toxic environment in which Jeremey exists and wants to help him escape it. Not one step of this road is easy, and yet there is no angst; there is only struggle and the drive to overcome. 
 Couple things...whole people have whole lives, and this includes a sex life. Emmet, due to his autism, is an extremely forthright person. He cannot operate in subtlety, yet struggles to make his needs plain in speech. Emmet wants a sexual relationship with Jeremey, and Jeremey reciprocates this desire. I'm not going to belabor this, but it is freaking beautifully, tenderly rendered. Sex happens, and it's on the page, and it's not lewd. It is as honest as every other experience in this book. It probably comprises 0.05% of the text. The rest is a fantastic story about two young men being THEIR normal, and finding love, and plotting their way in a confusing, overwhelming world. 
 I'm glad to have read this book. It changed me in ways that will undoubtedly resonate for decades. I hope it changed me so much that my kids learn to act better to special needs people because they will see me act better to them. (Not that I'm a demeaning person or ever treated an autistic or depressed person in a mean fashion.) I think WE, people on the mean, have unfair ideas in our ""normal"" brains that isolate autistic or depressed people because we see only how different that they are from us without even beginning to question how they are the same. 
 CARRY THE OCEAN is not a challenging read, it simply challenges the reader to see persons with these diagnoses as equal, not other. As human, not diseases. That doesn't mean the book is a downer. On the contrary, the deft writing keeps the story from getting mired in misery. There are definite high points, and a constant sense that the book will have an HEA. The humor is light, and quiet, but present. (Think /facepalm v. LOL!) So many times I found myself smiling and cheering from this side of the screen. If I ever meet Emmet and Jeremey IRL I'm not gonna look at them like puppies in people clothes, I'm going to respect them and their struggle. They would have certainly earned it.

 Tom and his long-time partner, Cass, own five restaurants together. Cass is the head chef and creative force, while Tom minds the business end and helps scout new locations/concepts for their uniquely developed eateries. They have been together 9 years and are in a stable, committed relationship...that is open. See, Tom and Cass work long, long hours and--with schedules like ships passing--don't spent many nights together so they are cool with each finding a bit of companionship when necessary. They have also sometimes shared a lover, but this has been rare. 
 Tom meets Jake one night while scouting a potential new location. Jake is his especially candid waiter whose tics are curious. The meal is a disaster, but Tom and Jake make an impression on each other. Tom isn't even put off by Jake's many tics and outbursts, finding his Tourette's syndrome oddly endearing. Tom takes Jake to his nearby flat for a good time, and Jake wakes the next morning to find Cass offering him a cup of tea. Eep! 
 Okay, so the thing is, Tom is a wealthy guy--has been his whole life. He's what Cass calls a 'fixer'--and Cass should know; Tom loved Cass back from a history of poverty, drugs, theft and incarceration. Cass figures Jake caught Tom's eye not only because he's attractive, but because he could sense Jake's need for a bit of TLC. Cass encourages Tom to find Jake again, and help him if warranted. 
 It's not a conscious search--Tom and Jake encounter each other randomly a few weeks later. Jake is angry, and embarrassed that Tom never mentioned Cass. He doesn't understand Tom and Cass's open relationship, and his attraction to Tom is frustrating. It brings out all the tics. Tom offers Jake a job, but Jake is too proud to accept it. He does offer to do some work for Tom--without pay. So, Tom takes Jake under his wing on his latest restaurant venture. They work well together, though the touchy-feely bits are not happening because Jake doesn't want to get between Tom and Cass. 
 Over the course of a few months Tom, Jake and Cass interact regularly and become very close. There is a lot of relationship building here--not a short seduction moving into a whole lotta three-way sex. Nope. This book is really about relationships and I loved that. Jake is initially attracted to Tom, and feels so guilty about his feelings when he sees the deep love between Tom and Cass, but Cass makes heroic efforts to develop a friendship with Jake. Cass knows he's distant with Tom--he has always felt inadequate to Tom's love--and wants Tom to have a partner who really loves him and who can be around more than Cass. Not that Cass wants to leave-he doesn't--he just wants to know that Tom has a stable lover that can see him more than one or two nights a week. 
 The POV shifts between Tom and Jake for the bulk of the book, though the end is all Cass. It was interesting to get Jake's POV, because he is, quite literally, the man in the middle. Enfolding him in Tom and Cass's relationship is platonic for a good bit of the story, and there are only a few key sex scenes that hit the page. Jake is a very compelling character due to his emotional issues, and how hard he works to have a normal life. He is unsettled by Cass--how can Cass accept him knowing how he feels for Tom?--but comes to depend upon Cass's efforts at friendship. Cass isn't delicate about Jake's TS, he is blunt and Jake appreciates the freedom in talking about this condition that has been a stigma for so long. The love that Tom and Cass lavish on Jake sparks his growth into a more confidant person--and an equal partner in their developing relationship. 
 I really enjoyed how these men worked cooperatively for the benefit of all. A menage story is always susceptible to issues of inadequacy and dominance, but this book felt tender and compassionate. I would have read the whole book in one sitting, but I (foolishly) began it 11:30pm and had to get SOME sleep in that night.

Lindsey is a sympathetic character--the socialite with a social conscience. He's 24, wealthy and lonely. His family is very loving and he's got close friends in the Harker pack--notably Cole Harker--but he wants a life partner. Wolves are very big on mates, and Lindsey is unapologetically flamboyant, which is just not acceptable to his fellow wolves. 
 He'd settle for a human, but, well, rules of the pack state that humans can never know of their existence, plus Lindsey always wishes he could be the rough, dominant animal he hungers to unleash in bed and humans are...fragile. 
 Lindsey's secret isn't only that he's half-werewolf, he's also a vigilante. Super Granny has been policing the streets saving victims of mugging and attempted rape. Now, there's a kidnapping ring that's been ransoming children from Lindsey's country club and Lindsey isn't willing to sit onthe sidelines--not when Super Granny can save the governor's daughter! 
 In the mix of this, Lindsey meets Officer Seth Zakowsky--a rough-and-tumble motorcycle-riding expert on kidnappers. Seth is gay, but not interested in a ""queen""--well, not at first. Lindsey is thoroughly attracted and knows full-well that a butch man like Seth would never accept him, yet Lindsey's throwing of attitude has the opposite effect. Seth sees him as brave and really admires Lindsey's athleticism and kindness. Seth had been raised in lower class life, and Lindsey's wealth is kinda off-putting, but the more time they spend the more Seth sees Lindsey's altruism, and the more he wants that man, despite the neck-kerchiefs and purple Gucci loafers. 
 There's some complications--not the least of which Seth uncovering one of Lindsey's two major secrets--and a rather big kerfuffle. Spoiler: two break-ups here, and both are settled by outside forces. 
 I loved Lindsey, and really enjoyed the pace and action of this book. There are really yummy smexytimes to enjoy. Plus, Cole was a great friend, and the intervention on Lindsey's behalf to create the HEA was Pretty-Woman-ish in impact. Plus, the stage is set for the homophobic issues that come up in the next book, WINTER'S WOLF.",Sat Mar 07 05:37:43 -0800 2015,Sat Mar 07 05:39:01 -0800 2015,Fri Mar 06 00:00:00 -0800 2015,,1,0

He is struggling in his position at the church, and wishes to help move past the homophobia and into acceptance. He's a godly man, but he's also human--and he hates Lucas Cain, the newly-released convicted killer of his younger brother, Jimmy. 
 Lucas Cain is 22 and a closeted gay man who has struggled with his sexuality and close-up, violent homophobia and abandonment his whole life. He was released after three years of serving a 6-year sentence for manslaughter, due to his exceptionally good behavior in jail. Lucas cannot forgive himself for his drunken fight which killed Jimmy Webber, and his remorse is bone-deep. 
 Here's the scene that sets this whole book in motion: 
 ""They're having a party,"" Mark said. He shifted to the side, staring at the scene in front of him. Three or four long tables had been shoved together like the bar did when sports teams came in after their games, but on this night, no one was celebrating a great pitch or brutal body check. This night, the guest of honor was a blond kid with cold green eyes, sitting at the head of the table with his hand wrapped around a mug of beer. He was smiling at the woman next to him as if she were the most beautiful and charming thing he'd ever seen. The rest of the extended table was lined with laughing, celebrating drinkers welcoming home their prodigal son. 
 The man who had killed Mark's baby brother was being treated like a hero. 
 This book is about the difference between appearance and reality. Mark believes that Lucas is out drinking and carousing. In reality, Lucas is grudgingly dragged to a celebratory outing, drinks a non-alcoholic brew, and constantly watches the clock so he that doesn't stay out past his imposed curfew. 
 Father Mark is the main liaison for a halfway house where Lucas ends up when his best (and perhaps closeted) friend Seth kicks him out. Homeless and jobless, Lucas needs a place to stay, but Mark twists things in his own mind, creating more havoc for Lucas--out of his own prejudice and hate. It is Mark's misspoken words that land Lucas in the hospital from a hate crime, in fact. 
 Mark begins to see the error of his ways, soon, and he asks both God and his boss at the church to intercede. At this point, I stopped hating Mark. See, as a reader who gets both sides of the story, I was REALLY mad with Mark's lack of compassion, and, frankly, lack of honor. He knew he should have asked for help, or asked to be replaced, but he craved the ability to watch Lucas, and even to make life more difficult for him. To punish Lucas, as he should have been in jail. Even better, to send Lucas back to jail to serve out the rest of his sentence. But Mark turns his sinking ship of hate around and does the right thing, and for that I stopped hating him. 
 Over a few months, Lucas develops himself. He works hard and plays within all the rules. He commits to staying sober and free of fighting. Never misses a curfew, and makes a few new friends. He inadvertently lands in some trouble when a young boy takes a crush on him, but he does the right thing--because Lucas always does the right thing, even if he knows it could land him in trouble. And, Mark is able to see that more and more. It is Mark's close scrutiny of Lucas that shows him that Lucas was simply caught in a bad moment, in that fight with Jimmy. Mark himself knows that Jimmy was a brawler, and clearly outweighed Lucas by a lot. This turning point allows Mark to see Lucas as a man, not a killer. 
 And, before Mark even realizes what's happened, he's forgiven Lucas for that ill-judged moment which killed Jimmy. What remains? A developing respect for the man Lucas is becoming. All of this unfolds over about six months of semi regular contact. Before long Mark is finding attraction where he only had scorn, before. Lucas thinks Mark is crazy--for forgiving him just as much as for wanting him. How can a priest love a convict, anyway? 
 There is real emotion here. The slow burn from hatred to love is remarkably poignant. This is not an easy transition, and causes far more heartache than stomach butterflies. There are a few scenes of physical connection, but they are not the centerpiece of this story. The story here is in forgiveness, and grace, and love.",Thu Mar 05 06:06:16 -0800 2015,Thu Mar 05 06:42:26 -0800 2015,Wed Mar 04 00:00:00 -0800 2015,,2,0

 Winter Thane is a gay werewolf, no matter how much his father, Damon, insists there is no such beast. His is also an alphanta, or second to Damon, with pure werewolf blood. They have lived in the wilds of Canada for Winter's whole life (20 years), but are returning to Damon's home pack--the Marketo Pack--in Connecticut. The reason: Damon wants Winter mated to a proper she-wolf. Winter thinks Damon's nuts, but he goes along because Winter does not truly wish to be left behind, alone. 
 Upon arrival, Winter is displayed to all the eligible females, and his only attraction? Matt Partridge, a human FBI agent. While Winter has some support for his homosexuality--the Harker and Marketo packs have several prominent gay werewolves--not a one will allow him to break the Cardinal rule: exposure of his werewolf nature to a human. 
 Well, Matt Partridge isn't quite sure why Winter is so captivating. And, he doesn't understand if Winter's sudden appearance in this locale has to do with either the uptick in drug trafficking or his dead colleague. Matt knows he can't mess up this assignment because he's responsible for his father's care--and dad's dementia is getting worse. Moving to another locale will undoubtedly make things worse. Of course, on the full moon both Matt and his dad go a little moon-mad, leading Matt to seek out some hot outdoor interludes with a willing Winter. 
 The story is more complex than the previous books in this series, but involves crooked law enforcement, homophobia, break-up-to-make-up, and shifting power dynamics in the Marketo and Harker packs. Winter is recruited to help Matt. And also the local drug lord. And also factions in the Marketo/Harker pack who don't care for current alpha politics. He must carefully tread the lines between these competing interests, and his attempt to woo Matt. 
 Winter is a truly white knight who rescues more than Matt, and the baddies get what's coming. The book ends with an HEA, and more than puppy love. Expect hot and dirty lovin' and a lone wolf who finds a true pack home.",Tue Mar 03 10:36:17 -0800 2015,Tue Mar 03 10:57:25 -0800 2015,Sun Mar 01 00:00:00 -0800 2015,,2,0

His pack's territory is recently under attack from a NYC wolf, Nikel Eliazer. They want to control the whole of Connecticut, and the Harker pack is small and vulnerable to a hostile takeover. 
 The way Cole's father arranges to strengthen his pack? A marriage alliance between Cole and the alpha daughter of the neighboring Marketo pack. Problem? Cole is an out gay male. For his whole life Cole has heard that there's no such thing as a gay werewolf, but he begs to differ...he's very much a werewolf, and just as much gay. 
 Turns out Annalise Marketo doesn't want to marry Cole. Which is pretty crushing, actually. Cole was prepared to sacrifice his happiness for his pack, but Annalise? Not so much. Luckily, Cole is comforted by Paris--Anna's older half-brother who is, well, gay and a panther shifter. Paris is totally attracted to Cole (feeling = mutual) but Paris abhors pack-life. He doesn't want to be tied down, much like the cat he is... 
 With the alliance in shambles, Cole endeavors to head off a war with Eliazar's pack. When he discovers Eliazar has unholy designs on Paris, well, it's a rumble. Especially when Paris goes missing! 
 Cole knows that he can't keep Paris, but he is willing to spend whatever time he can with the alluring cat. Their connection is fast and fierce, though Paris refuses to commit. Cole? Jilted twice. Still, he recognizes Paris as his mate and will protect him to his dying breath. Super glad Paris got that memo before the final exhale. 
 Good action, a quickie connection that mellowed into a more mature love, and battles with foreign packs, homophobes and fear of public speaking abound. This is a super fast read with an interesting cast and delish sexytimes. I liked how Cole's parents were sorry for forcing him into marriage--especially with a woman--and appreciated how open they became in the end. I liked Paris's sassiness, but wished he'd been even a little compassionate to Cole earlier.",Mon Mar 02 09:23:27 -0800 2015,Mon Mar 02 09:58:03 -0800 2015,Sun Mar 01 00:00:00 -0800 2015,,0,0

 Maddie Hyde is a married Philadelphia socialite. Her husband, Ellis, is a 4F, which means he was not drafted into service on account of color-blindness. This is a huge disappointment to Ellis's Colonel father, and Maddie, only child of a scandalous mother and wealthy father, is a huge disappointment to Ellis's mother. She wanted a far better match for her son, and laments their elopement, now four years after the fact. They live with Ellis's parents until a huge falling out on New Years Day--when Ellis speaks out against the Colonel's exploits as an adventurer, and possessor of the world's biggest fishing story--pictures of the Loch Ness monster he supposedly took years before. The Colonel flies into a rage, kicks them out, and Ellis's best friend Hank arranges for this unlikely trio to travel across the Atlantic to hunt Nessie and get Ellis back into his parents' good graces. Maddie, ever the good wife, has no option but to go along. 
 The transit is terrible, and their welcome in Scotland is arctic. So many there have been maimed or killed in the war that these two American hucksters, Ellis and Hank, are not in the least impressive. Maddie, herself, wants to disappear. She was good at it as a teen--being invisible, that is. Her father hardly acknowledged her, and her mother never stopped picking at her. Well, until her mom made a fatal miscalculation with some pills and a bathtub. 
 The real story is Maddie's opened eyes. She sees the callousness and crass behavior of her husband, and Hank. She sees how many of her ""heart"" pills Ellis consumes daily (10-15) and how much liquor both Ellis and Hank drink. She sees how hard the Scots life is, and how her privilege is an impediment to making any friends as this adventure stretches into weeks. And she sees the landlord of the inn where they stay. Angus is a proud fit man, despite his missing trigger finger and other injuries which sent him home from the Front three years previous. 
 What she doesn't see? Nessie. Nobody does, in fact. Ellis and Hank's monster chase is more like a caper filled with whiskey and lots of neglect for Maddie. For her part, Maddie sees the truth pretty early on--Ellis's color blindness is well perhaps not as true as he purports. Confronting him, however, is tantamount to signing her own death warrant. In this time, Ellis has complete control over his wife's physical and financial well-being. 
 There soon begets a cat-and-mouse of sorts. Maddie cannot leave Scotland without support, and her father isn't inclined to lend aid. Maddie does begin to build friendships--with Angus and his inn staff. She works hard while Ellis and Hank play and run off on larks. She learns to stand on her own feet for the first time, and even attempts to support the war effort. The closeness between Maddie and the inn's staff is her saving grace, especially as Ellis becomes more and more fanatical--about the monster and Maddie's pills. 
 (view spoiler)[Ellis himself turns into a monster, and his not-too-subtle threats indicate that a painless procedure (lobotomy) will bring his upstart wife to heel. The end is a race for Maddie to escape Ellis before he can make good on his threats. Her feigning the 'good wife' act is a problem for Angus (and Maddie), but the end is no less spectacular than her acting. New friends in Scotland are willing to go very far indeed (think: poison) to bid the brutish Mr. Hyde adieu, but it never comes to that. Thank the spirits of the Loch! (hide spoiler)] 
 I really love historical fiction/romance. There is a bit of love in this, near to the end, and it's SO worth the wait. Maddie is a fantastic lead in a time where a woman has little-to-no autonomy. Her steps into independence are careful and measured, always hiding her motive of freedom. Ellis is a manipulative husband, who--Maddie believes--has always wanted another, even more unsuitable, partner. Recognizing the sham their marriage is puts Maddie on the path to independence. And she's aided by the untimely demise of the one person who, ironically, refused to assist. I have read many a tale regarding the magic of the Scotland Highlands, and this book brings a bit of that in--either by means supernatural or simply superstitious. The book is unflinching in its relationships. One woman is beaten severely on suspicion of infidelity, while Maddie is certain her husband will medically incapacitate her. 
 Still, there is hope, and love, and camaraderie. Maddie learns to be the whole person she always wished to be, not the vapid socialite that was her assigned role. The language is beautiful and witty and stark, at times. The end is an HEA for many of the characters, and even more unnamed veterans, as this story goes. I truly had no idea the book would be as dark as it turned out, but I was captivated. I could not read fast enough in the last half of the book.

 Edwin is a 31 y/o gay book restorer living in Oxford. Three years ago he bought the house with his long-time boyfriend, Marius, but Marius had (tearfully) left, citing his having changed feelings for Edwin. Marius was a larger than life, exuberant artist, and meticulous, bookish Edwin feels quite shabby as the discarded lover, a rather unlovable sort. Edwin lives a very quiet life in his house, which sits in the middle of a flood plain. He hasn't really tried to get over Marius, and is crippled by his shyness and a speech impediment. 
 The book begins with rain. Because England. 
 Still, this is a lot of rain, and the forecast is for flooding. Edwin has no vehicle and can't go get sandbags, but a helpful Emergency Aide worker, Adam, is able to get him sandbags from a nearby truck. Adam is the civil engineer actually managing this disaster, and spends some time with Edwin and his fellow neighbors, teaching them how to construct proper barricades to keep the water out of their homes. 
 Edwin is attracted to the burly, ginger engineer, but his fear of speaking leads to some awkwardness. Also, Edwin has a true confidence problem. His only real relationship had been with Marius, and it lasted ten years. Edwin fears giving room in his heart to anyone new, anyone who could hurt him. 
 And yet... 
 He tilted his head curious, eyes so steady on mine. 
 His attention. Sweet and intense at the same time. Like a barley sugar I could untwist from its plastic and hold in my mouth. A flood of secret pleasure. Everybody else I know is so used to me. I don't think I bore them---at least, I hope I don't---but I'm everyday, and in some very small way he was making me feel like Sunday best. 
 Adam makes his interest clear, but Edwin cannot initially accept it. His emotional damage is pretty intense. Still, over the three days of rain, Edwin finally sees within himself the spark that first attracted Marius. He feels lovable, and attractive, for the first time in years. He allows his barriers to drop, and ventures into Real Life again, for a blessed change. 
 This is a quiet romance, so there's little more than a few kisses that make the page. Still, I felt as if Edwin was a very dear man, and I so wanted him to find happiness, or at least TRY to find it, with Adam. I'm glad to say he does. The book was quick-read for me, and this Anglophile was charmed by the Brit setting, speech and manner.

 Two foundling twin girls have an imaginary triplet upon whom they blame all their troubles. They have a rather charmed life, adopted by a wealthy bachelor and cared for by a dedicated cook/nanny. As teens, Alexa (Lexi) and Ava have given a whole new dimension to ""Alicia."" 
 Ava likes to have an alternate identity, ""Alicia"", so she can date guys who are socially ""unsuitable"" but fun for a few dates. She leaves them wanting, but occasionally has a time conflict with her dates, so she enlists Lexi to help cover. As they are so close in appearance, the guys are none the wiser. Lexi is the bookish girl, wholly different from the sexier Ava. She does enjoy being Alicia, because this persona is confident and risky. Lexi would never date a rocker, but Alicia? She relishes Eli's soulfulness. 
 Thing is, something has gone horribly wrong. Casey was a grabby-date-rapey-y guy, who Lexi barely escaped from; the next night he was killed. The police are looking for Alicia in connection. But, Alicia doesn't exist. Does she? A speeding ticket for a vehicle Alicia shows up at their home. 
 Then another boy ""Alicia"" dated ends up dead. Now Lexi is determined to figure out who is setting her up, even if it's...Ava. 
 I liked this, but I had some issues with the absolutely dumb things that Lexi does: like posing as Alicia to talk to the police, without telling anyone, just to ""find out"" what the cops knew. That's like Dumb X 1000. Or, when she's been ARRESTED and out on recognizance then learns there's a new target, she poses, again, as Alicia to ""warn him"". As if this won't be a problem. 
 The book is interesting, and I liked all the twists. I didn't guess the true killer until the bigger reveal, so, excellent job with all the red herrings. #Props 
 My biggest issue was with Lexi's almost willful ignorance of the danger in which she operated--she's a suspect in not one, but TWO murders. Even Ava, who is as SoCal superficial as they come, had the good sense to KEEP HER TRAP SHUT under questioning, leading me to wonder why Ava didn't apply for Stanford, instead of the ""bookish"" Lexi. Lexi seemed criminally naive, in that sense. I wonder if teens will see this my way.

 Connor's a powerful attorney and Abby is completing her PhD, so they are busy people--they never spent much time together due to splitting shifts caring for Skylar--but now that Brian's wife died he is better able to care for Skylar on his own. Abby always had a desire for Connor, but no time to pursue him--not that she would have; she's so not his type. He's more of a fantasy, than anything--until he wants more. But, Connor's no good at relationships. He has a rule about only dating a woman for a month and moving on, and he doesn't really want to be so soulless to Nice Girl Abby. Learning that her home is needing repairs, and she's leaving town for two weeks, Connor invites her to stay at his house, an offer she accepts under a ""no sex"" flag. 
 Thing is, she's interested, if he is.... They spend a month developing more of a relationship than either has had, ever. Connor can't wait until her two-week sex ban ends, and let's just say they don't make it the fortnight. Connor is thrilled having Abby in his home. Loves coming home to a big smile and hot-cooked meal. Loves chatting about his day. Loves....Abby. But, will she fit in his corporate law life? Could she survive the shark-infested waters of his business dinners? The end of their month approaches, and Connor's so torn up inside he doesn't know how to handle it, reaching out for advice and healing a long-damaged relationship in the process (yay!) 
 Abby has her own issues. Sure Connor is slick and savvy, but he's also compassionate, and was willing to sacrifice his own happiness to make sure Brian and Skylar were well taken care of. All the best parts of Connor come out in their brief affair, and Abby knows when the 31 days pass she's going to need buckets of crazy glue to seal her broken heart back together. She gets some glaring examples of how brutal a life with Connor would be--thanks to some serious manipulation from Connor's own father--but it doesn't detract from Abby's love for Connor. 
 This is a solid contemporary romance with two human characters I learned to like very much. I got really invested in their story--one month of passion, a bit of a romp that led to (please, god?) more...and I absolutely hated the ending. Really, the last three lines didn't work for me, at all.

 The blurb indicates this is Quin's story, but the POV is actually that of four teen-ish characters: Quin, John, Shinobu and Maud. Quin, John and Shinobu are all training to be Seekers, while Maud is a Dread. In this world are some futuristic weapons and old artifacts, most importantly the athame, a stone dagger which directs navigation through space. 
 The apprentice Seekers are told their role is to be defenders of humanity, but this is not the case under the current trainer: Briac, Quin's father. Briac is a mercenary who uses his power to kill for pay. John already knows this--Briac had attacked his own mother years ago and stolen his family's athame. It is John's sworn duty to get it back. 
 Briac holds John apart in the training, however, neglecting to complete it. John is banished, and urges Quin to run away with him, as they are a clandestine couple. Quin won't; she believes in her noble purpose as a Seeker and is elated to proceed and learn to work the athame, as is Shinobu--until they discover they will be compelled into murder-for-hire. There's a whole lotta angst, what with being an assassin at age 15... 
 Maud is a different creature than a Seeker. As a Dread she is to oversee the Seekers, and make sure they use the athame for the good of humankind. She had been trained (for centuries) by her master, but he is resting between planes and his apprentice is overseeing her--with extreme brutality. She can help the fledgling Seekers, but isn't sure if she should. 
 John returns to claim his athame, leaving Quin's home and family in tatters and bleeding. The rest of the book is a chase through the space of their world for John to regain his athame, Quin to lose-then-regain her memories, Shinobu to become an opium addict then redeem himself, sorta, and Maud is finally able to make the proper choices to right the wrongs which occurred while her master slept. 
 In truth, I have a low threshold for liking fantasy, but this was a convoluted book. Many times I stopped to read something else, and I can't say--even after finishing--that I'm glad I completed it. The threads of this book were woven too loosely for me to see the tapestry. Too many breadcrumbs leading toward later parts with no real cohesiveness. The end was cliffhangery, with a resolution that left the remaining players in pursuit of each other, which was frustrating after such a long read. I know there's a sequel planned, but I'm not sure I'll pick it up. There was nothing wrong with the writing, but the story never grabbed me. There was no trust between people who should have developed a rapport; every character was some awful shade of bad. Parents lie to their kids, knowing it will do them harm, because of a sworn oath? I call BS on that. Sorry. No oath is going to force me to make my kid a murderer. Not one of the adults in his story had one scrap of decency. And, the kids? Quin and Shinobu fall apart. John's the only one with a backbone, and I'm still not sure if he's capable of doing the right thing.

 World note: the story takes place in a steampunk setting, in 1850's England, where vampire and werewolves are a part of society. 
 Sophronia is a 16 y/o student at Mlle. Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies--which is in truth a training school for female spies. This year, Sophronia's education includes lessons in seduction... 
 ""Seduction in its purest form is a never-ending acquisition of knowledge about another individual. Every male is a new challenge, every occasion warrants a different approach Take the greatest of care when applying these techniques, for they can be more dangerous than actual weaponry."" 
 The girls all straightened. Lady Linette's lessons were always interesting, but seduction was supposed to be the best. What young lady didn't want to know how to manipulate a man? This was what finishing school was all about! 
 Sophronia has a BF, Dimity who is more interested in a normal life after school, but Sophronia knows she has several options in front of her. She has an unknown (but she suspects royal) patron who pays her schooling. Plus, she receives regular gifts from a rogue vampire Lord Akeldama high in London society. She has a bosom friend in Lady Kingair ""Sidheag"" whose family is a pack of werewolves in Scotland. 
 It is when Sidheag receives notice that her beloved pack is in disarray and her great-great-grandfather has challenged for Alpha of a London pack, that life goes wonky. Sidheag flees to London to intercept Lord Kingair accompanied by the werewolf arms training teacher, Captain Niall--which will absolutely ruin Sidheag. 
 Meanwhile, Sophronia and Dimity are released form school to attend the engagement ball of Sophronia's brother. Who also has garnered invitations? Dimity's brother PilloverFe and Felix, Lord Mersey both whom attend the companion school, Bunson's School for Evil Geniuses. Pillover isn't much of a fan of Felix, and neither is Sophronia's (inappropriately close) acquaintance Soap. Soap is a black boy who works as a sootie at Mlle Geraldine's, tending the boilers and boys who also work below decks. 
 It seems that Soap and Felix have a bit of a tendresse for Sophronia, thought Sophronia's of mixed opinion on them. She knows Soap is an unsuitable mate; he has no family, and even worse prospects. But Felix, despite being son of an Earl, is also allied with the Picklemen--a secret society which despises the supernaturals in society and wishes to control communication across the nation. As a friend to Sidheag, and receiving aid from a vampire, Sophronia is not opposed to the supernatural, and the Picklem tried to kill her and Dimity in previous books, so she's decidedly against Picklemen. 
 Felix, on the other hand... 
 And then he was bending down, looking as if he might actually kiss her--in the back of an open cart! 
 Turns out that this love triangle intensifies as Soap stows away to keep Sophronia from falling into Felix's affection. Pillover settles this rather succinctly: 
 He addressed Soap, ""Although I respect the courage of a man who wears sating breeches THAT tight, but in the end you'll have to cede to Lord Mersey. He's too much of a peer, you understand? And a bit of a prick, as well."" 
 Interruption of the engagement ball by Sidheag and two werewolves is almost a welcome distraction. Especially when all the mechanicals of the house go absolutely bonkers. Sophronia, Dimity, Sidheag, Felix and Soap depart to bring Sidheag to Scotland, so she can help her uncles in the pack who are likely to be slaughtered now that they have no Alpha and are accused of treason. The ladies dress as boys to ease travel--though this is scandalous--stowaway aboard a train and the trip is entirely eventful. 
 There are two shot victims, two vampire drones tossed over, and three females trained for espionage who pretty much save the day. Felix is ""rescued"" by his father, the Duke and upstanding Picklemen, but not before declaring himself... 
 ""Ouch, darling, must you be so rough?"" 
 ""Just stoppering up your silly mouth."" 
 ""I know a better way."" He pursed his lips at her. 
 Soap isn't quite as lucky. Though he does live to see another day. 
 This series is a hoot, for real. I love the wit, and the banter. It's truly fun, and the new advent of more teen-speak is welcome. Sophronia's world is one of strict social mores, but what does one do when confronted by an aristocratic werewolf in all his hairy...dangly, glory? 
 How on earth was Dimity going to react to dangly bits? Will she faint? She'll probably faint. 
 Spoiler alert: She didn't faint. 
 Still, the book ends with the love triangle slightly bent, Sophronia with a direct patron, and a lot of 'splainin' for Felix, Lord Mersey. Can't wait to find out more...",Fri Feb 06 17:31:24 -0800 2015,Fri Feb 06 18:29:41 -0800 2015,Mon Feb 02 00:00:00 -0800 2015,,2,0

She's pretty, and popular and the star pitcher on her softball team. She has some close friends, among them Sydney, Courtney and Bryce. Bryce is a star baseball player and he's helped Lex with her pitching for years. They even volunteer together at a baseball camp for needy youth. Despite having plenty of cash, Lex is caught shoplifting. 
 She knows it's dumb, but can't help rebelling a little. Her mother is preoccupied with her 7 y/o sister Aurora who easily conforms to Mama's ideal beauty pageant child, unlike Lex. And, Lex's grandma is rapidly declining with Alzheimer's disease...so things are bit out of control. Taking the lipstick seemed a harmless prank, until her mother got involved. Now, instead of whiling away her summer, Lex is working at the SmartMart (think WalMart) on the condition that she does a good job, the police will not be notified. It's, well, mortifying. 
 Mean girls come in to taunt the Princess of SmartMart, and Lex is missing softball practice due to schedule conflicts, prompting pushback from her coach. And worst/best of all? One of Lex's managers is a senior at her high school--Noah--who is a categorical NOBODY after turning Bryce in for a vandalism episode two years prior. 
 Thing is, Noah is nice. And, cute. And, Lex is determined to show up her mother, by being responsible--for a change. In the meantime, Lex learns the truth behind appearances. Maybe Bryce is Petty for holding a grudge so lone. Maybe the goofy greeter lady at SmartMart is the most positive, loving girl Lex's ever met. And maybe Noah's the sweetest, most forgiving person in the whole wide world--someone she shouldn't cast aside on a misplaced loyalty. 
 I really liked this one. Lex is a human girl, with human feelings of inadequacy and fear. Her Grandma is slipping away, and she and her mother don't connect well. She's losing her dominance in softball, and feeling very disloyal to a good friend. But she sees the bet in people, and she works hard, and refuses to give up. The romance between Noah and Lex blooms slowly, with Lex alternately dependent upon (and frustrated with) Friend Zone status. The closer she and Noah get, the more guilty she feels on Bryce's behalf, but in the end Lex makes the choice that is right for her, not anyone else. 
 This is a sweet book, with an interesting and well-paced plot. There is more than a hint of domestic violence, however, so beware that trigger. The innocent romance is age-approriate to teen readers and the life-lessons Lex learns are suitable for everybody on the face of the Earth.",Tue Feb 03 03:33:25 -0800 2015,Tue Feb 03 03:35:11 -0800 2015,Mon Feb 02 00:00:00 -0800 2015,,0,0

 Well... 
 Okay. This is the fourth book in the THIRDS series. And at the end of the previous one, Sloane Brodie was injured by a car bomb explosion. It was (perhaps) fatal and we waited on pins and needles, praying alongside Dex, his partner in their job--and in bed (though THIS is a down-low issue)--to hope that his heart (and Sloane) will make it through the night. 
 I'm not spoiling this part. I will say that it is tense, and the feels are heart-wrecking. 
 Ash has been left to care for/tail Dex as Dex begins the revenge mission to end all revenge missions. Beck Hogan, chief of the Ikelos Coalition and person responsible for Sloane's injuries, is Dex's target--but Dex doesn't know that he is Beck's target. He and Cael are the prime targets for Ikelos operatives who consider Therian THIRDS operatives to be traitors to their race--and knowing that Ceel is precious to Ash, who had recently infiltrated then double-crossed the Coalition. 
 Problem with Dex's vengeance plan? Destructive Delta is put on leave. With Ash and Sloane severely injured, they can't go on patrol, and the brass is determined to keep the unit on ice until Hogan is in custody, or dead. 
 Dex works on the side, however, setting up a shadow office and calling in favors from Delta and Alpha agents--all to take Hogan out. It's dangerous, from a real life and a professional standpoint. There are set-ups and double crosses, and Hogan get the best of Dex time and again. 
 Plus, Dex's really walking a very very thin line of dishonesty--one that could very well cost him his job, and Sloane. 
 The pace never lets up. There is loving that THIRDS fans have been clamoring for (cough, cough CALVING & HOBBS!!!) and Cael and Ash reach an understanding, if nothing else. 
 The intricate web of this world is being tightened and the relationships are becoming strong, more open, and trust is a conscious element within the Destructive Delta group. Plus, all the side characters are more fleshed out, filling roles as POV characters and humor elements.

Mother Of The Year, right? 
 The story begins three years later. Bear has done a valiant job raising the Kid, as Ty Is called. Bear and his on-again, off-again girlfriend Anna and his elderly neighbor Mrs. Paquinn manage the care of Kid, but it's nearly summer and Bear is looking forward to the return of his BFF, Creed from college. What he doesn't expect is the return of Oliver (Otter), Creed's older brother, from his three year self-exile in San Diego. Otter is gay, and he and Bear shared a drunken kiss three years before, the very night Otter up and left for Cali. 
 Bear has always wondered why, but so many people have left him, he doesn't expect any different. 
 But, things are. Otter is depressed and Creed wants Bear to find out why. Turns our Otter has silently loved Bear for a long, long time. He never did anything about it because Bear was straight, and a child, comparatively. There is an 8 year age difference. 
 The writing is so beautiful; we are in Bear's head throughout and we see his slow changes, his gradual acceptance, his deep love for Kid, and Ann, and Creed....and Otter. Their summer of love is tender and tragic, by turns. It seems, this summer, all the chickens come home to roost. Some good, some vile. The absolute love that Bear has for Kid, the way his life is forfeit to caring for his wise, eccentric, ecoterrorist-in-training, 9-going-on-60 year old brother is spectacular, and humbling. 
 This book. THIS book. It is amazing. It is broken and tender and loving and lost and I am better for knowing Bear and Otter and the Kid's story. I want to hug each of them, and make their sorrows cease, but I don't have to because they can do that even better than I can.

 Jody ""Shane"" McShane has had a tough life. His parents died when he was young and his custodial stepfather molested him around age ten--until his older brother, Jason, got wind of it and their altercation ended with death and Jason in prison. 
 Jason got out and gained control of Shane, but Shane's lingering depression led to a failed suicide attempt, and large medical debt. Both Jason and Shane work two jobs to pay the bills--and Shane's earning good tips as a stripper for private parties, until he's drugged and assaulted on a gig. 
 Officer Noel Carlson discovers the barely clad dancer strapped to the bed on his call-out for disturbing the peace. He's attracted to the young man, but doesn't pursue him until they meet again at a local deli. Noel is big on caretaking and he can see that Shane is in trouble. Noel is also helping with the care of his college friend, Tristan, who suffered a brain injury in a gay bashing incident three years prior. 
 Shane is worried about the lack of money, and his brother's growing exhaustion, especially when Jason has a heart-attack. It seems he has a defective gene in his heart, which causes problems--the same ones that killed their mother. Shane is determined to lighten the workload for Jason by removing their debt so Jason can work just the one job and recuperate. So, he signs up for porn shoots. 
 In the meantime, there is a developing relationship between Noel and Shane. And, there are lots of sideways fits and starts for this couple. Shane lies about his porn gigs to both Noel and Jason, ashamed and humiliated that he's doing something as distasteful (and illegal in Pennsylvania here they live) as porn movies. Shane knows he's hurting them, and himself, but determined to fix his financial mess. Noel's got issues with Tristan, and he and Shane are definitely having problems--he's so stunned with the porn revelations, he can't quite handle it, at first. 
 Just when I think we're going to get an HEA, more tragedy strikes, and we gotta settle for an HFN. 
 The writing is solid. The story lines are interesting, though a few times I wanted the pace to pick up. The constant secret-keeping, and they were whoppers, was hard to take after a bit. No doubt I was sad in the end, but there's some lightness there, and a promise that Shane and Noel will find a good path together. It's clear that some of the side characters will get spotlights in future books; Tristan and Gabe (Shane's co-star) in particular were interesting, and seemed to steal a bit of the attention. Lots of hot-n-steamy manlove, too.

I've not read a lot of books with a Chinese cast and setting, and it wasn't clear at first if this was reality or dystopia, but, upon reading I decided that didn't matter so much. It actually is reality-based, but the reality of this world--this lawless slum on the edge of a bustling city--is rather dystopian. 
 Jin Ling is a teenaged girl posing as a boy in Hak Nam, the ruined fort abutting Seng Ngoi. She has been here, living on the streets, stealing to survive, for two years--ever since her father sold her beautiful elder sister, Mei Yee, into prostitution. Their father was an abusive drunk who saw no use in two daughters on a failing rice farm--but Jin and Mei Yee have a deep love for each other, and a survivor spirit. 
 Mei Yee, due to her beauty, has captivated a very rich man, Ambassador Osamu, who pays for her to have the best room in Longwai's brothel, and to be kept for his use only. It is the best life Mei could hope for, but hope is not allowed in her life. 
 Dai is a young man looking for a second chance. Two years ago he was a wealthy man's son, enrolled at the best boarding school, and selling drugs for fun. Then, a drug run went bad, leaving Dai with a smoking gun and three dead bodies. His parents helped him to escape to Hak Nam, where the police are not allowed due to a treaty, and where Dai has lived/survived by keeping his head down. Thing is, the treaty is due to expire in 18 days, and the police want to capture Dai--one of the dead drug runners happened to be the mayor of Seng Ngoi's son. Dai has two choices: 1-flee China and bring further disgrace on his family or 2-get the dirt on Hak Nam's crime boss Longwai. 
 Dai makes an arrangement with Longwai--running drugs--so he can gain access to Longwai's inner circle and find the ledger which contains evidence for conviction, but he cannot do it alone. He recruits Jin, who accepts because she is a super fast runner, and because Longwai's brothel is the only one to which she hasn't been able to gain entrance to search for Mei Yee. Meanwhile, Dai strikes up a friendship with Mei Yee, in the interest of gaining inside information on Longwai and his men. 
 During he 18 day countdown, these three survive some pretty lethal encounters. Mei Yee is abused and nearly turned into a heroin addict. Jin is hunted by a street gang and stabbed. Dai puts his freedom in jeopardy leaving Hak Nam to get the help he needs to complete his impossible task. 
 It took me a bit of time to get used to the narrative, which cuts between three points of view, and the content--the experiences of each narrator are horrifying, all the more so for their realistic setting. It is easy to sympathize with Jin and Mei Yee, but Dai required more warming-up-to. I really got engaged in the story maybe ten chapters in, mostly because the immediate violence and callous environment isn't appealing, to me as a reader. There is a touch of romance--Mei Yee and Dai have an unrequited attraction--which becomes a hindrance to Mei's service to her wealthy patron, but the one thing uniting all these desperate characters is hope. Hope that life will not always be this horrible, lawless, parentless, loveless experience. Hope that, one day, a girl could just be a girl, not a possession to be bought, sold or discarded. Hope that a child could escape the slums and frolic in the sea or gaze at the unpolluted starlit sky. Hope that a son could redeem his past, and build a better future.

 This book is in interesting, well-paced, historical m/m romance between two pairs of lovers in 1880's western US. There is a complicated plot, and few romantic interludes until the closing chapters. 
 It seems, in the West, everybody's got a secret (or six) to hide. Gabriel ""Dusty"" Rose is a well-known English gunman living out his exile in the western states in company of any of many Native American tribes. He's hunted out for use by the Secret Service for information about a Native artifact he may (or may not) have, but he doesn't wish to cooperate and is subsequently jailed for trial--it seems folks are always attacking Gabriel, hoping to be faster on the draw than the legendary killer. Gabriel and two other inmates Cage and Hobson are picked up for transit by two US Marshals--Eli Flynn and ""Wash"" Washington. 
 Flynn and Wash are solid lawmen. They believe in trials and punishment, though Wash is clearly not convinced that the law is always 'right'. These men have been friends for many years, even since the War Between the States, and enjoy each other's company. Flynn has a deeper affection for Wash than he will acknowledge, however Gabriel--a consummate judge of character--clearly notices. Not that Gabriel cares--he prefers men and doesn't hesitate to make this plain. 
 Interestingly, the BULK of the story is told from the POV of Cage, a mute prisoner who has deep secrets and is likely to be hanged for burning diseased Army blankets, and Flynn, who cannot fathom the open affection he witnesses between Gabriel and Cage. 
 The transport of the prisoners is delayed by weather, fighting, and difficult terrain. Just when it seems Cage and Gabriel will be separated, losing the one true connection either of them had mustered in some time, there's a switch, and the foursome of Flynn, Wash, Gabriel and Cage end up going downriver on a paddle boat bent for trouble. When it is seized by river thieves, Flynn must depend upon Gabriel, an uncommon killer, to help him save Wash--and all the rest of the passengers. (But, mostly Wash) 
 They four men build a tight comaraderie over the course of this book--and the resolution is clearly meant to build into a new adventure. Flynn's constant exposure to Gabriel's insightful, if unwelcome, commentary causes Flynn to investigate his feelings about Wash, and leads to the best connection of his life. Cage has terrible secrets, which come to light in captivity, but it's Gabriel's affection that wins out. 
 The book reads a lot like a Maverick/Indiana Jones plot, lots of foreshadowing, governmental intrigue, and double-crosses, with a dash of romance here and there. I did vey much enjoy the ride, and I'd likely go back for more. I had wished for more steam, and to better understand this Native artifact, but it seems that will be reserved for the next story.

 Beginning to end, I adored the heck out of the absolutely sexy, filthy, fun kinky book. 
 Jeremy is a grad student working on his PhD at Cal in San Francisco. He's 
 a good-looking 27 y/o gay man, and, struggling with his finances, he's been recruited to work as a server at The Dinner Club--an establishment for titillating dining. The job is, essentially, to be scantily clad and deliver each of six courses to his assigned diner. As each course is passed, the diners get to remove an article of their server's costume--until the servers are all nekkid. 
 Oh, and the diners can pay for the servers to ""perform"" for them. And, to spend a night with the server of their choice--if the servers should so choose. There's lots and lots of tip money, and Jeremy's scared but willing. It's not as if he hasn't had anonymous hook ups before. And his first diner, ""Mr Green"" is so handsome, and nearly as bashful as Jeremy. 
 Brice Martin is a patent attorney. He's mid-thirties and newly returned to San Fran after he and his long-term BF split. One of the partners at the venture capital firm where Brice now works has sprung for a fun night out--at The Dinner Club. Brice isn't really a fan of voyeurism, and even less a fan of paying for a man's company, but he is in a bit of a bind what with his boss urging him on. He's mesmerized by the nubile young man, ""Remy,"" who arrives with the starters--and thankful for his colorful pseudonym--Green with envy, actually. 
 Jeremy and Brice are far more tame at the table than their boisterous diners/servers, but plenty turned on, as well. Brice's boss comps a ""nightcap"" (overnight stay) for Brice to further enjoy Jeremy, but they are equally tentative behind closed doors. Their caution underlies the uncertainty of their feelings--Jeremy doesn't want to feel like a prostitute, and Brice wants a lover who desires him of his own will--not for cash. Still they relish each other a bit, and Brice realizes his attraction hasn't waned. He wants more Remy. 
 On his next visit to The Dinner Club, this time with a wealthy closeted client, Brice chooses a different server, hoping that his attraction was simply a novelty. Watching Remy serve another man, however, is aggravating. And Jeremy's a bit hurt that he wasn't requested by the lovely Mr Green. 
 Thing is, there's so much else going on--while Brice and Jeremy are learning to connect and bond with each other, Jeremy's research is progressing--and, yet, suffering. He's studying a novel approach to HIV vaccination and the results are SO promising, but his finances are drying up--a joint Biotech/academic partnership pays for his research but the biotech firm is losing its venture capital. Meanwhile, Brice's firm is in a position to fully fund Jeremy's research, but a miscommunication throws all that into jeopardy. 
 Brice and Jeremy may have a chance, if they can only learn to trust one another's intentions. Jeremy doesn't want to be ""kept"" and Brice doesn't want to ""share"" him with The Dinner Club. Their feelings develop over a period of a few months--as they make an effort to meet outside of The Dinner Club illicitly.

 Captain Archie Curtis is a survivor of a horrific injury while serving in the British army--not even in battle. While inspecting a shipment of weapons, Archie and his platoon were maimed and fatally wounded when their rifles exploded in their hands. Archie lost three fingers and has a limp from a misfired round that caught him in the knee. He dwells in misery, feeling half-a-man due to his loss of fingers, livelihood, and companions. 
 Acting on a tip, from the faulty gunmaker no less, Archie accepts the invitation of an old family friend Sir Hubert Armstrong, for a two week stay at his remote country house. Sir Hubert is an industrialist, and his lavish home is a marvel of electric feats. It seems that Sir Hubert has been accussed of tampering with the very weapons which destroyed Archie's compatriots. The house company is interesting, but Capt. Curtis is rather annoyed with Daniel da Silva, a flamboyantly effeminate ""poet"" who is not only Portuguese, he's a Jew. 
 The other male guests take thinly veiled jabs at Daniel, but Archie's most frustrated that da Silva's always underfoot when he's investigating Sir Hubert's private files. They men strike up a tenuous partnership when it seems that they are both seeking Sir Hubert's dark secrets. 
 Meanwhile, they're captured in a compromising position--one in which they could be prosecuted--or fall under Sir Hubert's more dark enterprise: blackmail. 
 Daniel is quite comfortable with his 'invert' sexuality, but Archie hasn't ever considered himself gay. Still, Archie can't deny the strange attraction he's beginning to experience for the wily da Silva. 
 There's a whole lotta intrigue in this book. And a quietly developing tender romance. The stakes are death if da Silva and Archie are caught by Sir Hubert, and I'll just say, the book ends with quite a few deaths. Super high tension, mostly on the intrigue-side, however. 
 I loved the fervor Archie had in pursuit of da Silva, and protecting him from the very dangerous tenants of Sir Hubert's abode. There was such biting humor, and such valiant gallantry. I swooned.

The writing was a bit spartan, much like the MC, Thomas Elkin. Tom is 44, divorced, and a successful architect. He's newly single, out as gay for the past four years, and attracted to his new intern--who also happens to be a childhood friend of Tom's 22 y/o son. 
 It's a predicament. Cooper is young, lithe and attractive, but he's also a darned good architect and has a passion for design that matches, if not rivals, Tom's. They are a good match, setting aside the age difference. Oh, and the fact that Tom is essentially Cooper's boss. 
 The men work together for weeks, building a deep rapport, one that Tom can see Cooper fashioning to his expectation--Cooper is insanely attracted to Tom, something Tom finds flattering, and perplexing, by turns. Their attraction turns to the physical, all on the down-low, but at times it was a bit too down low, for me. Would have liked to see more heat between this silver fox and his straight-talking protege. The end had it's predictable work-spat conclusion/resolution, which was entirely satisfying. This is a series I'll follow. 
 My biggest gripe with the book was the CLEARLY BRITISH diction and spellings. The men are American, the story set in America. Idiom wasn't a big problem here, but it was a bit aggravating.

Maddie attempts to call a second time, urged by her best friend ""Stubby"" Shroeder, to impress the seriousness of the situation--and is rebuffed, with hostility. That is, until the young boy goes missing. Only, Maddie knows he's not just missing--he's dead. The Feds are in on the case, and Maddie finds herself at the center of their investigation. Her uncle, Donny, a slick lawyer, does his best to cast suspicion away, cautioning Maddie against doing any further readings--but she inadvertently sees a local girl with a looming death date--and Stubby insists they try to help. 
 Their interference only lands both of them in huge trouble, and the Feds are mounting a case file that could put both Maddie and Stubby in jail for a good long time. Meanwhile, Maddie fights the system, trying to prove that her ""gift"" is what gives her insight, as small as it is. She's got the added trouble of bullying at school, and her mother going on increasingly more dangerous benders. I honestly got chills reading about Maddie peeling her mom off one floor, or another, and putting her back to bed safely--when her mom managed to make it home. 
 Maddie's world has become an even more frightening place as strange trucks chase her down dark streets and yet another child is kidnapped. The FBI is, at first, hostile, but Maddie fights to win their support against Uncle Donny's wishes--he's sure they're going to set her up. Proving her gift is legit is nearly as hard as proving the Tooth Fairy exists, however. 
 Still, Maddie never gives up trying to demonstrate her (and Stubby's) innocence. Not when her mom takes a turn for the worst. Not when Stubby's the lead suspect. And not when it seems the FBI wants to name her as an accomplice to a serial murderer. It's a taut, emotional drama that moves with grace. Several suspects exist, all of whom are equally likely, keeping the reader guessing until the closing scenes. 
 The adults are very real people, not simple characterizations. Maddie's mom is pathetic and sympathetic. Uncle Donny is a champ, and keeps the Feds from steamrolling two awesome kids. Stubby is the kind of best friend I would dream my kids find--selfless, kind and cheerful to a fault. Even the FBI agents who threaten Maddie at every turn aren't as ruthless as they first seem. I expected the ending, but that's like chocolate sprinkles on the thriller sundae.

 Issac is 18 and due to begin Church in his sheltered devout Amish community in Zebulon, Minnesota. He has lived here for the past seven years, ever since his sect had broken from a more ""worldly"" Amish community in Ohio. This community breach occurred because three Amish teens drowned while intoxicated in the period of rumspringa, a time of youthful experimentation (rebellion) in Amish communities that precedes adulthood and marriage. Rumspringa is forbidden in their new community. 
 In this new community, Issac's family is less well-off. In Ohio they were allowed to have English jobs and sell their handicrafts openly. Their new locale is far more remote and restrictive. The families must subsist off the land by farming, and minimal sales of wares to tourists. Issac is unsure how to live in this life--he's not interested in farming--and he also misses his older brother, Aaron, who ran away. 
 Isaac's father arranges for Isaac to become and apprentice carpenter, to David a man the community is questioning. David is 22 and unwed. This is strange, and Isaac wonders why David, who is industrious and attractive is unmarried. He also feels shame for finding David attractive--especially as David's sister, Mary, makes no secret of her interest in Isaac. All of Isaac's friends are beginning ""dating"", and Isaac has no interest. 
 Working with David becomes a torture--Isaac is so incredibly, shamefully, interested in David. The best/worst thing? It seems David reciprocates. 
 Okay, David TOTALLY reciprocates. And David has a secret life in the ""English"" world that Isaac never could have dreamed. Together, David and Issac find love, but it isn't meant to be. There is no homosexuality in the Amish community, and especially not their even more restrictive sect. Their time together becomes a forbidden rumspringa, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous their feelings become. If they are caught, they will be shunned, leaving David's widowed mother and five sisters without a provider. Isaac fears his family will also suffer, having two sons who are shunned. 
 Still, as David takes steps to begin a family life, Isaac realizes that he cannot stay in Zebulon. His heart is David's and he can't go on pretending that he'll one day marry. Isaac finds the courage to make his future outside--and his love is soon rewarded. 
 This is, without question, an HEA. And the Amish life was so detailed and well-described, I could feel the constriction around my heart for Isaac and David. I had never imagined the Amish life would be so interestning, or complicated. Even Isaac's siblings feels stifled in this new life. His younger brother, Ephraim, begins to strike out against the many rules of their world. Meanwhile, David's family is in constant scrutiny--and yet he finds his path rightly.

 Marcus ""Grif"" Griffin is a poorly-endowed man. He only recognized his ""equipment"" was substandard on his first day of junior high gym class when all the boys were naked in the shower and Grif's stick didn't measure up. 
 He is gay--he knows this from a young age--but he doesn't know how to handle being so deficient. Luckily, Grif has a very understanding, and accommodating, father who ensures Grif is never in danger of being exposed. 
 The book shifts time frames almost by chapter, though the entire book is told from Grif's POV. We can see that Grif is currently in a relationship, with a Dom-type man, Wes. At first, I hated Wes. I thought he was inordinately cruel to Grif, but, as I read on, I could see the development of Grif's character dynamic. He has a humiliation kink, and Wes has a sadist streak that loves to exploit it. 
 We get snatches of Grif's first sexual partner--Tate, his ""straight"" college roommate and bestest friend in the whole world--even if the sex is all one-sided. We learn about the deep bonds that Grif makes, first with Tate and then with Wes. The sex is not as steamy as other BDSM books, mainly because it is always tempered by humiliation and orgasm denial. As a reader I was totally in synch with Grif's emotional landscape. When he was anxious about exposure, I was, too. I think that's the mom in me, but I was thoroughly engaged--which, again, is why I hated Wes so much. All I wanted was for Wes to love and satisfy Grif--but what I didn't get until, perhaps, the final third of the book was: he was. Wes thoroughly satisfied Grif, in every way Grif desired. 
 When the timeline flashed into Wes and Grif meeting, and how they took baby steps forward to the point where Grif was able to feel like a total man, not a disappointing or deficient one, I was ready to jump into Wes' arms and smooch him all over his face. 
 These two are a really special couple.",Thu Jan 08 17:45:03 -0800 2015,Thu Jan 08 18:01:26 -0800 2015,Thu Jan 08 00:00:00 -0800 2015,,8,0

 Derrick is an out-of-work lumberjack native to BWB. His parents ran a B & B for his whole life, and Derrick was teased mercilessly as a child, in ways that indicates he was emasculated/gay for living/working in a frilly, nancy-boy B&B. Derrick was actually gay and stayed closeted, as he couldn't bear to disappoint his dad, in the event his dad would have been disappointed/disapprove. It's unclear if this would have been the case, but regardless, Derrick's parents died three years ago and now he's doing a very poor job of running their B&B--on account of never learning to cook/clean as this was too much ""woman's work"" for him to consider undertaking. Derrick has a lot of self-hate, and prejudicial beliefs about how ""real men"" should behave, and he's pretty much a self-imposed shut-in, and still very much closeted. 
 He's about ready to close down the B&B entirely when Ginsburg Sloan arrives, soaking wet, with a broken wrist, on his doorstep. Ginsburg is a stunt actor on the Wolf's Landing crew, and he needs a cheap place to stay for the 8-12 weeks of recovery before he can return to work. 
 Derrick is attracted, but--even more so--he's sympathetic. He can see that Ginsburg has been kicked around a lot. (view spoiler)[ Turns out Ginsburg is a transman, and (hide spoiler)] Derrick wants to help him, but at the same time he can't shut the B&B without turning Ginsburg out--which he won't do. So he tries to make the place as unlivable as possible hoping Ginsburg will just leave. 
 Ginsburg is unaffected by Derrick's hot and cold ways. He's incredibly cheerful, and even helps out with B&B chores, cleaning and cooking--ultimately winning Derrick over. He pries Derrick from his cocoon, and they begin a slow courtship. (view spoiler)[This is the first book I have read that encompassed an explicit trans-gay sexual scene. (hide spoiler)] I thought the smexytimes were well handled, though the book could have had a bit more heat. One scene happens on the closing pages, and the only other was about 60% in. (view spoiler)[I'm not sure why the delay, except that the authors perhaps thought the audience needed a lot of acclimatizing before this ""unconventional"" sexual scene. (hide spoiler)] 
 With Ginsburg's help, Derrick begins to see his bigoted, double-standard ideas for what they are: ridiculous. For all that Ginsburg is smaller and somewhat effeminate, he's courageous--in his professional and personal life. And despite being a burly lumberjack, Derrick knows he's a coward in comparison. 
 There's a break up--and it's ugly. But the make up? It's so damned beautiful. It turns out Ginsburg is everything Derrick wanted and never had the courage to find. Excellent supporting characters like Derrick's ex--a flamboyant gay man, and even the disgruntled purple-haired transitioning barista-teen keep the story on point regarding personal acceptance and rejection of traditional gender roles.

 Shelby lives a very sheltered life. She's almost 18 and never gone to school. She is homeschooled by her mother, Shaylene, and spends 6 of 7 days a week in their apartment in Scottsdale, AZ. Every Friday they leave the apartment together, so Shelby can hit balls at the local batting cage, then they have ice cream for dinner and Shelby goes to the library, unescorted, for a few hours while her mother works. This library time is the only time Shelby is ever left alone outside their apartment. 
 She has never has a friend, and has no siblings. Her father is dead, and he was horrible, or so she has been told. Then, one Friday, while waiting to get picked up outside the library, Shelby is struck by a car. In her pain she meets, well, a coyote, who advises her that she will learn two lies and one truth about her life. 
 For a moment I wondered if Shelby had hit the peyote, but she hadn't. She did have a broken ankle, however, and in the aftermath of her care finds herself and her mother on the road. Escaping, her mother tells her, from her (dead) father. Because if he finds them, they're as good as dead. Yep. Guess Shelby's dad isn't so dead after all. 
 Or, is he? How can Shelby trust her mom--as she watches her befriend unsuspecting men with the objective of stealing their vehicles. And, the coyote continues to return. 
 When Shelby sleeps she falls into the Dreaming, a place of myth and mystery where she is the Maiden and must rescue the crying Child from a malevolent force in order to restore the rain and keep the Dreaming alive. In this mythical place Shelby is aided by the trickster Coyote, as well as the stalwart Elk and strong Eagle. It is here she is told she has 8 days to save the Child or the Dreaming--and Shelby's whole universe--will be destroyed. 
 This is a strongly metaphysical book, with real and mythical touch points. In her waking life, Shelby learns that there are very big portions of her life that are lies, and the truth that is revealed is just as devastating. There are car chases, and police actions and people who try to help and end up only causing more harm. 
 I adored the elements of First Nations mysticism and mythology that were interwoven. This book sang with cultural tenets, and a realistic depiction of a displaced teen. Shelby, herself, is at a major disadvantage as her own advocate--not because she is young (she's almost an adult) but because people assume she is disabled. She has some difficulties, but that doesn't diminish her capability. Throughout Shelby is self-possessed and as independent as she is ever allowed to be. 
 I am not ashamed to admit there were twists I didn't see coming. I did, however, predict the bulk of the ending--as the foreshadowing was excellent. The ticking time bomb of Shelby's world is a strong motivator, but she can't often access the tools, or skills, she needs to complete her quest in the Dreaming, and must return to reality to marshal resources. In the end, the heartache that is Shelby's life is greatly resolved, on her terms for a change. No more isolation. Actual friendships and autonomy, and a family she never expected.

 Nash Holly is an impulsive out gay man living in Bluewater Bay managing his family's garage and working as lead mechanic. Nash's twin brother (Healey) is away at Stanford, and Nash and his father spend a lot of time caring for/managing Nash's younger half-sister, Shelby. Shelby's 15 and permanently disabled due to a traumatic spine injury as a child. Nash is used to being the rock on which people lean, and he's always eager to lend a helping hand--which is what he does when he meets a stranded motorist one foggy evening. 
 Spencer Kepler-Constantine is in the midst of a divorce from his husband, Peter, who has--it turns out--impregnated one of the many women he slept with. Peter's not into monogamy, not that he had ever been during their courtship, but Spencer feels (rightly) betrayed, not least because Peter's baby-mama is an attention-seeking, sniping actress. Spencer's in Bluewater Bay to film a few episodes of the on-going Wolf's Landing show on which all these linked books are based. A couple more weeks and he can just hole up in his quiet Park City home out of the spotlight. He wants to get over his heartache, but he doesn't know how to relax--and meeting Nash is a cool breeze compared with the burning celebrity spotlight. 
 At first, they are casual. A make out with benefits. A secret date hidden for the paparazzi. But, their secret is soon discovered and Nash's family gets caught up in the moil. Plus, they have their own drama to manage. Shelby wants more and more independence. And, Nash's dad seems to be dating. It leaves Nash feeling....unneeded. And he is, unfortunately, beginning to like Spencer more than he should. The filming is wrapping soon, and the fireworks between Spencer and his ex are coming rapid-fire. Peter is making all sorts of 'grand gestures' and Nash knows he can't compete. 
 Can he? He's just a rebound guy, after all. Right? 
 I really enjoyed this. Spencer and Nash are two lovely men who have sincere emotional landscapes. Nash continually throws Spencer off-kilter by having no agenda other than to help Spencer feel good/better. And Spencer is so sexy and responsive to Nash--it's the ultimate turn on to be wanted so desperately. They make a sweet, kind couple and their brief separation only pinpoints how much their feelings have evolved over their courtship.

They are both juniors in college and have been friends for two years. Collin feels really awful about his sexual attraction, not only because he doesn't believe Tanner would welcome his interest; Collin was raised by his uber-conservative, uber-Catholic mother to believe all sex (even self-love) was bad, unless it was sanctioned by marriage. And homosexual marriage does not qualify. 
 Tanner has a regular Monday night hook-up with a female friend, Wendy, and Collin usually pretends he's asleep so he can hear Tanner have sex. One Monday night Tanner comes home alone and Collin watches him pleasure himself--with unexpected--but wonderful--results. Turns out Tanner is bisexual, and has a crush on Collin. 
 This confession opens a new, scary chapter in Collin's life--one where he has all the best of love...which he must hide from everyone around him. Tanner isn't out at school, but he's open to the possibility. Colin knows what will happen if he comes out--his mother will disown him. As Collin and Tanner become closer, however, it becomes more and more difficult to keep their secret--and doing so may just cost Collin the man he truly loves. 
 This book is equal parts hot man lovin' and delicious feels. The pace is brisk, and the sex is copious. And scorching. Collin is a complete novice, and enthralled by Tanner's openness and experience. They are a good match for each other, and conscientious of each other. Their main conflict, remaining closeted, is a big hurdle which is well managed.

 Jack has been suspended com his east coast college for harassment of a fellow student, Tom Worthington. Tom's father had orchestrated a Ponzi scheme which took down the retirement, college and investment funds of many--including Jack's father's. While a student, Jack resented seeing Tom on campus and his campaign of hate resulting in Jack's discipline--and a disgraceful return to his dismal home in Colchester Falls, Iowa. Jack's family is in a bad way--his mother's a functional (but really dysfunctional) alcoholic and his father is emotionally unavailable. Plus, these relationships have been further strained by Jack being an out gay man. 
 Upon his return, Jack encounters his high school boyfriend, Mike Vargas, who is now running a farm-to-table eatery featuring the produce of his family farm. Mike was supposed to go east with Jack three years ago, but gave up his scholarships to stay on the farm when his father had a second heart attack. Mike is a smart, industrious man, but he's stifled in this small community, always on guard to keep his sexuality on the down low. People know he's gay, but he's too timid to ""flaunt"" it, fearing his business will suffer. He's hopelessly angry/in love with Jack. The love was from their six year history as friends/lovers (junior and senior high school) but he hates how Jack just left--early--for college and left him behind. 
 This reconnection story is well told and has good pacing. Jack doesn't win Mike back immediately. Mike is on constant guard of his heart, never giving Jack the chance to work his Jack-magic. In the meantime, they do work together, and through Mike's selfless example, Jack grows out of his angry-at-the-world stance. He reaches out to other at-risk youth, helping to form a GSA at his former high school. This brings him in touch with his old guidance counselor who helps him find some peace regarding his mother worsening alcoholism. 
 All the good is really working in Jack's favor--so much so, he makes a grand gesture to resolve his difficulties at school--and tries to broaden Mike's world, as well. 
 Mike had felt overlooked by his father for a long time--being passed over for management of the farm was especially cutting--but through some hard truths from papi and Jack, Mike learns that, perhaps, this small town life isn't his ultimate destiny. 
 It's a good story. I really enjoyed Jack's change from petulance to maturity. Mike is a great guy, and he deserves all that he receives. His recognition that his need to ""save"" Jack was a hindrance to their growth as a couple, and enabled them to become more equal partners going forward.

 Mick is tired of the girl merry-go-round and meathead football teammates mucking up his studying. He's invested in getting his degree in fitness and nutrition at Cornell, and decides quitting the team and finding an off-campus house will be his best chance at keeping his eyes on the prize. It means working two-jobs and having a housemate (or two) but that's the price of success. 
 Fielding is a 19 y/o physics prodigy. Actually he's a prodigy at everything, except, perhaps, taking care of his physical, social or emotional needs. He spent his life homeschooled, but was eager to GO to grad school--that's right, he's getting his PhD at 19. Fielding has a smother-mother and an absentee dad and decides living with Mick is absolutely the best idea he's had yet. With dad's money to burn he takes both spare bedrooms in Mick's rental house, with the added bonus that Mick will cook for them if Fielding's daddy buys the groceries. 
 Over the course of a semester of living together, Mick and Fielding become very close friends. Mick has helped Fielding break out of his cloistered shell--teaching him to exercise, eat healthy foods, and update his wardrobe. They spend hours watching the movies Fielding had never had access to, and discussing any and everything imaginable in their spare time. 
 And that includes Fielding's fears over an obnoxious girl in his physics classes. According to Fielding she's a ""virgin killer"" and she's determined to kiss Fielding under the mistletoe at the department Christmas party. Thing is, Fielding's never kissed anyone. And he's mortified that he'll be exposed as a novice in front of all his professors and peers, so he begs Mick to teach him how to kiss. 
 And, Mick freaks out. 
 As Mick soon learns, his fear of being ""gay"" is pretty much unfounded. Because, when it comes to Fielding, he's found someone he can't live without. The story is told from Mick's POV, and he's about as conflicted as a 20 y/o het male can be--when it comes to recognizing an unwelcome attraction to another male.

He always loved acting, but hated the business of being an A-List actor, especially because it made him hide his bisexuality--or, essentially, his attraction for men. It seems Levi's only real relationship was with a man, and he denied that for years--to protect his career, and because his parents are intolerant alcoholic homophobes. He's being offered a role working on a TV show filing in Bluewater Bay--a role he relishes, but only under the agreement that he's heterosexual; the production has a gay lead and lesbian director and the studio isn't interested in becoming a Pride Extravaganza. 
 Levi considers the opportunity for a good bit of time, always with an eye to refusing. This is difficult since Levi's inordinately attracted to Carter Samuels--the out, gorgeous 20-something star of the show. Carter returns this attraction--Levi was THE ACTOR Carter idolized throughout his adolescence--and he's had years of fantasies over the strapping star. 
 Problem is, both men are attracted to each other in a non-sexual way, as well. They have so many common interests, and enjoy spending time together. The tension crackles between them, however, and, when Levi signs the contract, it's combustible on camera. Still, it's not easy maintaining a platonic distance. Levi won't come out, and Carter won't be closeted. The dynamic is tense, and the stakes are high. Both men know this connection isn't something to move past easily, and, yet, moving forward is equally as difficult. 
 I enjoyed the tension. I liked both characters, and was glad that Levi could see how destructive his ""persona"" was to his actual life. There's not much smexytimes, and I almost felt like Ms. Witt was ""mentally edging"" me with all the tease and release. The ending was satisfying, however, and I enjoyed the story very much.

He's openly gay, but not ostentatious, and never imagined being part of a frat, but was courted by the magnetic Micah--frat pres, and one of Sloane's TA's. Micah's attractive, sure, but he's straight. Unfortunately, Sloane is inexplicably drawn to Micah's burly, butch younger brother--Hank--who seems to have more than a particular dislike for Sloane. 
 Micah, ever the fence-mender, assigns joint chairmanship of the big Winter Party to Sloane and Hank. It's awkward and painful, for Sloane. He finds Hank attractive and rude, by design. Hank can't explain why he hates Sloane, but he's not happy with his brother's machinations and only agrees to this plan if Micah promises to never pair him and Sloane up again. 
 Their collaboration is spot on, the party a rousing success, and Hank relishes in the knowledge that he and Sloane won't spend any further time together, while he secretly, shamefully, acknowledges his growing attraction to Sloane. Hank doesn't want to be gay, and Sloane's cultured personality and general friendliness are too hard for Hank to accept; he can't wait for break so he can find some relief in absence. 
 A change in Christmas plans, however, has Micah inviting Sloane to spend the break on their family farm.

The tension runs fast and furious, as Sloane, Micah and Hank learn to co-exist in the happy household. Their parents are over-the-top accommodating, and encouraging for their sons to find the happiness a loving relationship can bring.

 Dex and Sloane are having a covert relationship. Which makes for lots of fun stealth hook-ups. About the relationships: Sloane and Ash are both Therian shifters who actually grew up together in the pre-THIRDS program. They suffered a lot, as the Powers That Be examined them, learned how the Therians worked, how they shifted, and taught them to control the beast within. It was terrifying, and Sloane is scared that Dex will leave him if he knows the truth about his history. 
 Thing is, Dex couldn't care less. Well, that's not entirely true. He cares about Sloane being happy. If Sloane's past makes Sloane pensive, or angry, closed off, well then Dex cares. But details about Sloane's mistakes as a scared child? Pfft. Nada worries. 
 Can I say I love Dex? I may be a human woman, and therefore thoroughly unattractive to this fictional gay man, but I swoon for him, nonetheless. He is just so fun, and flirty and intriguing. I guess that's why everyone (excepting Ash) adores him. #GuiltyAsCharged 
 In this episode we also have Cael, Dex's foster brother, revealing his deep affection for Ash--and Ash being a bigger total D-bag than usual. Which is saying a lot because Ash is a D-bag all the time. Okay, I do love Ash, too, because I understand that he's been broken, but it takes a good bit of love to consider that his turn-coatery is actually much more than it appears. And, his repulsion of Cael's affection is for Cael's own good. Mostly because loving Ash is more difficult and painful than hugging a Saguaro cactus. 
 The plain truth is, rogue Therians are executing humans who did a whole lot of Therian killing in the big skirmishes years ago, and it's up to Dex, Sloane and Destructive Delta crew to ride point on the capture. This is made more complicated by the revelation that a mole exists within THIRDS and all the opportunities to apprehend the offenders result in chasing smoke on the wind. 
 This thoroughly realized action-adventure-shifter-police procedural-gay-romance is sure to satisfy the most genre-confused among us. And, I'm so eager for the next novel in the series I'm having trouble holding back the begging to Ms. Cochet. Good thing she throws out short THIRDS vignettes every Thursday on her blog. It's like a weekly hit of my fave fictional drug, which softens the withdrawl symptoms just enough to manage.

 He kidnaps Jess from Hendrix's ship, sure that Hendrix will come after her and the showdown will ensue, but Dimitri isn't satisfied--in the least. He has to keep Jess near him at all times, fearing she'll escape, and this puts a serious cramp in Dimitri's smexytimes with his cadre of gals. Jess is attractive to Dimitri, but she's not the whore he took her for. 
 See, Jess hasn't willingly given herself to a man, ever. She didn't think she'd ever want to, not after Roger ruined her, but something about the sheer masculinity of Dimitri calls to her. She can see he's been broken before--the way he won't let people touch him is a sign with which she can empathize--and she wants to help him get over his hatred of Hendrix. After all, Hendrix is like the father Jess never had. He protected her when she was alone and floundering and Jess has a strong kinship to him. 
 I'll admit, I thought this would be a Regency romance, with swashbuckling and high seas raiding. It's not. It's kinda FIGHT CLUB meets 50 SHADES with boats thrown in. I liked the slow build of the affection between Dimitri and Jess, and also her steadfast loyalty to Hendrix. Jess' relentless pursuit of understanding gets Dimitri out of revenge mode, but it's a hard battle. It's a fun read with a dash of drama and a double kidnapping that turns a meek gal into a hellcat cage fighter. Well, for a short while anyway.

 I loved it. The end. 
 Just kidding! There's so much happening in the space of the few days that the books spans. but, to sum up: 
 Charley is in a delicate condition, for the first time in her life. She's being hunted by twelve hounds from Hell, and seemingly attacked by them, yet escapes twice with barely any injuries. Meanwhile, Reyes and his Deava compatriot, Osh, are brutalized. For me, it seems there's a missing link; everybody THINKS the beasts are out to kill Charley, but I expect we will learn the opposite is true. In the effort to defend against the twelve beasts, Charley embraces even more awesome powers, leading Reyes to believe that Charley's supernaturalness isn't limited to reaping. 
 Turns out that, in addition to being the light of Reyes life, Charley is part God. And her freaktastic ability to heal the gravely injured was not a fluke. 
 And, Charley's getting to be more than a bit jealous of Reyes and the way women swoon for him. (I'd like to apologize for all the gawking, Charley, really, but you know he's too sexy for just one glance...) At the heart of this book is a semi-psycho TV reporter who dogs Reyes at every turn. Reyes, naturally, wants nothing of this attention, and is too wrapped up trying to figure out how to keep Charley safe to form the best anti-stalker strategy. 
 There was a cold case, five unsolved murders, that Charley solves in the first scene, which seemed to set the stage for further drama--but that was superseded by the current unsolved mystery: four seemingly unrelated people have written similar suicide notes and then disappeared, leaving no bodies. And, unfortunately, when their connections are made, well, it lands Reyes back to the police precinct for questioning. Not good. Especially as Reyes and Charley come across a credible prediction that Charley's due to die, and soon. 
 That's all I'm gonna say, except that this book ends with as much of an HEA as any of the others do. And, Reyes is totally gone over Charley, and I'm totally gone over Reyes, which makes for an uncomfortable love triangle, but I'm willing to suffer for at least seven or eight more books.",Mon Dec 08 03:47:37 -0800 2014,Mon Dec 08 03:48:19 -0800 2014,Mon Dec 08 03:48:19 -0800 2014,,0,0

A broken leg has him sidelined from work and staying back in his mom's ranch home as he can't quite manage the stairs to his three-flat condo in Chicago with the cast and crutches. While recuperating, Blake's mom attempts to catch Blake up on all the neighborhood gossip. Turns out, the neighbor across the street has moved, selling her home to her grandson, Castor. Like Blake, Castor is gay. And, Blake cares not a whit, because Cas was a prissy, one-upper when they were kids and time has likely only made that worse.... 
 Castor is a qualified professional, traveling the country to help upgrade Human Resources software and training new clients on its use and implementation. And, he's sick of it. Well, he's sick of traveling. He's anxious to settle down--and buying his Gram's outdated house is that first step. He's also been promoted, which means less travel. Yay! He's an active gay man, with good friends and some casual sex partners, but finding his childhood nemesis, Blake, on his doorstep, ready to add more than a coat of paint to the avocado green-era kitchen, isn't the beginning of his new settled life...or so he thinks. 
 See, Blake was told Cas wanted help refurbing his fixer-upper. And Cas? Well, he wasn't told anything. Polish mother plus Irish Grandmother. Can you hear the scheming? LET THE MATCHMAKING BEGIN! 
 These guys are really fun together. Their youth relationship still holds sway, for a bit. But, then they decide to just start over. And, they are smoking hot together. Neither expects to find love, but who can deny the fire between them. Besides, they do share some hobbies--like fishing, and watching baseball. They are fit, virile men, living across the street from each other, albeit temporarily, and they exploit the short commute from bed to bed with zeal. (Double Yay!) 
 When Cas decides to have a full remodel on his house, they are comfortable enough in what has developed between them to co-habitate Blake's Wrigleyville condo, now that Blake's cast is gone and he's back to work. In fact, these guys are looking forward to a ""trial run"" of living together. Their chemistry has been great and well, they recognize that each could be THE ONE! for the other. 
 Then, Cas's job comes crashing down. He's got to satisfy an irate client by rebuilding a whole HR platform, onsite. In Colorado. It's supposed to take 4 weeks. And he can come home for weekends. But, the weeks stretch on and job is only getting more complicated. Four weeks turns into six, and then eight, and then.... With absence stressing their fledgling relationship, can Cas and Blake make it work? 
 It's a real romance, with solid characters and fun and flirty scenes. The smexytimes? OMG. Off the scale. Blake has to learn to get over his insecurity about infidelity, and Cas has to learn work/life balance--neither of which is easy for these men. I really enjoyed watching them step out of their boundaries. And I'm glad they were able to connect, and reconnect--even if it wasn't easy. For all the ""first love"" stories out there, I do appreciate the effort of writing about mature men finding happiness. They have a lot of self-constructed hurdles to leap, which makes for a satisfying read. 
 This book brought back some characters from the first book in this series--WOOD SCREWS AND NAILS--which was really fun, and introduced us to charming new characters who will undoubtedly carry the next book.

 Adam and Giiuseppe (Joe) have been BFFs since childhood. They have lived together the past 12 years, since age 18, attended college together, and now work at the same company. Joe is gay, and out--has been since his late teens, while Adam is straight. Joe has secretly loved Adam, pretty much since he knew he loved boys. His secret dreams had long involved marrying Adam and having a family. In an attempt to separate from his straight crush and move on with his life, Joe even considered moving out. Adam has never expressed an interest romantically in Joe, until 9 weeks ago when Adam had been hit by a car and was in the hospital--doped with painkillers. Then Adam kissed Joe, spinning Joe's world off its axis. 
 Now, nine weeks later, Joe is in misery. He and Adam have had many make-outs and some surreptitious groping, but not moved into any further physical contact. Joe agonizes over the idea that Adam isn't ready for more. Perhaps, Joe thinks, Adam isn't really gay--and pushing for more will only push him away. Joe isn't sure he can deal with a life without Adam in it. 
 Thing is, Joe's misery is all on him. Adam is all in--and the rest of the story is all about Adam showing Joe just how committed he is. 
 This books is seriously touching, and has delicious smexytimes. Joe and Adam are so good together, and the emotional landscape is deep and broadly textured with sentiment and humor. I just loved.",Tue Dec 02 15:44:24 -0800 2014,Tue Dec 02 16:04:32 -0800 2014,,,0,0

She took it pretty hard, which is why she's cold to Max after moving to NYC for a job. Thing is, Nat's extended family includes Max, and Helena and Max have to interact. It's actually a sore point for Nat that Helena's so bitter. 
 Max has had bad luck in love. His first love, Maddy, got pregnant young, and suffered PPD. Then, she was negligent and it caused a horrific spine injury to Ceclia, their infant child. In the aftermath, Maddy fled, leaving young Max and his big family to care for the paralyzed Ceecee. And he does this extremely well--the whole dad-thing. But he's not ready to hand his heart over again, maybe ever....except Helena is too intriguing. 
 Helena's a physical therapist, and Max immediately catches on to how much Ceecee likes her--hopes to turn their friendship into regular therapy. It works, perhaps a little too well for both Max and Helena. Their constant interaction fans the flames of interest into an inferno of attraction. But Helena doesn't want a man to interfere with her career and Max is too wounded to step out of his celibacy. Okay. Not for long. They ""date"" sorta. 
 Of course, Max's whole family is ecstatic, and it's clear that Helena's heart is getting in too deep, but what about Max? Yup. He's a tough nut to crack. And he messes up spectacularly. Good thing he's found the exact right woman...especially when he tells her to hit the bricks.

Helios Dayspring is heir to the throne of Astrum on the planet of Arash, and yet he's also a sex slave. A war broke out between neighboring kingdoms (aided by Helios' estranged wife) and he was taken captive and sold into sexual slavery. He has no memory of his past because he was implanted with a slave chip that suppresses all his memories and controls his mood to keep him compliant. He has spent the past 5 years as a slave on the planet Warlan. 
 One evening his pimp, U'shma, takes him to a dive bar to make some gambling money. Helios catches a glimpse of a man he feels attracted to, and subtly gets his attention. Griffin is a large, formidable man, and he wins Helios's services for a night--what neither of them suspect (because Helios is required to wear the prostitutes mask and long gown) is that Griffin and Helios are both from Arash--and that Griffin was Helios' personal guard (and lover) long before the war began. 
 In the privacy of Griffin's room, however, the truth comes out. And it's a tension-filled race to get Helios back to his people, and get his memories restored. I liked this one. The world-building was interesting, and there were lots of good scenes between Griffin and Helios. 
 One complaint was the dialogue, which was thoroughly contemporary to the USA, and it drew me out of the story. I wanted it to be more majestic, I suppose. Still, it's a fun M/M Sci-fi read.

I was genuinely surprized at how well I liked this book. 
 In this dystopian future, there aren't many people left: 10,000 in the fence-protected Ozarks town of Westfall. No one knows about the rest of the world because anyone venturing out of the fence is killed (presumably). Ivy's father is the lone child of the town's founder, and his town of Westfall was seized in a police coup by the grandfather of her husband-to-be, Bishop Lattimer. Ivy has been coached throughout her life that the Lattimers are evil, and need to be deposed. Her elder sister, Callie, was originally betrothed (in the arranged marriage system of Westfall) but Bishop objected and it is now Ivy's duty--not only to marry him, but also (in accordance with her father and Callie's plans) to kill him. 
 Quick note, because of the history of nuclear war and disease, the lifespan of this world is lower, and younger procreation yields healthier babies, hence the marrying of teens with the objective of early pregnancy. Also, it's a bit of a 1950's world where the wives are strongly expected to remain home as baby incubators--something which greatly dismays the literate and curious Ivy. 
 Frankly Ivy is terrified. She has been home-schooled and rarely ever mixed with anyone, let alone boys. She can't understand why Callie was passed over; cunning Callie is petite, dark and lovely while Ivy is too tall and too awkward and too impetuous. Still, Ivy presents herself for the marriage, because to not agree to marrying is a crime in Westfall--one that carries a banishment (death) sentence. Ivy is afraid Bishop will assert himself as her husband against her will (read: rape her), and yet, he doesn't. At all. I wasn't sure if he was interested in girls, or not, for a bit there. It seems Bishop wants a real relationship with Ivy--not just a sex partner. 
 Meanwhile, Ivy has been told her entire life that President Lattimer killer her mother. Remaining with Bishop teaches her the folly of trust--her own family lied, repeatedly, in order to gain Ivy's cooperation. The more time Ivy spends with Bishop, the more she realizes that she cannot achieve her family's goals. And why should she! Vengeance is not a dish Ivy is comfortable serving--warm, hot or cold--and cold is not the way to describe her new feelings for Bishop. 
 I really enjoyed this book. I had a few qualms--it seems that Ivy and Bishop pretty much do....nothing. Unorthodox Ivy barely knows how to cook and requests a job so she doesn't have to sit around all day. Bishop is being groomed to replace his father, but he spends long hours just hiking around, lazing about in the sun. Pretty poor showing for a world where the collective number of citizens is barely twice the population of my son's high school. I can't fathom anyone being spared in terms of skill training. This seemed a glaring oversight in the world-building. I did appreciate the frank discussions of domestic violence, and the hardships of forced marriage very much. 
 The romance that blooms between Ivy and Bishop is organic and well-paced. He has no trouble calling her out for ""putting on a show"" for others, and demands her honest affection--which she is reluctant to give. How can she give her heart to a boy she is required to kill? 
 Ivy, of her own self, is an admirable character. She has real spirit and a desire to do right, no matter her familial influences. Her willingness to sacrifice for Bishop was heart-rending. I eagerly await her next adventure.

 As much as HELL AND HIGH WATER (book 1) is about Dex winning over Sloane, I think BLOOD AND THUNDER is a lot about Sloane learning to love again. And recognizing that the feelings he has toward Dex are, in fact, love. 
 Sloane Brodie is a First Gen jaguar Therian. Life has not been easy. His first shift, at age eleven, was so catastrophic he ended up institutionalized. His only friend from those years is Ash, the lion Therian and general dickhead on Destructive Delta squad. They are close, and Ash has no problems giving Sloane his unfiltered opinion, mainly because Ash only comes unfiltered. In this book we get to see many new burgeoning relationships, and understand the inner workings of this select group of law enforcement agents. 
 Potential couples to be eyeing: naturally Calvin and his tiger Therian partner, Hobbs. (I KNOW! The jokes are merciless, seriously.) But, there's also some really, really touchy-feely things happening between Ash--who is straight--and Dex's step-brother Cael, the sweet and tender cheetah Therian. All of this will likely bear fruit down the pike, but I can't help wonder who'll do the chasing... 
 As for the plot, the THIRDS teams are being led on a merry chase for the terrorist organization, Order of Andrasteia, who longs to see Therians extreme acted, if possible. Hunting down the leader is, well, daunting. He is a former Human Police a force detective, and doesn't make a whole lotta planning errors. In fact, this dude's set on hurting Sloane most heinously--by ripping Dex away, and letting Sloane suffer the grief of losing another lover. 
 In the meantime, relationships are getting complicated. Dex only wants Sloane, but can he continue with everything on the down-low? What about when Dex's ex-boyfriend stumbles onto the scene? And how can Sloane keep Dex to himself when his own Delta team--even the lesbians--would pick the suave and quirky Dex for a one-nighter in Marry, F@ck, Kill? (Poor Ash, he really got nailed in that little game!) 
 The tension is super high throughout. Sloane has lots of secrets about his recruitment to THIRDS that he wants to remain secret, but the Order seems hell-bent on revealing all it can to discredit THIRDS and the Therians, in general. There are some great tender moments, and some that are plain-out hot. While this is a continuing series, there is a complete resolution to the main plot arc. Still you kinda gotta read the series in order. Not that I'm complaining. I'm a Dex-Girl; I gotta see this one through.",Fri Nov 14 05:45:30 -0800 2014,Fri Nov 14 05:47:59 -0800 2014,,,2,0

""Therians"" resulted from genetic mutations due to a virus and the anti-viral treatment of it. They are into their third generation of procreation and have governmental rights. The action takes place in NYC and THIRDS is the joint police force comprised of equal numbers of humans and Therians. 
 Dex Daley is a detective on the Human Police Force who has just testified against his human partner for killing a Therian in cold blood. The rest of the HPF is out for Dex's blood, and he's been beaten more than once before he gets a ""promotion"". Yep. Dex Daley's going to THIRDS, he's to be the replacement partner for Agent Sloane Brodie, a jaguar Therian with a seriously bad attitude. 
 Dex is a jokester, and uber-friendly human, always willing to reach out and charm the pants of anyone (mostly men) who he contacts. His boyfriend fled after the trial, and he's not feeling a lot of lot from the Destructive Delta crew to which he's been assigned. It helps that his adoptive brother, Cael, and adoptive father, Sgt Maddox, are on the Delta team, but Dex works his own magic inserting himself. See, all the Deltas were pretty broken up losing their teammate, Gabe, but Brodie took it worst because Gabe was his lover and he feels it a betrayal to accept any replacement for him. 
 Of course, Brodie also knows that if he refuses another partner he'll be reprimanded. So he makes life tough for Dex--who basically turns the tables time and again, working his hardest and proving himself. He's smart, and funny and charming and so unlike Gabe, but there's an attraction, one which makes Brodie furious. Dex does help Brodie blow off steam (read: smexytimes) and they engage in a down-low affair. 
 Meanwhile, several upstanding HumaniTherian supporters (people who fight for equal Therian rights) are killed, and all the evidence points to a jaguar Therian. Brodie is not under suspicion, per se, but he's not comfortable with all the scrutiny. He's faced a good deal of prejudice in the press and from humans--particularly from Gabe's brother Isaac. Isaac, for his part, seems interested in Dex, and wants to ruin Brodie--which leads to a whole plot arc regarding tolerance and prejudice. 
 In fact, the book is whole lot on cooperation and clashes within the Delta squad. Dex is finally accepted, but Brodie's not sure what to do with his feelings toward Dex--and he might not have a lot of time to figure it all out once the heat gets too hot searching for the murderer and the terrorists come out to play. 
 This is a fast-paced shifter M/M romance that has a lot of great characters and a well-planned story. Dex is hysterical--a perfect blend of whimsy and intelligence. His antics are well placed to diffuse the tension and also get his Delta squad to lighten up. He's a great match for the taciturn Brodie, who is so Type A I wondered if he arranged his sock drawer by color. Watching Dex melt Brodie's reserve was so fun. I really enjoyed this and will be reading the sequel.",Wed Nov 12 13:59:39 -0800 2014,Wed Nov 12 14:00:28 -0800 2014,,,2,0

Life hasn't always been this way, however. He was rich, once. The only son of a successful investment manager. Tom's mother died when he was young, and his relationship with his dad was always more of a mentoring, rather than nurturing, one. Well, until his father was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme and Tom's silver spoon was yanked straight from his mouth. It took Tom a year to save up enough money for his college term, and he's not giving that up for anyone. 
 Reese Anders is sophomore who survived abuse last term. He was promised a single room, and is livid that a ""brutish jock"", Tom, has been assigned to share with him. Reese is out, a bit of a ""twink"" and planning to make Tom's life miserable--parading a line of sex partners and nude man posters into their room. 
 Problem is, Tom's not so put off. Seems Tom is bisexual, and strangely attracted to the hands-off spitfire, Reese. Tom has had precious little contact with anyone for nearly 18-months, not since his dad was arrested, and later tried to commit suicide, so he's basically on emotional sensory overload sharing living space with Reese. 
 Okay. There are lots of issues at play. Tom is too proud to admit he's homeless. Reese assumes he has money, because many of their fellow students are pretty well off, and Tom does nothing to dismiss this notion. Tom works really hard, studying like crazy, knowing he must make the most of this time--he may not earn enough money to pay for next semester. Reese begins to confide in Tom why he's so afraid of big guys, jocks, and Tom, in particular. It's not as (completely) horrifying as I had anticipated, but violation is violation and I'm not going to downplay it. It, nonetheless, is a big part of Reese's character, and an issue he and Tom must work through if they are to forge ahead with a relationship. 
 Of course, Tom doesn't want to be a blip on the radar anywhere. He had troubles with tabloid articles in the past--some stories having been sold from ""friends"" when he actually broke down and confided in some of them--and is intensely private, now. So, being ""out"" with Reese is a Not Gonna Do It scenario. I was a bit dismayed by Tom's rationalizations--as was Reese. 
 This story unfolds over the course of two semesters, and is completely told from Tom's POV. Tom's fear of scrutiny and Reese's unwillingness to be silenced clash, a good bit. It was great to see Tom open up, be more of a real person than a shadow-student. He and Reese are unlikely partners, but they work. I appreciated Tom's pain and embarrassment over his father's criminal activity--and how determined he was to not take help that should go to ""more deserving"" kids. One's whose parents weren't thieves. His righteousness was admirable, in that regard. I wasn't so taken with his reticence to accept his sexuality, but I think that goes along with the age. Tom's 22, and Reese's 20. 
 I got a real kick out of Tom's buddy, Cash. 
 Tom ignored Cash's staring back and forth between the two of them. 
 The struggle to wrap his brain around the sex thing was occupying most of Cash's working brain cells. 
 ""Just, why?"" He needed to talk it out. Great. ""Okay, cute dude, not my thing, but whatever floats your boat. And I guess it makes sense that a dude knows his way around a dick, so okay, I can see how that works. But your ass, man. Why you wanna go sticking something up there?"" 
 ""Does my sex life have to make sense to you? Because I am not having this conversation!"" Tom's words were muffled by the sweatshirt he dragged over his head, but he was pretty sure everyone on the hall heard that one. 
 The resolution is good. The story has real heart and some fun bits. It's also very naughty, in parts, so....yay for me! Not for the kiddos, however.",Tue Nov 11 07:48:37 -0800 2014,Tue Nov 11 08:22:23 -0800 2014,,,1,0

 SIDEKICKS is a YA romance/adventure about Scott Hutchinson, a super strong/super fast teen boy whose alter ego is Bright Boy. He is sidekick to the world's greatest superhero--Phantom Justice. And, man is his world crumbling beneath his feet! Like many combat veterans, Scott's a hero, who doesn't show it. 
 Scott/Bright Boy has reached the Age of Awareness. Though he's been a sidekick for seven years, he's just now into puberty. And, well, his uniform tights...they are TIGHT! One night, his rescue of a pretty woman leads to (gasp!) an erection--one that is captured on live TV and broadcast all over the news networks. 
 Remember, how boners in class are a big problem for normal boys? Well, poor Scott has to suffer in silence as all his classmates snicker about the Big Deal and the newscasters cracking tasteless jokes about his ""rising"" to the occasion. Even Trent (Phantom Menace) is giving him a side-eye, thinking he's a perv and telling him he better settle all that down right quick. Scott's rage and embarrassment knows no bounds, and when he's taunted by Monkeywrench at a meet-up, well, Bright Boy loses his ever-lovin' cool. He attacks, and the results? Romantic. 
 Okay, not at first, but Monkeywrench, sidekick to Dr. Chaotic (Phantom Justice's nemesis), is more than meets the eye. She, well, is gorgeous, and intelligent, and interacting with her teaches Scott that ""good"" is a label that is truly subjective. Especially when Bright Boy gets a handle on what EXACTLY Phantom Justice stands for. 
 I'm not going to ruin this one--at all--because, it is a fantastic book. It takes all the superhero tropes and twists them. I loved Scott's complete naivete. And Monkeywrench, aka Allison, is frankly a great accessory character. There is a love story here, and it's not forced. Scott has never really connected with his peers, and Allison is the first person he can be honest with regarding his life, and his dreams. And, she's tender to him in a way he absolutely needs. Plus, Scott/Bright Boy is just such a great kid. He is so pure of purpose, so incredibly self-less, and yet a bit sulky regarding his own personal life, teen readers will find him easy to connect with.",Tue Nov 11 03:46:24 -0800 2014,Tue Nov 11 03:48:17 -0800 2014,Tue Nov 11 03:48:17 -0800 2014,,0,0

 FIVE Do-It-Yourself stars! 
 You know how, sometimes, you read a book and the second it ends you want to start over? That giggly bubble of happiness is bursting in your chest and you can't believe it all turned out...perfectly? 
 That's me right now. 
 I've read some other Piper Vaughn books, and loved the close relationships the men built against tough odds, but this one just GOT me. 
 Aaron is in 37, a hardworking contractor from Chicago's suburbs. He's gay, but not OUT to his family, and especially not to his college-aged son, Julian. Aaron was a teen, trying to figure out his sexuality by messing around with his friend Carrie when she got pregnant. His parents took her in, and they've had a good life--though Carrie married another man who has been a great stepfather to Julian. 
 Needing help rehabbing his parents' lake house in Lake Geneva, WI, Aaron asks Julian to spend the summer there--and earn a bit of cash. Julian agrees, and enlists his best friend and roommate, Malachi, for the task. 
 Malachi is an out gay 21 y/o man. He's Brazilian and a dedicated worker, aspiring to become a teacher. For years he's learned carpentry from his own father, so this summer job is perfect. Problem? Well, Malachi thinks Aaron's pretty perfect, too. See, Malachi's seriously into older men, and continually working around Aaron's big, toned body is just the spark to light Malachi's fire. 
 The two men recognize the value of their friendship, comradery and enjoy working together, but the sexual tension is fierce. It doesn't help that Julian's soon sulky and then shirking outright. Aaron's upset over the friction between himself and Julian, and finally succumbs to Malachi's desire to soothe him. 
 It's eReader-melting, quite honestly. Well, until Julian arrives at a most INOPPORTUNE moment. Ahem. Catching a full-on 'drilling' session between father and friend wasn't on his To-Do List. Ever. 
 There's lots of hurt feelings, embarrassment and apologies, but at the end, oh the end!, it's an HEA to make the most curmudgeonly smile. For real! *swoon*",Fri Nov 07 07:28:01 -0800 2014,Fri Nov 07 07:47:42 -0800 2014,,,3,0

 Just when we think Grace is going to get her HEA, she doesn't. She falls into a crushing depression--and who could blame her? She just survived a maniac kidnapper who was willing to kill her rather than let any other man have her. Sure, Vaughn scooped her up and carried her away on his Leer jet, but that kinda stress will mess with a girl's brain! 
 Still, Vaughn has his own battles to fight. He's desperately in love with Grace, and her suffering is killing him. Plus, he's got tabloid editors blackmailing him to keep his (and Grace's) dirty business out of the papers. Meanwhile, Grace is jetting off to Colorado without even TELLING him! Ugh. 
 Thing is, while Vaughn might be a soiled prince, I was so glad to see Grace dust herself off and fight her own battles. Not that she hasn't before, but this time she took some serious steps to not only survive, but heal. Her life sure hasn't been easy, but she knows she's made it through some really bad stuff, and she's strong enough to absolve herself from the guilt of surviving a madman's murderous lust. 
 In the process of reconnecting, Grace learns she's got a whole new family to begin with Vaughn, and the prospect is less daunting than she ever dreamed. If only she could remember their wedding! 
 I was seriously terrified that this book wouldn't end right. That there might be a GOTCHA! cliffhanger that would freak me right out, but it ended so right I got to the last line and sighed. Said a little, ""Awesome!"" aloud and felt my heart flutter. And that's usually a signal that I'd gotten too wrapped up in a story and forgot to eat in time to stave off a hypoglycemic attack. 
 So, thanks Julie, for nearly killing me with this serial. You, Vaughn and Grace gave me a great ride.

What we learn is this prototype is a guidance valve, for use in transmission across the aetherosphere. And, it had been created by the parents of Sophronia's dearest friends, Dimity and Pillover. 
 This tale brings Mlle. Geraldine's floating Finishing School into London--along with the company of ten male students from Bunsen's School of Evil Geniuses, among them Pillover and Lord Felix Mersey who is quite taken with Sophronia. 
 Attempts to kidnap Dimity are dashed by Sophronia's quick thinking and incomplete training, but Sophronia knows she must learn whom is behind the attempts, in order to keep her dear friend safe. Also, the cause of their mission--observation of a transchannel trip through the aetherosphere---seems to be far outside the realm of normal intelligencer behavior. It seems there is a covert test planned, one that may cause great harm to Sophronia's favorite vampire professor. 
 In unraveling the conspiracy, Sophronia must keep her wits and seek alliances with old friends and new acquaintance--even dandy vampires riding about the London scene. Sophronia's uncanny ability to spy, scheme and escape are put to the test when Dimity and Pillover are finally napped. But, can she apply her training to remover herself from the sticky business of finding herself caught between two suitors--especially those who do not suit? In the end, Sophronia discredits one teacher, nearly gets another murdered, and learns to accept that sometimes her schemes will force her to employ--gasp!--a dandy gentleman's attire. 
 Oh, and it seems Sophronia's being courted. By more than one powerful man. With all the mayhem and gore, this book's heavy on the espionage and light on the romance, though the book seems decidedly more YA than the first one in the series (which I would suggest is Tween). The pace is blistering and the language is humorous and fascinating. I love the period speech, and the nuances of manners, how they are used to advantage by these intelligencing women. Lord Mersey will be a problem, no doubt, going forward, but so will Sophronia's ""friendship"" with Soap, the black sootie. Looking forward to the next adventure.

 Jasper ""Jazz"" Jones is a 24 y/o out gay man in Boston. He dropped out of high school when he was devastated by a one-sided ""relationship"" with a fellow student, Dean. At 14, Jazz knew nothing but his infatuation with Dean, a 16 y/o popular boy. Jazz was undersized, but pretty. He and Dean became friendly and often played guitar together, writing songs, even. 
 Then, this friendship turned physical. Dean began having intercourse with Jazz, on the super-down-low. Translation: Dean would sneak up on Jazz at random times in school, corner him when he was alone, and have sex with him--without any further exchange of affection. Then, one day, Dean disappeared. Distraught, Jazz searched for him, fruitlessly. COnfused and abandoned, Jazz turned to drinking and drugs, failed/dropped out of high school and lived on the streets until he was taken in by a friend's family. He still has little to do with his own parents who are probably more disappointed by his lack of education than his sexual orientation. 
 These days, Jazz is happy. He's clean of drugs, and has a great group of gay friends on which to depend. He's unable to commit to a relationship however, and makes just enough cash-money as a temp employee at bars and as a street artist to subsist. In one of his cash jobs, Jazz is to photograph the rock band, BLACK HURRICANE, for his friend Eric's magazine. Unfortunately, Dean is the lead signer of BLACK HURRICANE. 
 Dean has recently been outed as a gay man, which hasn't been great for his band's reputation. Still dealing with the fallout, the band is returning to Dean's hometown--Boston, and there's one person with whom he'd like to connect: Jasper. Turns out, Dean had been regularly abused by his father for his homosexuality--and had been sent to his aunt's home in Cali when he didn't conform. From there he ran away and later joined his band. For years he searched for Jasper, finding nothing, but now that he discovers Jazz at the press conference his wooing is nothing short of ridiculously romantic. 
 OKAY! So, Jazz is loathe to accept any of Dean's overtures. Burned a million times in high school, he's not willing to put his hands near the flame again. Dean is rather relentless--and his manager dangles a $30,000 carrot in Jazz's face, just to get him to spend some time with the disgraced Dean. 
 This is a real roller coaster of a read. Jazz is so sympathetic, and so earnest in his desire to avoid falling into Dean's orbit. I totally related to him simultaneously loving and hating Dean. And, Dean is so incredibly charming. His affection seems so genuine, and the details he remembers from their time spent all those years ago--it's like they were separated soul mates. Pretty much because they were. 
 Their reconnection story is intense--lots of amazing near-misses and sexual tension that pours from the page. There are some passing glances at physicality, and then total connection in the overwhelming way that Jazz remembers from their first time around. 
 Of course, it's gonna be rockier now. And, it really is. Jazz doesn't understand the depth of Dean's affection, but he also doesn't know how integral he is to BLACK HURRICANES's revitalization, or to what length the PR machine will go (had gone) to ensure Dean and Jazz re-coupled. 
 I was glad to see Jazz come to terms with his feelings for Dean, not once, but twice. And, I was REALLY glad that Dean was worth every ounce of Jazz's affection. This is a quality contemporary gay romance. 
 The story is told from Jazz's POV and we get a seriously good look at his group of friends--who are all interesting and fun to know. This book is the third in the Boston Boys series, but I didn't feel that I missed anything in reading this one--so it is fully capable of standing alone. If anything, I'm intrigued to read about the previous two books int he series because I think they relate the connection stories of Jazz's friends.",Sun Nov 02 17:11:24 -0800 2014,Sun Nov 02 17:46:55 -0800 2014,Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 -0700 2014,,2,3

In book one, UNBREAKABLE, they were right on the cusp of killing Andras--when, unfortunately, they set it free. Yeah. And he's been wreaking havoc and killing people for the last several weeks. 
 Okay, so, where UNBREAKABLE left off, the MC, Kennedy had been injured in her escape from the scene when Andras came through to the earthly plane. She and four other teens--Jared, Lukas, Alara and Priest--had banded together because each believed the other part of a mystical Legion of the Black Dove sect. Jared and Lukas are twin brothers who sought the other members out based on documents their father had left behind. Turns out, assembling those documents had actually led Andras to each Legion member, and killed them, which is how Jared and Lukas lost their father and uncle, and Alara lost her grandma, and Priest lost his grandfather, and Kennedy lost her mother--all in one single night. The listing of their names...and it's Jared's biggest secret shame--he wrote the list. 
 Kennedy, for her part is despondent. She thought she'd become a Legion member when she exorcised her first ghost, but that didn't happen--unlike all the other Legion members, Kennedy didn't receive her Mark, an insignia handed down to the next Chosen in a family. Unmarked, she recognizes her folly--she was never meant to join them, and she feels utterly alone now that her mother is dead. Her father disappeared years ago, and her aunt has just dumped her into a reform school. 
 Haunted by news reports of atrocities no one can explain and gruesome nightmares, both courtesy of Andras, Kennedy recognizes that each day a girl who closely resembles her goes missing. Is Andras hunting her? It seems so, which is why she runs the second Jared and the rest of the Legion turn up at her school. Safety in numbers even if she isn't one of them. 
 But their news, of her missing, distant aunt, gets her back on board. The hunt is on for the fifth Legion member, and now it's about fixing the mess she made. Of course, this ghost/demon story is fraught with death and destruction. Kennedy's poised to lose the only people she can trust, and gain some very unsettling allies when the Illuminati come to call. 
 Andras is on the prowl, and it's clear he wants to possess Kennedy. She's got some skills in the demon wrangling arena, thanks to her training in UNBREAKABLE, but Andras is too powerful for her. Plus, nobody told her he could jump from person to person like a vengeful louse. No, possession seems a breath away, when Andras targets the one person left whom Kennedy loves in this world. 
 The revelation of Jared's mistake sends shock waves through the Legion, just as they need to gather closer--to save one of their own, but Kennedy is determined to fix all her mistakes, and she's got the brains to get the job done right. 
 Well, I assume so. Because it looks like the final resolution is gonna happen NEXT BOOK. Stay tuned, peeps! 
 As far the book goes, it was an interesting read. It gets a bit explain-y, trying to link all the moving parts together. Turns out Kennedy's mom wasn't such a great gal, and her dad left for (albeit crappy) reasons connected to Legion and the Illuminati--organizations which have for centuries been diametrically opposed as this book purports. It felt a bit deus ex machina when the Illuminati swept in to clean up the Andras mess, but there was still lots of time in the story. Time to go on and explain. In the end, we're left with a demon in chains, another on the loose, with Legion members splitting and Illuminati men hunting. Oh, and a reconnection of the parental-kind in the offing. It fell a bit flat for me. I supposed I should have felt tense, but all throughout I knew this story wouldn't end here, so the urgency wasn't as strong as I would have liked. 
 It's still a good read. And safe for kids because, instead of kissing and sex, there's killing and horror. It is a perfect Halloween read, however. And, I'm sure I'll get book 3 when it comes out.

Many of the stories are of active duty professional soldiers, in all branches of the military, but there are some with retired veterans, as well. 
 First Connection stories: 
 LA Witt, EM Lynley, Kiera Andrews, and Lucy Felthouse all offer stories of first connection between men active in duty with fellow soldiers. Witt's FLIGHT RISK showcases two gay airmen: Pilot Bennett McKinley and RIO Aaron Austin as they begin a tenuous partnership. Aaron had a bad ejection a few years back, and still suffers the pain of severe spine trauma. He's been interested in Bennett for a long time, but afraid to commit to anything with the state of his injury--and the requirement of no pain meds within 72 hours of flight time. Bennett wants more than a hook-up, but will Aaron be fit for that kind of duty? (Spoiler: yes.) 
 Lynley's IRRESISTIBLE FORCES Army Ranger Brody Mitchell is retrieving three fellow Rangers being held captive by Taliban forces. How could he know that one of them was Logan Flynn, his Battle Buddy in Ranger school? Brody harbored more than friendship back then--but can they connect now? Logan is devastated by the loss of his fellow Rangers--and reconnecting with Brody, the man who lives in his fantasies, is earth-shattering too. As Logan recovers from his physical and emotional injuries Brody helps, and then pulls back, afraid he'll out himself. Even in a post-DADT army, it's dangerous to be gay. On leave, however, their connection rekindles and it's steamy, not just because of the bathhouse... 
 Andrews' ARCTIC FIRE homes in on national guard activities in Canada. Captain Jack Turner suffers for the deceit he made which killed his fellow soldier and lover in Iraq. On assignment to inspect the Norther Rqngers back inCanada, he meets Ranger Kin Carsen, an Inuk man who is proud of his heritage, even if he knows his family would reject him for his sexuality. On a scouting trip to tour the Artic Station, a blizzard descends trapping these strangers in a cocoon of sensuality. Kin reaches out for the connection he'd denied himself for years--and the result is a more fulfilling experience than he could have wished for. 
 Felthouse's DESERT HEAT gives us British Army Captain Hugh Wilkes, wrapping up operations in Afghanistan and his translator, Rustam Balkhi, an Afghan native who put his college education in England on hold to help build peace in his homeland. The attraction is fierce, but the mission is imperative--get out safely. This may be easier said than done for Balkhi; his fellow interpreters are often targets for insurgents for assisting the ""Infidels."" While both Wilkes and Balkhi struggle to keep their desires in check, the connection they make is too overwhelming. It's a complex pairing, and an interesting story. 
 Home, but not really... 
 Brit Blaise's STORM OUT puts PTSD-riddled John ""Cowboy"" Kale on a hero's path to saving Sam Dooley. On medical leave, Cowboy sets up a sort-of vision quest to find his center on his family's estate in Alaska, he encounters a guide battered and left for dead in a white-out. The hunters he'd led poached a musk ox from Cowboy's land--and if that doesn't get Cowboy riled, Sam's honesty about his dismal upbringing sure does. Poor Sam has been left in the cold more than once, and Cowboy's finally ready to face his fears over coming out to his family and his fellow soldiers. 
 Kerry Adrienne's CRUISE CONTROL shows hoe two men can connect in the worst of circumstances. Former soldier Blake Best struggles for acceptance in this family--well, what remains of it. His late father was a raging homophobe and his sister carries in this ignoble tradition. Shame that Blake and his sis are co-owners of Best Pharma. En route to a board meeting in Atlanta, Blake's Mazarati breaks down and the nearest service station can't repair the vehicle for days. Of course, the garage owner and chief mechanic, former airman Parker Montieth, offers to drive Blake to his meetings--wanting nothing in return. Parker had been heading to Atlanta anyway to meet some bankers for a business loan. Encountering Blake's sister's hate is more than Parker had bargained for, especially as he and Balke hadn't even share a kiss. But that unquestioned acceptance is all it takes for Blake to find the happiness he'd always lacked with a virtual stranger. 
 Life-Building Partnerships: 
 Rhi Etzweiler's BLOOD AND PEYOTE was an excellent look at post-combat frailty and the need for compassionate care. Apisi Howling and Chartreuse Beaudrou are battle buddies/mission partners. Their last mission went FUBAR and left both men in dire situations. Apisi is a First Nations man--with Medicine Man training from his tribe. When not on active duty, he seeks to return to the earth, curating natural resources projects for DNR conservation. He and Char have a deep connection, though they were never physical with each other in the field. Char goes missing one day--only to turn up in Apisi's truck. Apisi takes Char home, and they work through the pain and suffering of their losses together, with the help of some peyote, some rune and native mysticism and some well-applied TLC. 
 Anabeth Alberts' RESILIENT HEART really explores the dynamics of recovery from combat injury--both for an amputee and his teammate and partner. Xander and Mackey were lovers on the down-low since enlistment. Xander only wanted Mackey, but Mackey (being bi) was more open. On mission, their dynamics went even further closeted, but Xander's injury clarified everything for Mackey: he'd love any part of Xander which survived. As an amputee, Xander's unwilling to accept Mackey's love--he wasn't good enough whole, and he won't accept his guilt-tinged affection, now. Their struggles had such angst and guilt, and love and faith. A fantastically real story. 
 Cat Grant's THE ONE WHO CARES looks at family building in the post-combat couple. David and Josh are Navy SEALs. Well, Josh is. David was too injured in his last mission to return to active duty, so he is seeking training as a therapist--specializing in treating enlisted men with emotional issues. Josh is returning to his group and will participate in active missions. They are a married couple awaiting a child by adoption. While David struggles with his own career losses, he build a support group for soldiers in need. He assists with the local shelter for abused children of soldiers, which is how he first meets Cassie, a pregnant 19 y/o girl. Her boyfriend is enlisted, on psych leave, and is becoming more than a threat. Josh is on a mission and the escalation of violence toward Cassie sends her on the run, so David takes her in. In the end, we get a whole lot of good feels. I MAY have shed a tear on this one... 
 Kinky Missions: 
 Looking for some BDSM? CIVILIAN MASTER by Cassandra Carr and THE HOUSEBOY: INITIATION by Amelia C Gormley will not disappoint. 
 CIVILIAN MASTER: Army Ranger Clay Benson is headed home after a failed mission. He's on six weeks of forced vacay, and has it in mind to try out some of this BDSM stuff he's heard so much about. Perhaps some punishment will clear the horrors from his mind. He's also anxious to reconnect to the one person he regrets leaving behind: his BFF Flynn. How could he have suspected the ""supposedly straight"" Flynn would be the biggest Dom in a local D/s club? Or, that Flynn was gay? It's a steamy, albeit short, training for Clay--but one he doesn't forget. Especially when Flynn is so willing to keep Clay in his life...forever. 
 THE HOUSEBOY: INITIATION: Okay--THIS story is NOT for the BDSM squeamish! Bryce is eighteen and kicked out of his home for being gay. He's rescued by a sympathetic man who puts Bryce into the path of veteran Fowler Vale. Vale is willing to keep Bryce, and pay for his college education, for...nothing. Well, not nothing. Bryce has to run Vale's errands and cook meals, keep the house tidy, etc. No sex, however, is part of this arrangement. It drives the virginal Bryce a bit mad, actually. He kinda likes the idea of a Daddy. And, his fantasies, well, is XXXXX a thing, or do they stop at three X's? 'Cause I think Bryce added an extra X when he learned Vale was a Leatherman. And, I KNOW they added another X when Vale made all Bryce's fantasies come true. Holy smokes. 
 Reconnection stories: 
 HOMETOWN HERO by Sasha Devlin brings local war hero, Colin Shellford, to his longtime crush, Jeremiah ""JJ"" Josten, in the quiet Nashville suburbs. Colin has never shared his sexuality with his family or fellow soldiers. Before he enlisted, he knew his sister's gay friend, JJ, had a crush on him. JJ is a stalwart community member; always looking to help out veterans and homeless animals. He even wrote letters--weekly--to Colin while he was away from home, catching him up on all the goings-on of their community. Colin savored each and every one of those letters, plus the gossipy updates on JJ from his sister. Now retiring from active duty Colin's prepared to claim JJ as a partner. Much to JJ's complete surprise. It's a funny, touching story.

After spending months messaging in the gamesphere, they arrange to meet in person. Each man believes the other is female, based on their non-descript gaming handles. Hetero Max is looking for his soulmate, while gay Stefan is happy to gain another gal pal. 
 They are surprised to find their counterparts to be male--Stefan pleasantly so, while Max is conflicted. He'd had a bit of an attraction for ""Steffi"" as he called ""her"" in his mind, and heart. Still they enjoy their time together, clowning about at a local zoo, and both men agree to meet up later--in the games and in person. 
 They do strike up a real-life friendship; Max having a great esteem for Stefan's work in animal rescue and shelter care, while Stefan is quietly attracted to Max--and nervous about losing him as a friend if Max discovers this. Meawhile, Max is slowly (over the course of a few months) transfering his affection for the imaginary Steffi to the kind, fun, open-hearted Stefan. Max has dated women exclusively, but not with much fervor which allows the possiblity of a Gay-For-You type switch. In Max's opinion, Stefan would be the perfect mate (not just a ""mate"") if only he were female...except, their continued connection only solidifies his attraction. Much to his confusion. 
 Well, it's a well-told, mostly innocent tale of first experiences for Max and satisfaction for Stefan. I really enjoyed the Brit-speak, and the antics of Stefan's pals--they really tear Max out of his comfort zone. The public stripping scene had me in tears of laughter. These two young men make a great couple, and the story is a heartwarming read. I'd love to know them more in further reads.",Thu Oct 09 05:18:02 -0700 2014,Thu Oct 09 05:18:43 -0700 2014,,,2,0

I'm a fixer and a delver. I delve in order to fix. But, enough about me. Let's find out about Charlie. Here's what he thinks of himself: 
 Geeks are popular these days. At least, popular culture says geeks are popular. If nerds are hip, then it shouldn't be hard for me to meet a girl. 
 Results from my personal experimentation in this realm would suggest pop culture is stupid. Or it could be that my methodology is flawed. When an experiment's results are unexpected, the scientist must go back and look at the methods to determine the point at which an error occurred. I'm pretty sure I'm the error in each failed attempt at getting a girl's attention. Scientifically, I should have removed myself from the equation, but instead, I kept changing the girl. 
 My inner (and outer) geek had palpitations. Charlie is such a self-deprecating, snarky, witty narrator. I couldn't help getting sucked into his world. Especially when he encounters Charlotte. He's drawn to her infinity-shaped tattoo and even moves her hair to read the word inscribed within the loop: hope. Yes, socially-awkward Charlie accosts a stranger in Krispy Kreme to rebut the logic of her tattoo. 
 ""I wanted to apologize."" 
 ""Oh,"" she says. Her muscles relax. ""Thanks."" 
 She smells amazing. At least I think it's her and not the warm donut in her hand. Either way, I have to force myself to focus on what I was about to say. 
 ""So I'm sorry."" Now, walk away. Go, Hanson. ""But I'm afraid you're mistaken about infinity. Infinity is quantifiable. Hope is immeasurable."" 
 Her expression shifts, like Tony Stark slipping into his Iron Man mask. She shakes her arm free from my slack grip. ""So if it can't be measured, I shouldn't count on it? That's bleak, man. Very bleak."" 
 She turns and pushes through the door. 
 Quite the auspicious meet-cute. Charlie does manage to salvage his lackluster first impression when he returns home from school to find Charlotte is his sister Becca's new friend. And, he doesn't want to mess that up because anxiety-riddled Becca has had bad luck with friends... 
 In fifteen years she's had three. One moved away when she was eight. The other two were imaginary. I am calculating the statistical improbability of Becca choosing this girl--of all the girls in our town, this beautiful, tattooed girl--to be her friend. 
 And, as it turns out, Charlotte is the younger sister of Charlie's new English teacher, Ms. Finch--sworn target of all the brainiac budding scientists at his private gifted math/science academy high school. When Charlotte learns Charlie is in her class, Charlotte prods Charlie and his buds to make class as difficult as possible for Ms. Finch. Because, well, that will mean her overachieving sister will get so distracted devising creative reading and writing projects that she won't have time to worry about Charlotte's failing health. 
 Yeah. Did I neglect to mention that Charlotte's ill? Like REALLY REALLY ill? Big C ill? Because Charlotte actually neglects to mention it to Charlie--who is steadily falling arse-over-teakettle in swoon for her. Not that I blame her--her life is in turmoil and Charlie's home, family and attention give her the normalcy she can't find with her own family. 
 Lookit, I ain't gonna lie: this book is heartbreaking. It is a slow descent into the kind of literary agony that makes me count my blessings and kiss my kids good night--even my almost-legal teen who fights my authority like a starving dog over a bone. Ms. Finch is desperate to convince Charlotte to try just one more clinical trial. Charlotte is resisting--and Charlie's caught between them. In the months that he spends with Charlotte he is thoroughly smitten, and thoroughly cowardly. He fears breaking up his sister's friendship. He fears falling for a girl he (rightfully) believes is dying. He fears NOT loving a girl he loves. Is it really worse to never love than to love and lose, after all? He's not sure. 
 All the Shakespeare and To Kill A Mockingbird he's being force-fed in English are worming into Charlie's brain, however, weakening his logical desire to avoid avoid avoid this doomed entanglement. And, his BF Greta has some great counsel: 
 ""I'm scared,"" I say to the carpet. Being left behind will break me. Of this, I am sure. ""How am I supposed to fall in love with a girl when I know she's going to break my heart?"" 
 ""Hey,"" Greta says, her voice sharp enough to pull my eyes back up to hers. Maybe that wasn't pity. ""You're stronger than you think. If you want to fall in love, then fall."" 
 So, he does. It's a bit A WALK TO REMEMBER, but hell--that tore the heart right from my chest in the best worst way. And, I loved this tale. Charlie is terrifically human, and scientific, and viciously funny, and honest. You can guess the end, but you can't imagine the journey. Like real life, this book is all about the journey. It is a trip worth taking.",Sat Oct 04 19:55:44 -0700 2014,Wed Oct 08 19:43:58 -0700 2014,Tue Oct 07 00:00:00 -0700 2014,Sat Oct 04 00:00:00 -0700 2014,1,0

 K. So. Sometimes a book just fills my head and my heart and makes songs on the radio speak to me in a new way because I'm thinking of this story. 
 That's is exactly how I felt about this book. 
 First, I was sure that Rikker and Graham were going to be buried by their FLAWS 
 [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3D-B...] 
 They seriously made me feel the hole in my soul. Rikker is a gay athlete--he survived a hate beating as a teen, and being shipped off to his grandmother's care after coming out, but reuniting with his first love, Graham, might just kill him. Five years have passed and, while Rikker's physical wounds have healed, he's still emotionally scarred by Graham's abandonment. 
 He's a great hockey player and a newly transferred student at Harkness ready to hit the ice. Despite being a transfer, Rikker is not subject to a yearlong suspension of play--because his previous coach violated the non-discrimination clause kicked him off the team when he was outed. 
 In order to avoid all the drama, Rikker reveals his orientation at the outset, and is subject to casual and overt homophobia--as well as some GREAT teammate support. Except, the one teammate he wishes to be there for him, well, won't: Graham. 
 Graham is so deep in the closet he might be able to sit tea with Mr. Tumnus. He is attracted to men, and denies this at every turn. He seeks out women, always under the influence of alcohol. To hear his thoughts, when experiencing the slights and slams of Rikker--both direct and indirect only cements in Graham's head what a coward he is. 
 People like Big-D have it wrong. They think that the gay guy is going to be the one who's slowly soaping up his dick, watching you shampoo. But that's not how it works in a varsity locker room on planet Earth. The gay guy is the one who discreetly goes about his business, showering quickly and then getting the hell out of there. He puts his underwear on when his skin is still damp, even though it will stick up his ass crack for the rest of the night. 
 He isn't staring at you, and he'd rather eat broken glass than sport some wood in the locker room. 
 Still, Graham simmers with attraction for Rikker, and uses lots (and LOTS) of alcohol to quell it. Rikker himself can't let go of the affection he held for his once best friend (and first love) even as he expects the taciturn Graham hates him, now. Imagine his surprised delight when Graham lets his defense shields slip...only to have them nearly discovered. 
 With shaking hands, he stumbled into his jeans. 
 I pulled the blanket up from the foot of the bed, mostly covering myself. And I watched a freaked-out Graham prepare for a hasty exit from my room. I could almost hear the worry loop trailing around inside his head. Never should have done that. Never should have done that. 
 Whatever. If he wanted to freak out and run away after hooking up with me, that was his loss. That's what I was going to tell myself, anyway. What's one more bruise on a battered heart? Mine probably already looked like a veteran NHL player's face. 
 Before the door closed on him, he said one word to me. ""Sorry."" 
 I was tired of hearing that word from him. 
 On the campus Rikker is mostly a pariah. He keeps to himself, attending classes and team events/practices only. He eats alone, and lives in a single room in a dorm filled with foreign students to whom he cannot relate. He longs for connection, and after one drunken hook-up he reaches out for Graham again, and Graham reaches back--only when it's a clandestine meeting, however. And Rikker accepts this--because, well... 
 In the dark, he studied me. ""Rik,"" he whispered. ""I had fun tonight."" 
 ""Me too, G."" 
 He moved then, hitching across the seat to reach me. ""One more,"" he breathed. ""For old time's sake."" Then he turned my face toward his, capturing my mouth in a kiss. 
 Stupid or not, I just went with it. If you stripped away all the confusion and the old heartaches, I'd had an almost perfect day. And this right here was pretty much all I'd ever wanted from Graham. I wanted his friendship, and then I wanted him to reach for me at the end of the night. So for those few minutes, I had everything. 
 Yeah. I got super melty over this book. The first loves. The separations. The reconnection and healing of wounds long scabbed over. The comic relief! Oh, I think we all needs a ""Skippy"" in our lives. He's Rikker's effeminate ex who's known for spouting his opinion, getting his way, and wearing t-shirts with outrageous slogans like 
 Power Bottoms for Jesus 
 . I loved him. And, of course there's a girl with a Graham-crush who's gonna get hurt..a bit. But, she takes it all well. 
 Hearing Milky Chance croon ""I want you by my side/ so that I never feel alone again"" and lament the lost years of affection due to the actions of others...well, I was glad Rikker and Graham got a Stolen Dance with each other... 
 [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7yDE...] 
 The anxiety factor is tremendous. I couldn't fault Graham for his closet-case antics. He'd seen the worst of homophobia up close and personal, and never recovered. Rikker helped Graham to see the better side of coming out--in some ways. It wasn't easy for Rikker by any stretch. The media attention wasn't pleasant, and Graham certainly didn't want such a spotlight on his love life. 
 By the end, I swear, I was hearing OneRepublic banging their drums in my brain and I was drinking the sweet, sweet nectar of a satisfying read where the Love [never] Runs Out. 
 [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OWj0...] 
 This was a fave book for me--gay, straight, erotic, whatever. It's a powerful read and handles homophobia, closet-cases, unintentional outing, isolation, and sports in such a commanding way. There is little sex, but when it's there it is amazingly rendered in the emotional context of the story. I hoped so hard for these two men to find their path together, and I think the arrangement they contrive at the end is more HEA than Happy For Now. (Well, I HOPE it is!)",Thu Oct 02 04:11:15 -0700 2014,Wed Oct 15 09:13:36 -0700 2014,Wed Oct 01 00:00:00 -0700 2014,,9,0

 Sybilla is a 16 y/o girl in Melbourne, AU. She and dozens of her classmates are embarking on a 9 week term in the ""wild""--okay, really. They are being sent for classes in a mountain retreat where they are expected to be rather self-sufficient, living in a cabin with classmates and prepping food, doing outdoor education classes, taking required hikes, having campouts. It's the opposite of Sybilla's strength--she's not fit, per se. 
 Just before going, Sybilla is noticed by a popular boy--Ben. This coincides with a bit of modelling Sybilla did for a perfume advertisement that gains her some popularity. See, Sybilla is an ugly-duckling-turned-swan, and her BFF Holly is all too happy to cash in on Sybilla's new social status. Holly, Sybilla, Ben and Michael (Sybilla's other BFF) are all due on the trip together. Michael is hopelessly smitten with Sybilla, though she is oblivious. He is quirky and (plain-out) weird--but Sybilla knows she is a stable presence in his life and wishes to maintain their friendship. 
 Louisa (Lou) has been suffering severe depression since her boyfriend died in a bike accident. She hasn't attended school in a year, and her mothers decide a change of scenery is in order--so they enroll her at the mountain school. She is the newcomer, the outsider--and that suits her fine as she has no desire to connect with anyone again. Slowly, Lou reveals her anguish and experiences into her journal. 
 The book alternates between the POV of Sybilla, who is trying to figure out who she is and how to deal with a popular boyfriend and conniving bestie, and Lou who endeavors to shut everyone out, and ends up failing. 
 We get to see a lot of Michael through his conversations with Lou. Lou is the dispassionate observer, witnessing Holly's machinations and Sybilla's confusion. She keeps her distance until Holly reaches levels of viciousness that cannot be tolerated. And then, she picks up the pieces of both Michael and Sybilla. 
 It's a bit of an angsty read, with some clandestine sneak-offs and the (seemingly) inevitable showdown between lust and sense. I believe this was portrayed with realism and honesty, and the manner in which both Ben and Sybilla handle themselves and their relationship felt real--and at a teen level. Nothing is glorified. 
 The end is lovely storytelling, with the ""villain"" getting a comeuppance in a way that satisfies without being horribly humiliating. 
 While this book is written from the POV of two Aussie gals, the language is accessible to American teens. The format, grammar and diction conform to American English standards, and the use of Aussie/Brit slang is next to absent. 
 Most of Lou's chapters are very short--half a page or less--as this is her journal. As the story progresses and she begins to engage with her peers, the chapter length increases--including vignettes of the people she observes, until she is fully-engaged with her grief and can move through it. It is an interesting juxtaposition from Sybilla's chapters which hold plenty of social interactions, and little contextual understanding on her part. 
 It takes a while for Sybilla to find the strength within her to grow past the passive girl/friend/girlfriend that she has always been, but she is better for it and happier with her newer, stronger relationships. She weathers betrayal well, and her confrontations had the same understated heat that Sybilla embodied, so no fireworks, but clear demarcations bounding new friendships from old. 
 I did enjoy this book. I liked the backdrop of the camp, and the metaphors for adulthood that it engendered. I liked how the students struggled to be nicer people--knowing that they had little choice in their living arrangements and had to devise creative ways to release stress in the face of 24/7 camp companionship. Some, like Ben and Michael, take to long-distance runs. Lou has her journal, Sybilla has, well, nothing, though she does invest in some new friendships, which was healthy.

 It's not even a like story, really. 
 What it is is a GREAT story. 
 This book is set in an alternate universe where slavery is legal worldwide. It is otherwise set in contemporary NYC. 
 Daniel is a slave. He's also a celebrity news anchor. His network bought him at age 11 and he's been a faithful slave, reporting the news for NewWorld Media for years now. Unfortunately NewWorld is struggling financially and they've decided to lease out some of their commerical properties--like Daniel--to buyers overnight and on weekends. Daniel's being prostituted out for an annual rental to one buyer, at 6 million dollars. And, he's terrified. 
 See, slaves like Daniel are communally housed, but not allowed any physical relationships. His only experience with sex was being raped by men as a child. He had a clandestine ""lover"" with whom he shared a few trysts, but no penetrative sex. And, Daniel's worst fears are realized when he enters his new master's home--he's been leased to a man. Okay, it gets worse: the man who is now his master, Carl, is a talk show host on a competitor network. Yikes. 
 Carl has longed for Daniel for years. Aroused by Daniel's physical beauty, and his intellectual persona on TV, Carl expected a partner to share his empty nights with witty repartee and mutual passion. Daniel isn't sure what to do--he's essentially a virgin, and can't read Carl's mixed signals. 
 If Carl ordered Daniel to have sex with him, Daniel would have submitted, but Carl never does that. No, he treats Daniel like a Freeman, which only confuses Daniel more. Carl wants a willing partner, and Daniel is unwilling. It, honestly, is a complete failure to communicate, but the end result is Daniel receiving ""training"" in his new role as a pleasure slave that is unconscionable to Carl, Daniel and the reader. 
 Okay, so I'm gonna say, this is the only time I've read a rape and felt so incredibly visceral about it. The absolute clinical and violent manner in which Daniel was coerced into sex was so distressing and so riveting. I kept hoping against hope that someone would step in, that Daniel would not be harmed. It was frightening, and yet I could only see the story unfolding in this way. 
 Daniel's plight called to the fore the political injustice of this fictional world--and gave context in the inequality of our actual world. So many millions of people are either legally (fictional) or financially (real world) subservient that the choice to engage--or not to engage--in sexual relations is not always within one's power. It was a harrowing, honest, and enlightening experience for me. Other reviews highlight this as well. 
 Carl is a terrible master, not because he is violent or coercive--because he is weak. He has no interest in ordering around a slave; he really doesn't like being a slave owner. His two other slaves are virtually autonomous, with Carl having no desire to reprimand them--not that they act out. In fact, Daniel doesn't act out--he just isn't sexually interested and refuses to please if he isn't ordered. Well, at least until he's ""trained"". After surviving that experience he's ready to serve Carl as often as possible, in whatever way necessary, to prevent any further training. 
 Carl learns the consequences for his folly in renting Daniel, and makes amends in the best way that he can. He is a truly good man, and didn't understand how his disatisfaction with Daniel would manifest as torture. 
 I was particularly touched when Daniel reflects on the difference in emotional attitudes between slaves and Freemen. A Freeman, like Carl, can have/give love to Daniel--because he has autonomy. 
 On the other hand, Daniel could have respect, or even affection, for Carl, but he didn't feel free to love him. The power imbalance was too great to have equal footing in something so visceral as love. Daniel appreciates that he always faces the risk of being sold to someone else, so he guards his love carefully to ensure he's not emotionally damaged by what amounts to a commercial transaction. 
 It was a very powerful commentary, and one I probably didn't even fully appreciate--regardless of how moved I felt by it. There are some tender moments in this book, but it isn't a tender tale. As I said, it's not a love story. I was glad to see that Daniel was satisfied in the end. That he was safe and protected. This book will stay with me long after I expect.

 SILLY ME!!!! 
 This is a first-class, snappy, romantic comedy that is long on sexual tension and short on time between laughs. I loved every second of it. 
 Caroline is a no-nonsense woman. She takes her life, and her job, seriously. She works hard and plays a bit, having two great friends from college with whom she regularly connects. As an interior designer, NOT decorator, she is moving up, taking on bigger clients and adores her boss--another career-focused woman. Caroline is also single. And, semi-okay with that. She had a rather long term thing previously, with a man who wanted her to change too much, to adapt her life to suit his career/life goals, so she walked away. In the interim a sloppy one-night fling destroyed her O--got it lost somewhere out in the Hinterland, always just out of reach. 
 Hearing the orgasmic caterwauling and banging of her sexually-gifted neighbor's headboard through their adjoining wall (night after night) is wearing down Caroline's patience, however. One night the motion of his ocean actually brings down a piece of art, onto Caroline's head. She tears into him, and the meet-cute is set. 
 Simon is a good guy. Sure he has a few regular gals with whom he has some no-strings sex, but it's all open. The gals know about each other, and are comfortable with their casual arrangements. The altercation between Caroline and Simon only becomes more interesting when they meet in person, again, at the home of mutual friends. Inconveniently, Simon's two best buds seem smitten with Caroline's BFFs. They begin a dating circle, alternately inviting either Simon or Caroline out as fifth wheel. 
 Realizing the awkwardness of their position, Caroline and Simon strike a tentative truce, cemented with baked goods. Simon was orphaned in his teens and craves home-baked treats--while Caroline bakes away her frustration. The truce soon morphs into a friendship. Caroline has no interest in joining Simon's harem, even if he is very attractive. It seems Simon, however, may be changing his ways. One after another of his regular visits seem to be off-schedule. 
 Caroline isn't sure, but the idea that Simon is interested in a real relationship is certainly appealing to her, and her girly bits. Especially as Simon is a proven O finder. It takes him quite a while, however, and the journey is delicious. 
 I liked Caroline. She was sexy and sardonic. She talked to her cat as if he was a person. She has a good heart and a lot of respect for herself. At first, she believes Simon to be a shameless womanizer, but learns that he isn't. He's more of an opportunist, I'd say, having discreet relations with a few friends, for mutual satisfaction. When Caroline really gets to know him, she finds him to be very charming, and kind, and someone she honestly fears becoming intimate with, unwilling to upset their friendship. Caroline is a brave lass, however, and Simon can be irresistible, at times. Particularly when he's got the right bait--a luxury trip planned to a destination Caroline longs to visit. 
 Lookit. This book is really something. If you enjoy romantic comedy, baking, cats with strong personalities, humorous plot twists and/or people slowly falling for each other in a very real way, this book won't let you down. It has some heat, but it won't melt your kindle. And, when the physicality develops, it's all long, long after a true bond has been forged. I was glad I started it on a night the hubs was out-of-town because I couldn't stop reading and spent half the night snortling with suppressed laughter trying not to wake my toddler in the next room. I had to power nap through the wee hours just so I could race to the finish.",Mon Sep 22 06:04:38 -0700 2014,Mon Sep 22 06:06:41 -0700 2014,,,0,0

Brooklyn is a 27 y/o slave sold to a boxing consortium, and he's burning up the heavyweight division. Brooklyn hasn't always been a slave. He was born a freeman, and was sold into slavery following a conviction. In his free days he was a married man, a policeman in fact. A chance encounter resulted in a murder conviction, when manslaughter (or no charge) would have been the ordinary course. Brooklyn is haunted by the memory of the riot where he was dispatched and a girl died. He suffers real guilt, but as a slave his feelings do not matter. 
 He is housed in a communal living space where all his actions are controlled by armed guards, and rented out as a boy toy when he is not training or fighting. Some of his ""johns"" have been female, many male. He's not adjusting well to slave life, but channels his rage into his fighting, which helps. 
 Nathaniel rents Brooklyn one night, and learns that his experience as a slave is not always about what is taken from you. In Nathaniel's sphere, Brooklyn is cherished. Allowed what little freedom a slave can be afforded. 
 Nathaniel becomes a regular renter, and Brooklyn is able to claim a small bit of his humanity back through their encounters. Soon, Nathaniel reveals that he is interested in re-opening Brooklyn's conviction; he felt he was scapegoat--wrongfuly accused and convicted due to an abuse of power by the victim's father. Brooklyn almost can't bear to hope to escape his lot as a slave, but he does. He trains harder and harder, trying to compartmentalize his fear and mortification of slave life, and he gains even greater acclaim in his boxing. 
 Then, there's a big problem in one of Brooklyn's fights, and he freaks out. His breakdown results in a loss of his connection with Nathaniel and abuse he had never before endured in his slavery. The climax comes fast and furious, with a chance for redemption and ""freedom"" offered if he throws his big title fight. Brooklyn is a steadfast man, and his HEA is just around the bend. 
 I really enjoyed this alternate universe, legal slavery, because it served as a greater context to discuss racial relations (all Blacks in the story are slaves) and the inequality of wealth and power, and how it corrupts. Brooklyn is a good man. He is in a bad spot, and makes the absolute best of it. He does not let his situation defeat him. He does not take the ""easy"" way. He strives, and perseveres. He fights for his dignity, even when it is continually ripped from him. He endures unspeakable cruelty, and achieves his ultimate reward on his terms. 
 I am a sports fan, so the boxing milieu was amenable to me, but I don't think it was too much for an average reader to absorb. It was all very well described and the context always felt appropriate. I also enjoyed the boxing history vignettes, as I grew up in the 80's watching Sugar Ray and Mike Tyson and others find their titles, so this was a little piece of home. And the writing/language was superlative. The author notes how readers will likely balk at his ""British"" English, but for me, an Anglophile, this story could not be authentically told any other way. It kept me up way too late because I absolutely could not stop reading once I opened it. 
 The smexytimes aren't overdone, and pack a good balance of sensuality and heat. They take a while to develop, which was unexpected, and pleasant. It allowed me to really enjoy Nathaniel and not see him as another exploiter in a vile system. And, later, when he worked behind the scenes to help Brooklyn, I really grew to love him. I think Brooklyn did, too.

 Annie likes it quiet, and hates when her flighty mother drops in--as she tends to do every couple years, or so. So, she urges her dad to make the move, and NOT reveal their new address to his estranged wife. 
 Annie's dad's main job is to refine a hot-shot prospect, Jason Brody, who has a great arm, and a bad history. He's nineteen, an ex-con? (Sorta) Anywho, Annie and Jason spend a lot of time together, and Annie develops the teensiest mega-crush on the pitcher. But, she can't act on it. First, she's 17, he's 19. Second, if anything goes wrong with Jason, her dad's out of a job. Third, does it matter? You know she's going to make a play for him... 
 Here's the thing, this isn't a flitty teen romance. It gets to the seemy underside of pro sports. Annie's new BFF Lenny is the daughter of First Base. He's a playa, and his famiy is polished yet fragile. Lenny's a smart girl, but likes to cut loose, bringing Annie along for the ride. 
 Jason's a decent guy, even if he's attracted to a high school girl. Actually, one thing he really lacks in his life, a family connection, is something that he really admires in the bond between Annie and her dad. He's infatuated with the idea of being a part of a family again, ever since his mother disowned him. 
 I really enjoyed the playfulness, and the introspection. Annie is a confident character, not a hot mess. She has goals--and is extremely competitive--yet she is human. She sees the heartbreak of a teammate and makes a choice to help someone else, instead of herself. She is mature, having practically raised herself with no mom around. And, she is fierce in her love for both family, and Jason. 
 The book unfolds over the course of the baseball season--roughly five months. The feelings develop and are expressed in terms of months, not weeks, so we don't get whiplash from INSTALOVE, which is grand. Again, the characters do become intimate. In careful stages. With lots and lots of verbal communication. They make responsible, adult decisions and though Annie's dad goes a tiny bit (read: whole lot) ballistic, life works out well for all the characters. In a way that doesn't compromise the MC's ideals. 
 Yes, there are curveballs. Yes, sometimes Annie has to perform a suicide squeeze when she wants to hit a dinger. Yes, Jason is panty-melting hot--and Annie's not sure if he's capable of reading her signs. The baseball metaphors are sprinkled throughout the book like poppy seeds on a Chicago style hotdog bun, and it worked for me. (side note: this reviewer played 10 seasons of fast pitch softball and spent her youth, and adulthood, cheering on the White Sox.) I appreciated the appropriate language of the game, and how skillfully the story enfolded all aspects of baseball in a way a non-fan could still understand.

Wherever they go, he finds them. This last move takes Edie from Toronto to London. She starts a new school with the typical school issues-dorks, outcasts, bullies and the rest--and after her second day, Edie knows there is something seriously wrong. 
 Her mother doesn't return home after her first night of work. Edie is freaked out--did her mother fall in with bad elements, is she just late due to commuting...or has HE found them already? 
 Two days pass, and no mom. Edie is desperate, and takes a chance stealing PS80 (okay, that's 80 pounds, if I've got the wrong symbol) from the charity fund at school. Edie needs some cash if she's going to hunt all over London to track down he mom. 
 Problem one: another kid, Jermaine, is blamed for the theft. 
 Problem two: Jermaine knows Edie took the cash. And he's pissed. 
 Problem three: the police await Edie at her flat 
 Problem four: Edie knows nothing about traveling around London. She's been in England six days, has no contacts and no chance of doing anything remotely helpful. 
 Things are set to go really wonky, but Jermaine--school hoodlum extraordinaire--steps in. He believes Edie's story of her missing mom, and saw the cops chase her through the streets. He's pissed about the money/theft, but Edie promises to return the money and confess as soon as she locates her mom. 
 Jermaine agrees to help her in the search, and they spend two days traversing London's public transit searching her mom's last known whereabouts. They get some leads, but it's a frustrating experience. In the meantime, spending so much time together allows a connection to be made--something Edie has had little experience with considering her life on the run. They strike up a tentative friendship, and more, but the end is not rosy. 
 SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE is a book about domestic violence, living on the fringe, and (obliquely) the power of racism. It is one girl's fictional plight, but could be any of thousands of kids' life story. I felt it was, at points, a little unbelievable, but that's the tricky thing with obsession--it is hard to understand. Edie and her mother have very real fears, and a solid reason for them. I felt this was adequately translated into fiction, and think this story is an important one to tell.

 Vaughn is a man on a mission--to play with Grace in all the filthy ways he enjoys. Grace is a headstrong woman who is used to being on her own. Her parents died years ago and she's made her way independently--which makes it difficult for her to submit to Mr. Asher's sexual designs. 
 I wasn't sure I would like Vaughn much, he's domineering and prickly, but this episode brought more of his personal life into the story, and it can see how desperately he strives to control all aspects of his very public life. He's got some good points, and his lack of scruples where Grace is concerned is a bit endearing. 
 Having been public property so long, it's no surprise that Vaughn likes public sex, and he's keen to make Grace's exhibitionist and voyeuristic fantasies into reality--with explosively satisfying results. I liked how Grace held her own, regarding the contract--insisting on her own autonomy outside of the bedroom. 
 It's clear that Vaughn is getting in far deeper the he bargained for--and an affinity for Grace is growing, which I LIKE very much. Looking forward to the next episode!",Wed Sep 10 08:46:24 -0700 2014,Wed Sep 10 08:46:58 -0700 2014,,,1,0

 Hudson and Alayna are on the road to happiness, when the bottom falls out. Celia is stalking Alayna, making her crazy, and Hudson is too busy with his secret business deals to help out. He hires an extra bodyguard, and tries to connect with Alayna, but his suspicious activity is mind-bending. 
 Why is he always with the sexy financial officer from his work? Why is he traveling so much? Why can't he open up? Well, when he finally does, it's like the Great Flood of Holy Cow How Could You? 
 Yeah, Hudson is a First Class Jerk-Off. He admits to playing Alayna--at first--and it shatters her. She moves out, and attempts to move on, but she can't. She wallows. And, she investigates. Herself, Hudson, the parts of the relationship that felt ""real"" to her. Was any of it real? Can she forgive him for his weakness?

He had previously hired Alayna to pretend to be his girlfriend, a ruse to appease his alcoholic mother, but this go round they have developed feeling for each other. Hudson even asks Alayna to move in with him. 
 For his part, he thinks everything is going fine--pretty much becasue Alayna doesn't tell him what is really going on. Like, how she's meeting his friend Celia so she can dish the dirt on Hudson. Or, how the guy with a restraining order on Alayna is now blackmailing Alayna into a lucrative contract benefitting his fiance. Or, how Alayna and her boss, David, had been makeout buddies inthe past. 
 No, opening up about those things might make Hudson angry, so let's keep it all under wraps--because that never comes back to bite people int he butt. 
 Instead Alayna gets mad that Hudson wants to get rid of David, and make Alayna the manager of the nightclub he bought for her. There are so many twists in this plot, not the least of which is learning who fathered Celia's child. (I so knew it would be that guy!) And, it seems Celia's interest in Hudson is far more than friendly--in fact a gal Alayna knows claims to have proof of hteir physical relationship. The worries eat at Alayna, but Hudson stays as rock-like as ever, wanting to whisk Alayna away and work on their relationship. 
 The ride is pretty sexy, and Alayna's paranoia is spotlighted, though she doesn't get full-out obsessive. Much. I did enjoy. And, I went right on to read book three from this one.",Tue Sep 09 06:32:52 -0700 2014,Tue Sep 09 06:33:28 -0700 2014,,,0,0

Her dream is becoming a special education teacher. She keeps her grades up, striving always to do well enough to keep her scholarship and make her hardworking parents proud. The day she (and three roomies) move into their apartment, Nadia meets the man she secretly calls Hot Ginger. 
 Ty, as he is REALLY called, is a little older, twenty-four, and very much the professional man. Yes, suits and ties seems to turn Nadia on. A lot. But, Ty has something serious going on in his life--he's a single parent to his four year old son, Sam--and he's unwilling to bend his life plans, completing his college degree in architecture and being an amazing father, for anyone. Certainly not Nadia. 
 Well, at first, anyhow. 
 Thing about plans? They are made to changed. I think that's the take home message of this book: that it's okay to take risks and alter plans when life puts the right people in your life. 
 Nadia works part-time for a daycare center. When Ty needs help looking after Sam, she recommends it. Then she gets shifted into Sam's class. The two bond. And on the side, Nadia and Ty bond, too. But Ty insists on keeping his budding relationship with Nadia completely separate from Sam. They indulge in some sexy nights when Sam stays with Ty's parents, but the ""friends with benefits"" scenario isn't enough for either if them... 
 There is a breakup. There is a makeup. There are concerned parents, and drunk roomies, and faltering friendships. Secondary characters are interesting and well-written. Nadia tells this story, and she tells it well. She is direct, and fun. I loved how matter-of-fact she was about everything, and how she allowed herself to wonder if she was making the right choices with her life, without sounding whiny. 
 Her first meeting with Ty is inauspicious, at best. While trying to move her sofa upstairs, aided by Lauren, one of her three roomies, Nadia tumbles down the stairs. Ty arrives and, begrudgingly, assists the two gals. 
 ""I'm Nadia,"" I said. 
 At first he didn't say anything so she tried, ""That makes me Lauren."" 
 ""Ty,"" he said finally, like this basic introduction was akin to signing a long-term cell contract. 
 Lauren started, ""The guys will be back with drinks in a bit, off you want---"" 
 ""No, it's okay. I need to get home."" If curt was a hat, he would be wearing it with jaunty disregard for our feelings."" 
 Not a great start for these two, for sure, but the middle is very good. De-lish smexytimes for Nadia and her Hot Ginger, Ty. The separation is believable, anguish and tears, but not a sobfest. No, Nadia copes well. She's stalwart and steady, which makes her Ty's perfect match. Good thing he figures that out in the end. I very much enjoyed.

She has fought hard for this dream scrimping to make ends meet in college and living on a scholarship. See, she knows not to depend on a man; her father and grandfather didn't stick around much past the birth of their kids, and she and her mother grew up in poverty. So, there's no chance Jenna's gonna change plans for a man who'll undoubtedly just leave her when the going gets rough. 
 That's why she struggles with Jack. He's her friend-the closest male friend she's ever had-and they did the deed once, back in December. Seven months have passed, and yet, that night still holds its place in Jenna's heart. She can't deal with the tenderness Jack showed her, and they both walked away changed-not that Jenna will admit it. She doesn't want a boyfriend...ever. But, she can't stop feeling more than she wishes for Jack. 
 Jack is exasperated. With Jenna, and his family. Jenna loves him, he knows this, and he loves her-so why the heck is she being so stubborn? When the opportunity arises for Jenna to take a road trip back to New Orleans to visit her sick grandma, Jack jumps at the chance to got with her-he's needed back home, too. Seems his brother, Drew, has gone missing and it's up to Jack to ferret out the situation. 
 Jack's past was a rough one, if his scars have anything to say about it. He worked hard to keep his mother and brothers out of trouble with the gang life in their small Louisiana town, but it seems trouble found them anyway, and from the most reprehensible source possible. Jenna has a front row seat to the seedy side of Jack, and though he frets that she'll run for the hills, it is his steadfast devotion to his family-he people he loves-that causes Jenna to rethink her hardcore 'no romance' stance. 
 This is a mature read with some serious steam and occasional, okay ONE, stabbing. The characters are interesting and fun, though I sometimes got overwhelmed with all the names-between Jenna's three cousins, three sisters, grandma and mom, there were too many Lacombes to keep track of. I liked Jack a lot-outwardly, he was steady and sure even when he seriously struggled on the inside. He was kind and compassionate and unafraid to put himself out there, for the people he loved. And, he really pushed all the right buttons with Jenna. He showed her it was safe to let her control slip, once in a while. 
 The Finding Fate series interleaves with each book, giving glimpses of characters from other stories (Pixie, Daren, Kayla and Levi) as secondary characters. Nonetheless, each reads as a standalone. This is fun, quick read with a likable heroine and a lickable male lead. The smexytimes are interesting, but not overblown, with a clearly respectful tone throughout. Jack woos Jenna hard-and that makes for some delicious interactions.

See, I read a lot of contemporary erotica. This whole ""alpha male"" thing gets taken to extremes, and often the Dom/sub stuff is overblown, and rushed. I can't imagine a sensible woman ""submitting"" for spankings...etc with a man she's only just met. Which makes THOSE sort of stories ring hollow and lacking. 
 Still, I helped with the pub for Paige's newest release HUDSON, and won a copy of the book. Her Fixed trilogy was on sale, so I dove in. And, I really have enjoyed it. So much so, I'm behind on my reading for my blog, having progressed from book one through to book three in a day.... 
 Here's what drew me in: 
 Alayna is a newly graduated MBA working in an NYC nightclub. She has no plans to leave however, because she sees great things for this club, and the manager has promised her a promotion to co-manager. This way she can use her marketing savvy to raise the nightclub's profile. Only thing? The club has recently been sold, and they have no idea what the new management will be like. Alayna also has a problem with men. Her parents died in a car wreck (caused by her own father's intoxication) and she suffers severe abandonment issues. To the point that she ends up stalking men she has hooked up with, thinking they're THE ONE. She has been through therapy since the last episode, three years ago, resulted in a restraining order. 
 Hudson Pierce is a young, sexy businessman who catches Alayna'a eye--and her job, sortof. He just bought her nightclub and he has some ideas about Alayna's new role--as his ""pretend"" girlfriend. See, his parents are rich, manipulative and mean, and they are sure he should marry Celia Werner--a childhood friend and daughter of his mother's BFF. Hudson has other ideas, and other problems. He's not a very nice guy--or he wasn't. He used to manipulate women, get them to fall for him, and then callously break their hearts. It was his fave pass time, in fact, until a couple of years ago. He's sure he can't fall in love, but he doesn't want to marry Celia. He figures if he APPEARS to love Alayna, a smart, beautiful woman, his mom will back off on the Celia-front. 
 These two misguided, emotionally unstable people, Alayna and Hudson, are the most sexually charged beasts on the planet. Alayna is constantly on guard that she doesn't FALL for Hudson, double and triple checking her ""obsessive"" tendencies, while Hudson is riding a very thin line between convincing his family of his ""real"" affection and convincing himself that he doesn't love Alayna. 
 It was a very fun, sexy story, and I'll admit I immediately opened the second book FOUND IN YOU. I had feared Hudson would get all ""whips and chains"" but he didn't. This is a passionate ""vanilla"" romance. Alayna is a compassionate lead, with very real self-doubt and very approachable emotional frailty. Fun moments included Alayna's backbone of steel when speaking to Hudson's ruthless mother for the first time. 
 ""Tell me, Alayna--were you attracted to my son because of his money or his name?"" 
 Pissed didn't even begin to describe how I felt. I was seething, but still in control. Without skipping a beat, I wrapped my arm around Hudson's and answered. ""Neither. I was attracted to him because he's hot. Though, I stayed with him because he's fucking awesome in bed."" 
 Yeah, I love me a sassy heroine.",Fri Aug 29 03:49:25 -0700 2014,Fri Aug 29 03:50:15 -0700 2014,Tue Aug 26 00:00:00 -0700 2014,,0,0

 Lissette is a Parisienne, an orphan raised her whole life in Paris. She was educated and cultivated a great love of art. Moving to the rural southern Provance region of France to care for her husband's ailing grandfather, Pascal, seems like a death sentence. Or, at the very least, a great punishment. Especially when she learns he has no indoor plumbing! 
 This cultured girl soon takes to the country life-mostly out of necessity. And she very much loves her husband Andre, growing also to love Pascal. And, art. Pascal has wondrous tales of his communications with Cezanne and Pissarro, and beautiful paintings he earned in trade for the frames he built. 
 The relationship that builds between Pascal and Lisette is a balm for her loss of family, and she grieves him terribly when he passes, promising to protect the valuable paintings that are his legacy. Then the war breaks out, and Andre hides the paintings and joins the battle, leaving Lisette to care for herself the best she can in her remote locale. If you have read COLD MOUNTAIN, you may have some inkling how difficult it would be for a woman of few skills to sustain herself in the absence of a man to tend the house, or protect her, in the midst of a war, and I felt an instant connection to Lisette in this regard. She is resilient, and formidable, despite her young age. 
 She also turns society on its head, forcing her way into the ""men's world"" by visiting the cafe during the aperitif hour to listen to the wireless radio document the war unfolding around her. When the Germans occupy her village, she comes under scrutiny for her knowledge of the artistic treasures-and is accosted for their whereabouts, but she cannot give them up. Andre is gone, and with them the secret of their hiding place. 
 Through Lisette's eyes we can experience the secondary effects of war. The suspicions of ones neighbors-who are collaborators? Who are resistance?-and we gain the sense of the sacrifices all civilians made. Lack of basic supplies, staple foods, rationing of everything. Lisette even cuts her hair, sending the clippings to become the insoles of boots for the soldiers, and donates the remainder of Pascal and Andre's wardrobe for soldiers and refugees. 
 When the war ends, Lisette knows she can return to Paris, but she stays in the country, fulfilling her promise to Pascal to care for the art-by finding it. Wherever Andre hid it, she must uncover the secret. See, thousands of paintings had been destroyed by the German forces, and those Pascal had--and Andre hid--mark important artistic transitions in French art history. They are valuable not only in themselves, but in the rich history they can document. This is important to Lisette, and becomes a part of her mission, and her way to cope with so much loss in her life. There is a bit of a love story that develops, as well. It is tentative and fragile as the players involved-the war has changed everyone, not just Lisette, and yet this change has brought new poignancy to love, and finding it anew. 
 For the record, this book was recommended to me by a dear friend-and I'm so glad I found it. I really love to expand my reading, and this this quiet, period tale almost read like a movie script. I could-throughout-feel the chilling winds of the mistral, sense the fear and loneliness of Lisette, not only when Andre left her to go to war, but (spoiler warning) more so when he didn't return. 
 This story is as beautiful as the art it describes. I felt transported to southern France through Lisette's frank point-of-view, and vivid descriptions. In experiencing Lisette and Pascal and even Andre's love of art and passion for paintings in this book, I really lamented the loss of so much cultural teaching in our schools today. My children will never understand the names of these artists-nor the evocative nature of art-unless I teach them myself, and I am woefully unprepared for such a challenge having spent very little of my own youth learning about art. Still, I feel moved to learn, and share, and to 'live in a painting,' as Lisette put on her list of needs and hungers-the list which gave her the courage to go on when's he disappointments of her life almost crushed her spirit. If you like historical fiction, this book will not disappoint.",Thu Aug 28 10:06:57 -0700 2014,Thu Aug 28 10:09:33 -0700 2014,Sun Aug 24 00:00:00 -0700 2014,,0,0

Her latest mission, however, goes astray when she's apprehended at the scene by a private security agent--Jake Forsythe. Tara and Jake have history--they were childhood sweethearts/theft partners--at least until Jake left her unfulfilled on his last night before reporting to basic training. Since then, Tara's been on her own, and doing quite well. 
 Jake is a shell of a man. Wounded in battle, and scorned by his fiance, he's sure no woman will ever feel for him again--so he won't allow anyone close. Especially not Tara. She had gotten in before, and he's never quite forgotten her, but he won't let his attraction get in the way of his job. He has to figure out how she was able to get past his security protocol to steal a precious vase, and if she doesn't? Prison. 
 Thing is, neither Jake nor Tara can deal with this reunion. Tara hasn't had a steady lover in all the years Jake's been gone, and Jake hasn't been with a woman in more than a year. The passion they ignite is both fiery and familiar, with Tara's shenanigans thawing the ice in Jake's heart until all he can imagine is the life he could have had, should have had, if only he wasn't battle worn and scarred. 
 But, Tara is strong, stalwart and crafty. She knows Jake will turn her in if she doesn't comply--and yet she doesn't hold back on her affection. She won't give up her secrets, but she's not going away without getting what she also wants: to see Jake laugh with abandon before she's rotting in a jail cell. 
 I really loved Tara. She was funny, and fearless. Her heart was so open and she held her convictions so tight--there was no way she was sharing any secrets that would benefit a gangster, even if he was Jake's client. Jake, too, was stubborn, unwilling to send Tara to jail, but caught in the need to do his job--even after recognizing his client was a bad dude. 
 I had a hard time warming to Jake. At points he was really intriguing, but his control freak nature was...too much, perhaps. I found him much more interesting once Tara started breaking through his walls. Partly, at fault was Tara's innate stubbornness; Jake knew that he'd never get Tara to reveal her theiving secrets and had to really push to make her give it up--even if it totally pushed her away--knowing it was the only way to save her. 
 I appreciated having some input from Cooper Shillings, of TEMPORARILY YOURS, in here. His sound advice helped put these two double-crossed lovers back on collision course.

It was these novels, about a smart, tenacious teen girl taking on criminal masterminds that enthralled me to the point of being grounded...for reading. Yes, my father lamented that. Not that I gave him any choice; I was obsessed to the point of skipping my school work to devour one for the first (or tenth) time. 
 So, anywho, I'm a lifelong sucker for teen sleuths, which is why I loved this book. Also: Anglophile = ME!! Thus, a story of a London girl on holiday to visit her mother's sister and home town for the first time in her 16 years is pure catnip for me. 
 Here's the thing, the book didn't start out like a mystery. It started off like a girl helping her overwrought mother get over her divorce. Jess isn't bitter over her dad being a philanderer--she' bitter that he's moved on entirely, and she hopes that this extended visit to the small coastal town where her mother grew up will turn the tide of her mom's depression. Also, Jess is anxious to meet her cousins. She has no siblings and longs for a bigger family. 
 What she didn't anticipate was becoming her dead cousin Freya's doppleganger. On the drive Jess learns her resemblance to Freya is so strong, her mother opted to stay away from her niece's funeral, afraid having Jess there would be too shocking. 
 From the outset the reader knows something bad happened to Freya. (She fell off a cliff on page 5.) But, was she haunted, hunted or--maybe--pushed? The authorities, namely Jess' mum's high school sweetheart Dan Henderson, has ruled Freya's death an accident. (One reason I love British books...the actual classification was ""death by misadventure,"" which sounds a whole lot more romantic...) Yes, Inspector Henderson is quite the enigma. He's creepily over-friendly to Jess and her mum, despite being married, and he's unduly harsh on his son, Will. Will is a town pariah for confessing some nasty business to his dad years ago; he's also Freya's closest friend. Does Will know what happened that night? 
 Through the weeks of visiting and working in the idyllic locale, Jess is befriended by Darcy, Freya's best girlfriend, and hated by the town bully--Natasha. Nats has a good deal of obsessive affection for pretty-boy Ryan, and Ryan likes Jess just the same as he admired Freya. After a few altercations, Jess is concerned that her cousin was being harassed. Did Natasha bully her into suicide? 
 Few people will talk openly about Freya, thinking that each may have played a role. Will feels guilty for not being a better friend. Ryan's miserable that Freya wasn't into him, but that she paid the price of Natasha's bullying. Darcy knows she let Freya down right as she needed her most. But, still the question remains--what sort of misadventure took place on that cliff? Natasha seems a likely target for blame, and yet Inspector Henderson's admonitions to ""drop it already, or else..."" seem far too sinister for comfort. 
 While the love triangle wasn't necessary, it was certainly handy to the plot. Jess is attracted to Will, whose tap runs lukewarm most of the time. Ryan's attracted to Jess, much to Natasha's psychotic dismay. In the midst we get some interesting interplays of characters. I liked Jess. She was sharp, and determined. She saw the suffering of her cousin's family and her entire thought-process was to bring them closure. The big showdown revealed the killer--who happened to make my shortlist but wasn't top three. I loved that I was fooled, a bit. 
 Pacing wise, the book cracks along. We don't get too bogged in Jess' head. We also don't spend too much time in Love Central. Jess knows she doesn't care much beyond friendship with Ryan, Natasha's antics notwithstanding. But, Jess is sharp enough to recognize that making allies where she can will get her the info she needs to lay Freya's ghost to rest. I really enjoyed and would recommend to any lovers of YA mystery. Just a touch of romance, but not enough to turn off the younger readers.

 This M/M paranormal romance was a fun fresh read--for characters who deal with the dead. 
 Denton can see dead people--or at least their death traces, remnants of memories from their last few minutes prior to death. He's a quirky gay man who does freelance web design. Denton is a pretty free-spirited guy with a great sense of humor. 
 He sublets a friend's apartment and meets the subtly attractive neighbor, Bran, who is almost agoraphobic in his unwillingness to be in public, or meet people. Denton makes some overtures to developing a friendship, but it isn't until Bran's cat sneaks into Denton's apartment that they really connect. 
 It seems Bran is an herbalist, and a witch. He can see that Denton does more than 'see' the dead, and enlists Denton's help eradicating a malevolent spirit from a restaurant. In the process of experiencing the ghost trace, Denton inadvertently banishes the spirit altogether--it is then that Bran reveals his thought that Denton is a necromancer.... 
 But MORE importantly, Denton finally takes charge of his attraction to Bran, and the two men are very compatible--both in the professional and personal realms. Of course, Bran has a big secret that precludes his wearing of skinny jeans, and I was WONDERING when it would play a role in the bedroom--so glad it happened before the end. 
 The book is actually three short novellas in structure, each providing a plot problem, lots of interaction with Denton and Bran, and a sex scene (or two), so it's got some story in there. The smexytimes are fun but understated. It's an amusing book with good characters and a nice paranormal vibe. Had fun with Denton meeting Bran's mother. She's a powerful witch, and has been angling for Bran to meet a partner--so much so she cast some charms on Bran's bed to draw his perfect mate close....that minx!

Some people would celebrate this as ""strong moral character"" but Ellie feels cursed. She's been at uni in London three years now and has never had a boyfriend. She's not hideous, or deformed. Mostly, she's average--with an overdeveloped sense of self-loathing. 
 See, Ellie feels left out of the crowd whenever her buds start talking about hook-ups and beer goggles and embarrassing first times. She wants to have sex, dammit, and it becomes her mission. This, by the way, comes with a whole lot of pre-sex prep--including waxing, shaving, and plucking to cultivating the perfect lady garden. 
 I will, for the record, state this is the only book which made me laugh out loud over the use of the term: Hitler. 
 Ellie's quest leads her to almost hooking up, having a huge fall out with her childhood BFF, fighting with her mom, making a new BF, making a gay best friend (who happens to also be virgin), starting a vlog, meeting a decent guy, having fairly decent snogs, gaining self-confidence, and experiencing epic fails at both scoring and pubic bareness. 
 I did have several moments of /facepalm laughs. Poor Ellie! 
 Spoiler--she does tear her V-card. 
 Not-so-spoiler--She has one heck of a time getting the deed done. 
 So, on a personal level, I totally sympathized with Ellie's eagerness to be ""just like everybody,"" but I was also glad she found new connections. Her mother's ham-handed effort to unite Ellie with Paul was so brilliantly handled. And, Ellie reaching out to Emma helped Ellie to grow out of her cautious shell. I truly adored Ellie's adventurous spirit. She's like that awkward cousin everyone likes but quietly pities because she's so sweet and yet so socially clueless. 
 Ellie's level of personal growth was excellent--she didn't emerge from her shell-she burst forth and dove headlong into an active social experiment: Operation Fix Ellie. But, having finished her quest, with bittersweet results, Ellie took a moment to reflect on her self and realized that she wasn't broken at the beginning of this journey. She was just fine being a virgin--even if she wasn't a virgin any longer. I rather liked her more for that. 
 Now, be prepared for lots of vagina talk in this book. The amount of time devoted to pubic grooming is substantial, and forms many of the gags in this book. Imagine a hairy man being outraged by pubic hair, while a bare man is stunned to not find any? Yeah, poor Ellie just can't win that battle. 
 I also liked VIRGIN's commentary on porn in today's society. The arguments about its prevalence and acceptability were sound and funny, and the expectations placed on women as a result of porn rang true. The setting was cool, because I like the London scene and lingo. The smexytimes were akin to THE FORTY YEAR OLD VIRGIN in scope and humor. Lots of fits and starts with cringe-worthy happenings that only made me love Ellie more for embarking on this personal journey. This book is NOT for young kiddos. Lots and lots of frank discussions of sex, and how to get some...so, parental guidance and all that.

I heartily recommend this book, as my review (which you may or may not choose to read) clearly states. 
 First off, I'm going to say I read this book in nearly one evening. I got sucked into the voice of the book and had to let up in the wee hours before work. Ben is a fun narrator. He's a 40 y/o ""washed up"" wakeboarding pro who now runs a surf shop in his hometown of Lake Lovelace, FLA. I say he's washed up, mostly because that's how Ben talks about himself. He had a serious accident in his last competition busting a bunch of lumbar vertebrae. Frankly, it's a miracle that he's walking, let alone giving private lessons. 
 Still, Ben suffers addiction issues--booze and prescription painkillers. He's been sober the past 8 years, but he hasn't gone back for his last corrective surgery too afraid that the post-op medicine will draw him into a pill-popping abyss. 
 One day a delicious specimen of man arrives in the surf shop--needing lessons. Well, Ben isn't gonna turn down the money. Especially not when he recognizes Davis as being gay, too. See, Davis has been forbidden contact with his teenaged half-brother, Ridley, because his stepfather is homophobic. While Ben attempts to teach Davis the basic skills of wakeboarding the heat builds between them. Out together socially, the connection is stronger than Ben has previously had--he's mostly a hook-up type of guy. 
 This is perfect for Davis, the connection, that is. He's a 'One Man' kinda guy, and their courtship has such a foreign dynamic for Ben--Davis is bossy and tender and flexible--that it completely unsettles him in the best way. For the first time he's in a relationship. At least, until Davis finds out Ben's hiding his back injury. Davis can't really deal with Ben being one bad landing away from paralysis--but this isn't why he pushes Ben away. 
 Fear not, however. Ben learns to face his biggest fears, and in the process reconnects Davis and Ridley in a way that makes estrangement impossible. 
 The writing is fun and the characters are flamboyant. Ben's boss/bedbuddy/childhood BFF, Eddie, is a total hoot. Ben doesn't take himself seriously, but he's serious about Davis. The connection might have been a touch too quick to develop, but it was handled well. Smexytimes were well-written and steamy. In short, a quality summer read.

 This contemporary M/M biker romance was engrossing from the start. 4.5 stars. 
 Zak is a tattoo artist covered in exotic ink and piercings. He's an out gay man, but discreet, especially as he lives in southern Louisiana--not known for having ""open minds."" He moves into the Lake Valley home he inherited from his great aunt and shows up at a nearby biker bar to drop off some promotional material. That's where he meets the rough and tumble Viking-like Stitch. 
 Stitch is newly divorced and unsure of how to go on. He still shares a home with his ex, Crystal, so they can co-parent their 5 y/o Holly. Stitch despises Crystal for cheating, but he despises himself more for not being man enough for her. See, despite Stitch's imposing height and brawn he's gay--and ""so far in the closet he can see Narnia"" according to Zak's friend. 
 Stitch wants Zak, and the feeling is mutual. Of course, a bad boy biker can't admit to his homosexuality--in fact Stitch knows he'd be rejected by his bike club, if not beaten or worse. These dudes are big into stolen goods and moving into drug running--an activity Stitch really wants no part of, except it may afford him some luxuries for Holly, Zak and even Crystal. 
 Stitch and Zak take up a clandestine relationship. Stitch has never been with a man, and the freedom of indulgence is intoxicating. His possessive feelings are misunderstood by Zak--with good reason. Who needs a closet bear banging down your door in the middle of the night? Especially as Stitch is not interested in ""bottoming"" something Zak wants. 
 Zak takes other lovers, one of whom is a cop. The reveals of 'Stitch as a gay man' comes slow. And each time it results in serious repercussions. Blackmailed by a cop, denied visitation with his daughter, and even serious injury from men he had long considered comrades. 
 The stakes for Stitch to live an open life are pretty steep--death--yet continuing with his drug-running, warring, bike club looks like the same result. 
 I liked how the book was fearless in presenting the surreal experience of membership in a biker gang. Expect murder. Expect brutality. Expect homophobia in the extreme. It rather kinda turned my stomach how real it felt. No doubt I hadn't expected a FARGO moment, Bayou-style--and yet, there it was. 
 Stitch was extremely impulsive, unable to control even the smallest of urges once Zak and he finally started hitting it. And, it actually takes about a millisecond for them to start hitting it, so the rest of the book is Stitch attempting (at times rather poorly) to hide his relationship with Zak. the smexytimes come fast and furious, but there's some nice introspection on Stitch's part. It becomes clear that Stitch's only way out is to run, and I'm glad he doesn't have to do so alone.",Fri Jul 25 16:15:37 -0700 2014,Fri Jul 25 16:43:22 -0700 2014,Tue Jul 22 00:00:00 -0700 2014,,6,3

 Saba's family is from Pakistan. She was born and raised here, but her parents are traditional. They are, perhaps, more indulgent than other immigrant families allowing Saba to dress in modest Western clothing and compete on the school tennis team as long as her body is covered. We learn through Saba's journal that her apartment is destroyed one day while she and her family are out at one of her tennis matches. 
 Her father reveals that he fears the fire was set by Saba's 6 y/o brother, who has recently discovered matches. In the meantime, Saba's high school community, most of which are affluent families, pitch in to stage an auction fundraiser headed up by Kendra and Kevin Spoon--two newcomers to the school. In fact, it is Kevin who discovers an undiscovered work of art from an ""outsider"" Chicago artist which he donates to the cause. The appraised value is $500,000, and Saba's family is overwhelmed with the possible windfall. 
 In fact, people start to question if Saba's family should benefit from this tragedy. Especially as the cause of the fire is suspicious. The high school principal, Dr. Stickman, thinks the money should go to the school which is in need of repairs. 
 The whole argument becomes moot, however, when the artwork goes missing two weeks before the auction. Then it's a foot race to find the art. Teachers turn on teachers, accusing one another of theft. Was it Mr. Delacroix, the gay art teacher who needs capital to finance his fiber art projects? Or, Coach P, the retiring basketball/tennis coach who had easy access to the art as it was locked in her office? Students start accosting other students. Saba's distraught that her family's fortunes keep plummeting. Dr. Stickman was my choice for the thief, but, in the end I was completely, artfully, misdirected. 
 All I'm gonna say is: Best. Grift. Ever. 
 I wasn't sure I'd like the story--I usually go for first-person traditional narratives in my YA. This is the exact opposite. There is (virtually) no romance. Surprisingly, the emotions shine through these third-person accounts. Humor is wry and abundant, with irreverent speech from Saba, incongruent speech from a Spanish exchange student (""in the kitchen, not the chicken"" *snorts*) and the contrast between the humble laborer life of Saba's father and the privileged pomposity of Dr. Stickman. 
 The story clips along, with devious reveals and backhanded breadcrumbs. I love being led on a merry chase, and enjoyed each moment of red herrings--once I finally saw them for what they were. Bravo.",Thu Jul 24 18:16:07 -0700 2014,Thu Jul 24 18:17:01 -0700 2014,Thu Jul 24 00:00:00 -0700 2014,,3,0

I endured the twice-yearly school tornado drills, kneeling on the hard floor against an internal wall, balled up tight head down with my hands crossed over my neck, from kindergarten through senior year. I have been there, cooking dinner for my kids watching the winds pick up and the sky darken when those ear-splitting peals have sounded. I have been trapped in the tin can of a moving van driving my earthly possessions cross-country as the anvil cloud formed and the hail pelted down and the rain blew sideways with funnel clouds visible in the NOT NEARLY FAR ENOUGH distance. My son was part of a crew that cleaned up the disaster zone in Washington, Illinois nine months ago when a tornado took out half the town. So, yeah, this book hit me freaking hard. 
 See, like Californians get inured to earthquakes, Midwesterners get too comfortable with storms. What are the chances one is going to hit, right? 
 Jersey is a typical teen in a blended family. She has a step-father, Ronnie, and a five y/o half-sister, Marin. At times, Jersey is moody and jealous and self-centered. But mostly, she's a good student who doesn't get into trouble and has friends she gets along with, even if they have more money and Jersey always feels inferior due to their nicer clothes and slimmer bodies. She's never known her father, her mother ran away when she was pregnant, so she's never met her grandparents, either. 
 Then the tornado comes. Jersey is alone in the house because her mother has taken Marin to dance class and Ronnie has been delayed at work. 
 The house is torn apart. Jersey survives by hiding under a pool table in the basement which now has a skylight where the kitchen used to be. 
 She's terrified, as are the rest of the neighbors, who crawl out of their basements only to find their neighborhood, well, gone. Where the houses stood there is either rubble, or nothing. 
 Cars? Gone. 
 Street? Impassable, littered with debris. 
 Trees? They haven't been splintered to lay across the road or toppled over onto houses, they are simply missing. Gaping wounds in the soil bear witness to the storm's intensity, simply plucking them from the ground like carrots. (I had chills too easily visualizing this level of destruction. I want to say I cried, but I didn't because I was so freaking knotted up my heart was racing and the tears sat poised on my eyelashes.) 
 People encourage Jersey to join them in a nearby shelter--the rain is coming, and they can't tell if another tornado is coming because the sirens have been destroyed--but she opts to wait in the open-air basement, so that she'll be home when her mother returns. 
 Mild spoiler: Jersey's mom and Marin don't make it. I only reveal this because it sets up the rest of the story. See, after two days of searching and waiting, Jersey is discovered by Ronnie, who is so busted with grief he sends Jersey three hours away to live with her father. That was when I started crying. 
 Jersey lives with the guilt of surviving. And, she's doing that on a screen porch in a house full of low-lifes and lunatics with a father who--straight out--tells she she's unwanted and of lesser status than his other kids. It is all Jersey can do to cope, yet she does. She keeps notes on Marin, keeping her spirit alive with tiny cartoons and cherishing Marin's most precious treasures rescued from the wreckage. She laments her previously mean ways, wishing to turn time back and do it all differently. Even to have gone to the dance class if it would mean she had died with her mother and sister and not had to live this horrible half-life. 
 Don't think Jersey is a puddle of woe. She isn't, but she is forgotten and forsaken. Back in her home community, people are rebuilding, and she wants to be a part of that. She wants to feel love--and it isn't happening in her dad's home. Her stepsisters torment her, steal from her, until one day Jersey snaps and an altercation leads to her running away. 
 She doesn't end up on the streets, however. (THANK GOD!!) In fact, the place she's sent is the exact right place she needs to be. Ronnie is moving back east--he can't bear the loss he's suffered, and Jersey is all tied in with that, so he's leaving her behind, too. No, Jersey's new home is the place her mother ran from, the people she's heard horrible stories about her whole life. And it is there that Jersey is able to heal. 
 Jersey's tale really got to me. She is let down and abandoned by just about everyone--her stepfather, her real father, her friends--but she finds sanctuary and she finds hope and she finds that she has people to love her, to share her grief.

 (Well, to me, anyhow...) 
 Now, in light of that auditory experience, we can fully appreciate the kind of emotional tension that exists between Lucy--a rich gal with absent parents--and Owen--a poor boy who just lost his mother and home and has to support his grieving, broken dad. 
 Lucy has had the privilege of a good life, a private school education, and a bunch of nannies. She's 16 and hardly been anywhere her jet set parents have visited. They're in Paris when Manhattan goes dark and Lucy's caught in an elevator with the new super's teenaged son, Owen. Lucy is an optimistic introvert. She longs for life to begin, but isn't sure how it should start. Not trapped in the dark with a boy, most likely.... 
 Owen's 17 and angry. His mother died just over a month ago in a car wreck. His father is a train wreck of grief and unemployment. They moved from a house in Small Town Pennsylvania to a basement apartment to take the building super job. In the posh building, Owen knows he's second class, and he detests how the city sounds overwhelm and the lights consume the starlight. This is a serious problem for Owen--his passion is astronomy. When the power goes down Owen knows two things: he hates New York, and his dad is in big trouble. His "" field trip"" to leave flowers at Coney Island to memorialize their anniversary, has left him miles away from a building in crisis. Still, Owen's distracted from his grief and fear by the girl whose cheerful nature and love of her city is effusive. 
 After they are rescued from the elevator they have no one to report to, and no way of reporting--the whole eastern seaboard has no power--so they hang out together all night on the roof of the building. It's a warm, clear night and the stars are brilliant. Chatting, they give away pieces of theirselves they have never given away before. It's a little bit serendipity, little bit longing, and wholly innocent. Lucy reveals her deep desire to travel, and her inner hurt that her parents never include her. Is she so unimportant? Owen talks about his mother, and his desire to go to college, but his fear of leaving his dad completely alone in the world. Can he? 
 In the days that follow, Lucy's flown to London to join her parents, who are heartsick that she was alone so long in such dire straights. Owen's father loses his job, and their apartment, and he and Owen decide to go the vagabond route exploring America together. 
 Their paths separate, but they connect via postcards, and emails. For a bit. See, Lucy's dad relocates them to Scotland where she's suddenly more than the bookish lonely girl--she makes friends and snags a delectable beau, but somehow he doesn't quite ""get"" her as Owen had. Owen, plagued with a dad who is rootless, settles infrequently and for little time. When they take up in Lake Tahoe he finds a job and meets a girl he likes, but the feelings are superficial and temporary. Meanwhile, he wonders about Lucy and her new life... 
 A christmastime reconnection with Owen and Lucy is a disaster, and the communication ceases. 
 For a bit...I'm not telling mor, but this is a romance, and there is an HEA. So, there. 
 I really enjoyed the lyrical language of this book. The kids are human without being stereotypical. The parents are subject to whimsy, which I hadn't expected, and yet the kids are relatively stable, learning that geography means very little when your heart gets involved. And that's why Christmas was a bust. They had developed feelings in absencia using the other as a barometer for each new connection. 
 Their reticence to commit to those feelings, or even divulge them, (see: Do I wanna Know? Above) is classic teen behavior, even if it's a distance of 7000 miles, instead of a cafeteria, that separates them. I truly enjoyed this introspective, teen read. Again, it's innocent--the barest of kisses occur--and yet, it somehow felt very intimate. Both Lucy and Owen tell the story, and I thought both characters were well-described, likable and interesting. The build of anticipation is palpable even if the characters wander, muddle, and ponder a lot, so I didn't trouble over the pace, which seemed almost ethereal.

 This book sort of meandered for me. Allow me to explain: 
 Sara is given the contents of an abandoned storage unit. It contains art, and furnishings and the erotic diaries of a woman named Rebecca. This Rebecca had been a curator and media specialist for an art gallery in San Francisco. Sara is disturbed by the journals--of Rebecca describing her experiences as a BDSM sub. She is shamefully aroused, and yet also afraid that Rebecca came to an untimely end. 
 Sara hunts out the gallery where Rebecca worked as a way to find out what happened to Rebecca, and also to return the items of the storage unit. Instead, Sara gets hired to replace Rebecca at the gallery, as Rebecca is on ""and open ended vacation with a billionaire boyfriend"". It seems shady, and Sara wants to know the real story, so she goes to work. 
 This is where things got goofy for me. See, August is when teachers and students are returning to school, yet Sara is on ""summer break"" through October. (Weird) This enables her to take the gallery job. I was mystified why an Art Major was a high school English teacher. Then, Mark, the gallery owner is a domineering man and likely suspect for Rebecca's Dom, yet Sara submits to Mark's domineering from the start. There is a pissing match for Sara's interest--between Mark and wealthy famous artist Chris. This starts nearly immediately hinting at a history between the men that gets revealed so much later I nearly forgot it. Mark is trying to control Sara through onerous work responsibilities and Chris is trying to ensure that Sara doesn't fall under Mark's control. For about 60% of the book the plot completely forgets about Rebecca and her ""disappearance"". 
 Sara and Chris strike up a hot, heavy, ""thing""--not sure if it was a relationship or an audition for a bit there--but in the end they decide (after many fits and starts) that they really want to pursue each other exclusively. Oh, and Chris, in the last 10% of the book, reveals his super-shady BDSM club, of which Rebecca had been a member and Mark is the owner. 
 Mark is still left as Shady Suspect Number One regarding the whereabouts of Rebecca, and without learning anything about HER or HER DISAPPEARANCE the book ends on a cliffhanger with Sara completely in the dark. 
 I kinda felt that way too. In the dark, that is. Characters are introduced, have some conversations that I thought would GO SOMEWHERE, and then THEY disappear, too. The resolution wasn't satisfactory to me. The smexytimes were super, but I found myself wondering when we were going to get the BIG REVEAL, and I'm not sure that actually happened. For a full length book, I had expected a bit more loose ends tied. 
 Honestly, if the prose hadn't been as strong, I'd have given it a 3 star rating. I was drawn in, however, even if I left unsatisfied....",Tue Jul 08 09:52:10 -0700 2014,Tue Jul 08 10:13:57 -0700 2014,Tue Jul 01 00:00:00 -0700 2014,,0,0

 TF#1--I have read all Outlander novels (excepting THE SCOTTISH PRISONER) multiple times. 
 TF#2--I have a child with the middle name James, in homage to Jamie Fraser. 
 TF#3--I'm 98% sure reading Gabaldon books increases fertility. 
 TF#4--I threw my copy of ECHO IN THE BONE across the room the first time I finished reading it. 
 TF#5--I totally forgave Diana for making me throw EitB BECAUSE Written in my own Heart's Blood is SO FREAKING AWESOME THAT I MAY HAVE TO STALK Ms. Gabaldon in order to get pieces of the next book ASAP. 
 Here's the thing: Outlander is an epic undertaking. It will break your heart. It will move you to love, to anguish, to violence. Or, maybe that's just me... ;) 
 In this latest installment, Jamie and Claire are reunited--this after Claire had thought Jamie lost in a shipwreck. Oh, and after she had married Lord John Grey--a notable friend of Jamie and a gay man (though his sexual preference is not generally known). Jamie was enraged, understandably, and gravely wounded Lord John in fisticuffs. Reconciliations are reached, but tension remains. 
 Jamie's bastard son William has discovered his tainted lineage. He's wrung out with anger, and embarrassment. How can he accept his role as a British earl, if his father was a Scottish outlaw? Throughout the book he has multiple encounters with both Lord John--his adoptive father--and Jamie. William learns he must accept himself, as himself, and this seems to happen. Hooray! I so want to love William--and I really really do. 
 Roger and Briana and Jem and Mandy all come to good ends--following some extremely harrowing times in 1980 and 1737. Just loved how that storyline got fixed up. And, I'm starting to warm up to William Bucchleigh these days. 
 Ian Murray and Rachel Hunter make the most fun odd couple. How does a Scots-Mohawk convince a Quaker virgin he's The One? I guess with a very big stick... Rachel's fervent logic and patience is the perfect foil for Ian's impetuousness. 
 I was so glad to see the movement of the family through the colonies in the midst of war. The battles weren't epic, but the emotions were tense throughout. I especially loved Jamie's resignation to General Washington. Poignant, for sure. 
 The resolution is exactly what I'd HOPED for--and I'll say that, yes, there is TOO much coincidence in this book, but I DO NOT CARE BECAUSE I WANT MY HAPPY ENDING DAMMIT! 
 Err... 
 I am energized and expectant for the next book--without any of the dread I'd felt over ""MOBY"" as Gabaldon called this work-in-progress. I'm big enough to admit that I can be wounded by my reading. I love some characters too much some times. (This is why I can't read GOT--too many casualties!)",Tue Jul 08 08:52:42 -0700 2014,Tue Jul 08 09:25:19 -0700 2014,Fri Jul 04 00:00:00 -0700 2014,,0,0

 Lara has longed to know her mother for her whole life. She had been killed when Lara was a young girl. Her father did his best, but he was broken by the loss. They get by, and Lara's happy. 
 For her 16th birthday, Lara's dad buys her a ten-trip package into her own past. That's right! REWIND can send people back in time for 15 minute jaunts. Lara jumps at the chance, visiting her past several times. She knows she's not supposed to change anything--in fact trippers CAN'T change anything--until Lara does. She thinks it's an accident, but soon recognizes her ability to alter the past is not a fluke. And now, she's going to save her mom. 
 Success is measured in doses. If one looked at the change in Lara's life after she saves her mom, to how it was before she interfered, one would say it was a toxic dose. Her beloved father is in prison accused of planning her mother's hit, and her mom is remarried to another man, Jax. Oh, and ""new"" Lara has siblings! 
 She also has a new boyfriend--she traded up from ""bad side of the tracks"" Rick to uber-rich Donovan. Life is totally messed up--plus, Lara's mom spends so much time working for REWIND she's never home. Jax is Lara's pro-forma parent, but was he involved in a setup to frame Lara's dad? 
 The more Lara uncovers about her new life the fewer people she can trust--starting with her mom. Seems she's a (diabolical) scientist being (perhaps) manipulated by an old colleague. It's a twisty mess, that even Lara can't unravel by going back. Plus, the memories of her old life are crashing the memories of her new one, causing nosebleeds and crushing headaches as she suffers life-threatening traveling sickness. 
 It's a worst-case Butterfly Effect scenario that Lara struggles to escape, without losing her grip on reality altogether. I enjoyed the ride, watching Lara dip back and forth in her timeline to right wrongs and fix problems. Such a mess sorting through her broken house of cards! Lara is always playing from behind as she gets dropped into her new reality as if she lived it--and learns that she suspected an evil plot even when her life seemed idyllic. The breadcrumbs were scattered far and wide, yet, Lara picks them up and reassembles the original loaf, not without difficulty. 
 Once you give people access to your mind, you find that they can control you quite easily, as Lara soon learns. The end leaves everything managed, albeit not ""back to normal""--mostly because Lara isn't normal, and her new, new life is the best she can manage. Wonder if she ever thought about going back to her old life and tearing up that REWIND gift.... 
 Maybe, just a little.",Mon Jul 07 11:34:37 -0700 2014,Mon Jul 07 11:36:01 -0700 2014,,,1,0

Her dad went on a four-month sabbatical to London and he didn't return. He's alive, and well, and currently completely divorced from Hadley's mother. In fact, he's marrying the woman who stole her father away. And Hadley's a bridesmaid. She's never met his bride, and she hasn't seen her dad in more than a year. In fact, Hadley wouldn't be staring at her plane pushing back from the jetway right now if her mother hadn't pushed her into accepting the wedding invitation. 
 So, Hadley's not keen on love. She thought her parents had it--everyone seemed so happy--but love pretty much sucks if it rips your dad away to a new country and life. At least, it does in Hadley's opinion. She gets rescheduled to the next flight, and encounters Oliver in the terminal. He's a quiet, unassuming young English man--he's nearly 19 and a college student returning home for a family event. They strike up a conversation that spans the flight. It's a purge. All the misery Hadley had bottled up in the past year and half since her dad took his trip to London is spent out. 
 Oliver is an excellent sounding board--and distraction. Especially when he kisses her and the seeds of attraction blossomed into a budding love. 
 Then he's gone--and Hadley's still got to face her father and the wedding she wishes wasn't occurring. It is a twisted experience, to see one's parent so happy--knowing the misery this happiness created for one's self and one's loved ones. Having rid herself of her anger, Hadley is able to experience her father's abounding joy in a way she hadn't predicted. And, she's able to give the one thing she never fathomed: forgiveness. 
 That isn't the end of the story however, and Hadley learns that Oliver had kept a pretty large secret to himself aboard that long flight. Can they find the common ground they had in transit or is the L-word a statistical impossibility? 
 Normally, I no huge fan of instalove, but this book--while the time frame is two days--unfolds so seamlessly it feels genuine. I was wrung out in Hadley's point of view. What an overwhelming experience she's had with the devastation of her parent's marriage. Often kids know there are problems--but in this case, there hadn't been any warning signs. Her parents were happy. Fun. Planned big vacations touring the US. Hadley and her mother were going to visit London at the end of the sabbatical. And then everything changed. 
 Hadley's abandonment is a palpable presence in her life. She develops panic attacks, and spends months caretaking for her shell-shocked mother. She never has a chance to breathe, to grieve the loss of her previous life before it's all gone. Wracked by anger, Hadley plans to cut her dad out of her new life--and had been rather successful at it--until the wedding. Understandably, Hadley wants nothing to do with the woman who caused so much heartache--who, by the by is not a step-monster. Still, after over a year's separation seeing her dad is a knife wound to the chest. She has missed him terribly. and she comes to realize that having a relationship with him means accepting terms she couldn't have previously considered. 
 See, there is no cliche here. There is pain. There is love. There is loss. There is gain. There is human life unfolding in a way that voids all plans and cancels all debts. I seriously ached for Hadley--over and over again. Her mom has moved on--met a man who adores her, yet the child in Hadley holds a serious grudge. I would have, too. Watching her let go of that pain, however, was excruciating. My heart had to stop feeling in order to not be overwhelmed. Oliver was a spectacular love interest. And the promise that these two might find love, together, was the jump start I needed to get past the strong emotions I'd suffered in the course of reading. (Disclaimer: I didn't even hate Hadley's dad when all was said and done--which is saying quite a lot about how well this story was told.)

When he wakes from his coma, memories of the past three years of his life are gone. He thinks he's still in prison, that his father is still alive, that he's a straight man. None of these are true. Or, are they? 
 Leith latches on to his brother, Arthur, adrift in loss. Arthur tries to help, but the advice is to reveal little in terms of the lost years, to wait until Leith recovers the memories--if Leith does. See, they don't want to upset Leith with too many uncertainties--he's a bit unmoored emotionally, and strong. When he first saw Arthur and learned all he had lost, Leith struck out and clocked his brother in the jaw. Control of his life, and his temper, is hard for the new Leith. 
 ""Friends"" visit the hospital to help his transition, but Leith doesn't remember any of them--not even Zach. Zach is introduced as his ""best friend"", but the reader knows more than Leith. He and Zach had been lovers for a year, and totally committed. Zach's heartbroken, and trying to maintain a brave face, but his video blogs show the gaping cracks in the facade. 
 Throughout, Leith agonizes to regain his foothold in his new reality. The only thing he knows for sure is the calmness he feels when Zach visits. He longs for more time with his ""best friend"" and is confused by the sexual arousal he feels in Zach's presence. Zach's nearness yet seeming indifference leads Leith to believe his attraction to Zach was one-sided before the injury, and he's conflicted about revealing his ""new"" feelings. Meanwhile Zach is falling apart thinking Leith will never love him again. It sparks a one-night stand that comes back to haunt Zach. Big time. 
 In some ways, Leith died in the ring. The post-injury Leith is a different man in so many aspects, but it may be that this man is a better man, a more stable partner, than the man Zach first loved. 
 As time moves on, Leith is better able to control his temper--revealing his feelings for Zach helped immensely--but there are still struggles. Leith wants to box again. It was a major way he coped throughout his life, and the absence of that physicality brings its own strain. And Zach is terrified that one bad hit will kill the man he has had to woo, and come to love, twice over. 
 While this book centered on amnesia, there are lots of people who endure other neurological injuries and have personality changes. The hardest thing for their loved ones to reconcile is the change--Zach is a good partner, but a confused man in his own right, understandably so. His love has suddenly and without question forgotten him completely. He could walk away, but he doesn't. His struggle is no less hard than Leith's--overcoming his own memories to make a totally new life with a Leith is a decision. I was glad he made the right one. 
 The book is brutal in its emotional landscape. Highs and lows. Confusion and resolution. Anger and peace. And, love. At the center, love shines. Zach's patient acceptance, bringing all Leith's fave foods to the hospital. Moving out so Leith can have his own space to reconnect. Coming back after Leith clobbers him in a blind rage. All of these are acts of love. Leith working to regain his memories, his sense of self, so he can recover the good times of his life with Zach is an act of love. Even more so, Leith abandoning this effort and committing to simply making new memories is the biggest show of his love. 
 At times I just wanted to reach into my iPad and grab these two into a group hug and whisper that it was all going to work out. To that end, I kinda felt the resolution was a teeny bit rushed. That said, I loved the book. The smexytimes were predictably hot and fantastic, so thanks for that. I had to chuckle when Leith's doctor said it was time to leave the hospital because all the nurses were distracted trying to get a peek of Zach and Leith together....LOL, for real. The book steams, so not safe for the youngin's.

 Nick and Kevin knew each other back in college. They played soccer on the school' steam and were allies and friends, were both ""out"" but never dated. Nick was a virgin, and really wanted Kevin--but he wanted only Kevin. Kevin, unfortunately, racked up the one night stands like it as going out of style. Even when Kevin made a move, Nick backed away. He couldn't give his virginity to a man who didn't love him...and Nick didn't believe Kevin did. 
 Ten years later, Kevin is on business in Asheville NC and pops into the bar Nick own. In fact, Nick owns both a bar and a restaurant. He's successful, not that Kevin cares about that. He's just jazzed to meet up with his old college friend. Both men are single, and Nick is surprised to find he's still just as smitten with Kevin as he was years ago. Maybe more so. 
 Kevin makes sure that Nick takes his number--just to reconnect--and Nick delays in calling, unsure why to bother--Kevin still seems like the party-guy he was in college. They do chat, however, and Nick is soon overwhelmed by his desire for Kevin. Over a period of months they re-establish a rapport, one that becomes increasingly difficult for Nick to resist. When Kevin comes back for another work trip they go out dancing--and Nick lets it all go. Well, maybe not ALL. 
 Still, the attraction simmers between them. Kevin wants the physical, and Nick wants the emotional. Can they find a middle ground? Maybe, especially when Kevin's stranded in Asheville due to snow and stays with Nick for the night. 
 This slow burn has all the elements of a romance in a novella format. I could have read on and on. Truly. Thanks for such a great story.",Mon Jun 23 05:51:21 -0700 2014,Mon Jun 23 06:13:30 -0700 2014,,,1,0

 Xander is a human with a long-time crush/desire for his college buddy-turned-business partner, Malone. Malone is a vampire, and Xander wants to be his in all ways possible, but Malone has continually refused him. He finally goes big--offering himself as a submissive source/partner to any vamp who will claim him in a vamp club. He doesn't know if Malone will come, but he hopes. 
 Malone knows he's a vicious dude. He bears no love for his feeding partners, and is a brutal Dom to them--it's not what he wants for his longtime friend, Xander. No, Malone cherishes Xander--so he must rescue Xander--first from the club, and second from Xander's illusions. He must be so cruel that Xander decides he cannot handle Malone as a Dom. 
 Thing about the best laid plans....yeah. This one goes astray.

Xander is so steadfast and pure in his desire, and Malone is so conflicted in his desire--it's a tense, taut narrative with plenty of hope for a real love for these men. Just adored.

 This book has hijinks. Lots of them. Kayla has long believed her father abandoned her. She hasn't had any contact in five years--since he cut all child support and alimony. She's broke, and indebted to a shady character to the tune of 20G's--a debt incurred by her mother who has recently died. She arrives at her father's funeral, for closure, only to learn that there's an inheritance--and a catch. In order to pursue the undisclosed fortune, she must be (literally) shackled to her father's former garden keeper--richboy/playboy Daren Ackwood. Ugh. 
 Daren can't believe Kayla even dares to show her face in their small town. She's as heartless as her mother, he supposes, cutting all ties with her father and living like a princess on her trust fund. She didn't even have the decency to visit when he was dying. And now she wants a piece of the joint inheritance? Daren doesn't think so. 
 Their constant interactions help reveal the complete misconceptions these two have. Neither of them is rich--and haven't been for some time. As the story is revealed we learn that Kayla's trust fund was squandered by another--she never even knew she HAD a trust fund, and Daren's wealth was consumed by his father's alcoholism and legal troubles. They are, essentially, indigent. Revealing all these frailties brings Daren and Kayla close in a way they hadn't experienced with another. 
 It turns out Kayla's dad has set up a scavenger hunt, something he had done often when she was young. The memories evoked and letters he left behind gut Kayla. She learns so much about him, and his love for her, with no way to make amends for all they lost. Coupled with Daren, Kayla's emotions are on overload and he gains compassion for her. He sees that she was abandoned--not by choice--and really connects with Kayla. Their attraction is mutual, but neither can easily admit the need to be together--they've been abandoned too many time to trust another person. Until, maybe, it's too late. 
 The device of hitching these two played better than I had expected. There's some fun moments when they take tumbles or bang around due to their physical attachment. I would have liked even a bit more of their coping--with, say, toilet time. Nothing more intimate then defecating in front of someone....unfortunately. It wasn't even mentioned. I kinda felt the ""love"" was rushed--even in this extreme case--but I was glad to see the emotional shifts these two made. They are already old beyond their years, due to crap parental influences, so their brief bouts of silliness was refreshing. A quality HEA I could get behind!

 This is the second book in the Valespian Pact series. Books should be read in order. A quick catch up: 
 Zeus is a Fal/Amoric prince. This is news, because he'd grown up believing he was Terran--even though he was raised by the Mar'Sani emperor--who fully adopted him and it is with this race that Zeus associates. He has always felt loved and cherished by his adoptive family, but there are factions of Mar'Sari who despise Terrans--the Galactouc scourge--and by extension hate Zeus. 
 Zeus has bonded with a symbiote Dar Massaga--Dargon and Alpha--both males who had never connected with another Dar Massaga and can't imagine pairing with a Terran--but they mate. It is through this mating that they determined Zeus' Fal'Amoric race, becasue all Fal'Amoric males are hermaphrodites--and Alpha becomes impregnated by capturing Zues' eggs and combining them with his and Dargon's sperm. 
 Also, there is galactic war brewing against the V'Saar, a bug-like species that is brutal and carnivorous, and this war can only be stopped if the Galactic Princes can find their missing third--the Fal'Amoric prince Prometheus. Prometheus has been missing for two decades and, lacking a better candidate, Zeus may be pressed into service-paired the the other Galactic princes--in order to maintain the magical power to keep the V'Saar out of the alliance's galactic space. 
 OKAY! 
 So, Alpha's about to deliver kits--to be raised in Dargon's marsupial pouch for a year. This is a super tricky exchange and requires a stable environment--not easy to achieve while on board a ship carrying the Fal'Amoric royal family exiles back to their home on Valespia. 
 In order to survive, the refugee ship travels with a military convoy of Mar'Sani--containing Zeus' Mar'Sani brothers, one of whom is the heir apparrant of the Mar'Sani emperor. Together they hunt allies--Feteine robots who can help defeat the V'Saar that chase them to Valespia. 
 Zeus and Dargon are injured gravely at the power of the Qrxzl--which not only cements a Feteine partnership, but also reunites Alpha with his first offspring, Star Eater. Together this coalition survives the trip to Valespia, but there they face a battle royale, one that results in extreme danger for both Alpha and the kits. Zeus is an amazing tactician, and an unexpected partner arrives with a host of warriors tipping the balance in Zeus' favor. 
 Political alliances are further challenged, but the truth wins out, yay! The books resolves, with an ongoing plotline to carry forth--still ont he hunt for Prometheus. 
 There is a LOT going on here, and the pace is brisk. I enjoyed this book better than the first one, as we really get a better sense of Zeus and his valor. His family is completely supportive, and Dargon and Alpha are tremendous in their role as partner to Zeus. I am not a fan of Sci-fi, but this book series has held my interest completely. The smexytimes are brief and understated, allowing the emotional context to be the foundation of the romantic landscape.",Sun Jun 15 06:30:44 -0700 2014,Sun Jun 15 08:29:35 -0700 2014,Fri Jun 13 00:00:00 -0700 2014,,7,0

 If you're planning to read this book, you ought to have read the previous five installments first.

 To be clear, I have a total girl crush on Charley. First Grave got me totally hooked on the ADD-suffering, grim reaper. She's hysterical and brave and selfless and damned funny. Her brightly shining aura guides souls into the Great Beyond, each time she senses a little of that soul's experiences--upping her empathy quotient by bazillions. 
 Her love interest, Reyes Farrow? Well, he's the dark side of the coin. And by dark, I mean black. He's the son of Satan. 
 No, no! Not that! Cripes! I'm not a freak! 
 Oh yes, that's much better. 
 Don't let his lineage fool you, however, Reyes is unequivocally, unremorsefully, totally in love with Charley. His mission was to escape Hell and kill the next Reaper. In fact, it is still his mission, he simply found Charley's essence so awesome, he decided to be born on Earth so he could know her. 
 His life on Earth hasn't been even just plain okay--he suffered horrific abuse and was jailed for a time. Still, he served Charley as a defender many times, and has built a fortune which he uses to protect Charley's interests--oh and he wants to marry her. He's waiting (again) on Charley--for her answer. 
 So, in this installment, Reyes is in constant pursuit of Charley's answer, affection and companionship. A living man seeks Charley's help getting his soul back from a demon. One of Charley's ""friends"" has been kidnapped as a bargaining chip to get access to a WITSEC informant. And Charley's cooked up a fool proof plan to get her Uncle Bob to finally ask her BFF Cookie out on a date. Whew! That's a lot for a book that spans only a few days in time.... 
 The Dealer is a new supernatural in town. He's a Deava, the kind of demon Satan would stitch together from the remnants of dying demons. He's on Earth's plane, eating souls for sustenance. Charlie wants to win back the soul of his client, and makes an ally instead. A powerful one as even Reyes will admit. It seems the Dealer would like Satan defeated, and he knows that the Twelve hounds of hell have been unleashed to find Charley. 
 Cookie's dating takes up a good part of the book--Charley sets her up on three fake dates to irritate Ubie enough to get the gumption to (finally) make his move. I love when a harebrained scheme falls apart spectacularly. As this one does. 
 Meanwhile, Charley's reaper powers are becoming stronger. She is able to summon souls at will--and even mark them for Heaven and Hell. This becomes more important when she's being blackmailed and tortured, by the police and a Mexican drug cartel, respectively. 
 Interestingly, Charley is only kidnapped for an hour in this book. To be fair, I t's a shitty hour with lots of innocent blood spilled, but usually she's facing death a whole lot longer. Even with her newly-expanded powers, Charley's not able to bring everyone home safely. Still there's new life on the horizon, and it's clearly going to get even more hectic for our coffee-swilling heroine. 
 As always, the overall series plot revelation is subtle. Charley gains an ally. She makes a new enemy. Her relationship with Reyes takes on a whole new level. Her father has a new mission--one Charley doesn't know yet. We learn about the Twelve, and how Reyes may tip the balance in Charley's favor.

 An infant, Zeus, is found in hypersleep on a derelict vessel in space near the home planet of the Mar'Sani, a reptilian-humanoid species. The Empress, in grief over the loss of her youngest child, immediately adopts Zeus believing his arrival was ordained by Poseidon. Zeus is not only blind, he's a Terran (human) and Terrans are the scourge of the galaxy due to their rapacious enslavement of other planets. A war had been fought and a treaty established, but Zeus is still subject to prejudice, even as a son to the Mar'Sani imperial family. 
 Zeus grows up. He is loved and cherished by his family. An attack prompts his father to employ the galaxy's preeminent geneticists, the Chtichlians, to restore Zeus's eyesight. While sedated Zeus learns that he's not quite Terran--he's a hermaphrodite--a physical condition the Chtichlians soon remedy by removing Zeus' hidden uterus. 
 In time, Zeus grows into a powerful warrior, like his older foster brothers, but Zeus is denied entry into the Mar'Sani warrior training so he goes to university. He becomes the chief starship mechanic on a prime star base. While there he encounters Dargon and Alpha. This symbiotic male is comprised of a Dar Massaga and his paired symbiotic Alpha who resides as a partial covering on his body. They are connected via a mind link and sexually active within their combined unit. Dargon feels no interest for other mates, but meeting Zeus turns on his Marking instinct. This sucks because Dargon holds a deep hatred for Terrans. And that's what he believes Zeus to be. 
 Dargon is in the space port for repairs, all while hiding his live cargo. At first Zeus thinks he's a pirate, but it turns out to be more complicated. Dargon is charged with finding the final Galactic prince, the Bespoken, a Fal'Amoric, or ancient race from whom all species of life were generated. The Fal'Amoric had been herded and hunted by the Terrans in the hope of gaining control of the Galactic counsel. Dargon's cargo is the last Fal'Amoric princess, and Zeus' sister. Oh, and Zeus, too, because Dargon kidnaps him so he can repair the ship while Dargon escapes pursuit from the Terrans and their V'Saar allies. 
 Zeus doesn't want to be Fal'Amoric, he's Mar'Sani by choice, and he certainly doesn't want to be the Bespoken, because then he will have to be united with the two other (hermaphoroditic) Galactic princes--especially not when his baby is being carried by another. Zeus's only chance is to find his lost brother, Prometheus, in order to fulfill that Galactic destiny, and it seems his memories of his sexual mutilation by the Chtichlians holds the key. 
 Holy cow. I was a bit stunned by the pace. So many species, of which I had no grasp, and yet, I adored Zeus. He overcame so much prejudice. And his destiny is truly great. He has a lot of power within himself, and is only just learning to use it. His strength has won him many admirers in the Mar'Sani nobility, even if he's persecuted by some for his 'Terran' appearance. He's also won over Dargon and Alpha--completely. They have imprinted on him, so they need to remain near each other--even if Zeus must couple with the Galactic princes. Does this make Zeus the center of a love square, or a love pentagon? 
 I liked the slower build of ""pairing"" between Zeus and Dargon and Alpha. They recognize their passion, but want to start slow--not that they hold off on all physical contact. I guess they recognize the inherent problems with the possibility that Zeus will be claimed as the Bespoken. It's an interesting book. I had feared I'd get bogged in detailed explanations of sci-fi whozits and whatzits, but that didn't happen. The disjointed timeline was sometimes a gripe, but the pace was adequate. I'm interested enough to seek out the sequel.

 The narrator is a cross-country runner. Her coach has warned the team of eating disordered athletes and insists that all runners complete a food diary to ensure that they are eating sufficient calories to maintain their physical fitness. The narrator--I'll call her ""Ana"" though she remains unnamed throughout--does this. She's committed to her team and her success as a runner. Her BFF, Jill, is a ballerina. She helps Ana to find online/mobile app resources to track her food intake better. All is going well, though it is clear that Jill is showing signs of anorexia--she's desperate to lose weight so she can get the lead in The Nutcracker. 
 Meanwhile, Ana's father is a horse's pah-toot. He lavishes attention on Ana, and ignores or fat shames his wife. Shortly into the journal we learn that he's been having an affair and he leaves. Ana'a distraught at the collapse of her family--and has trouble eating, but the running helps stabilize her mood. She inadvertantly loses a few pounds--no worries. In fact, that's great as far as she's concerned because her mom is a fat mess and NO WONDER her dad left. The disordered thinking begins. 
 Ana goes on a trip with Jill and her family--with Jill older brother Jack showing all sorts of interest. Is it because she's lost weight? Jill's mom thinks so. Her subtle comments and flawless appearance reinforce Ana's thoughts that being thin is better. Meanwhile, Jill convinces Ana to drop her caloric intake in solidarity--so they can both lose weight together. Dropping more weight allows Ana to run faster times than ever. She's promoted to captain of the cross-country team. Other friends become alarmed. Vanessa must just be jealous, right? 
 Jill gets her dream role in the ballet. Her dad is pushing his new, slender, beautiful girlfriend in Ana's face. Her mother balloons, drowning her depression in ice cream and bacon. There is only one thing Ana can control--herself. 
 Ana and Jack are a tight item, but will he still love her if she gains weight? He asks her to Homecoming and his mom takes her dress shopping with Jill. The most Beautiful Dress Ever is purchased, even if it's too tight. She only has to lose 8 more pounds to fit. Jack won't look away like her dad did if Ana is the most beautiful girl at Homecoming. Only 8 pounds. 
 Yes. It progresses. It gets worse. Ana is a shell of the girl who began the journal. It is a harrowing, realistic protrayal of a person being so trapped in negative psychology she can't eat anything without self-hatred and guilt. There is a good dose of the online community that celebrates ""Thinspiration"" and anorexia. There are real efforts to bring Ana back from the edge before she tumbles over. Medical bills and insurance battles ensue, but the time runs faster than Ana. Damage is done, and all that is left are broken hearts. 
 The journal-style is taut. It is clean and free of fluff. Ana is disturbed. She is lying to everyone, including herself, but she can't see anything clearly as a result of the disease. Having seen disorders like this in my own life--it felt painfully true. And frightening. Because--out there somewhere--TODAY another ""Ana"" is falling over the edge. And that's the scariest part. How real this all is.

 Kane is a strong lead. He's a gay wolf shifter who has stuck out on his won after being run out of his pack by his father, the Alpha, for being gay. Being an Alpha wolf is something one is ""born to"" and Kane becomes the Alpha of a pack of five gay shifters--one being his long-time friend Griff. They all work together in an auto/motorcycle restoration business small western town, called Cloverleah. 
 One day Kane pops into the local diner and is overwhelmed with the scent of another wolf. One that sends his libido racing. Kane had long been told that gay wolves had not ""true mates"" but his body disagrees. Meeting Shawn, Kane senses something different--beside the fact that Shawn clearly wants to bolt. 
 Unwilling to let Shawn run in fear, Kane gets his packmates to visit Shawn at work, to let him know they are harmless to him. They may be, but Shawn's father isn't. He's sent hunters after Shawn for the past decade. See, Shawn's a wolf--but he's also MORE. A Shifter Guardian who holds a crapload of magical powers. The hunters shoot Shawn and Kane's the one who can reach into the magical haze and pull out the spelled slugs. 
 The two men claim each other as mates leading to a ""war"" between packs. We get interference from Kane's home pack--and resolution of old grudges and alliances newly forged. 
 What I liked: 
 Kane and Shawn are both strong leads. They are interesting and compassionate. Supporting characters play important roles and have their own mini-arcs in the story. The story is interesting, if a bit verbose. 
 What I didn't like: 
 The instalove was too INSTA. We barely met Kane and he was obsessed with an unknown party. 
 The complete lack of ""American"" diction in this ""American"" tale. Lookit, I'M AMERICAN. AND YET I LOVE BRITISH BOOKS. Do not write in British slang and slap in a couple of city names like Denver and San Antonio and expect this to be translatable. IT IS NOT. The characters sound like ""blokes"" I'd find in Liver-freaking-pool, not the American West. There is a cadence and syntax specific to idiom and colloquial speech. Men in America do not sound like the men in this book--not even the gay men. Sorry. 
 The book needs a complete line edit. There are multiple mistakes per page with regard to spelling, word choice, grammar and punctuation. It is a travesty and demonstrates to me, an avid and voracious reader, that the author has little respect for my comfort or enjoyment. Because, frankly, it is painful to have to continually mentally exchange the proper word, or intimate the intended meaning from a poorly punctuated statement. It tells me the writer is a poor editor and needs to shell out some cash to someone competent in this enterprise. Also, if the book is to be set in America, I would suggest finding a US editor--one who could assist in removing any and all Briti-cisms from the text.",Wed Jun 04 05:09:55 -0700 2014,Wed Jun 04 05:39:57 -0700 2014,Tue Jun 03 00:00:00 -0700 2014,,5,0

 Hanna has stumbled through her Swiss-cheese memory for the past five weeks hoping to gain back her knowledge from the past year--all lost in a traumatic brain injury. She awoke from a coma with an engagement ring and amnesia. 
 She has just come to terms with deciding not to marry Max, her lifelong crush, because she doesn't trust his motives. See, if she marries him, she gets access to her trust fund--and Max has a struggling business. Is that why he proposed? Because Hanna now knows that Max hadn't initially wanted to date her--he was pushed into it by her twin sister--and Max had (has?) a mean girl in waiting, Meredith, whose child's paternity is in question. 
 Meanwhile, Hanna has a big problem that she needs to deal with, and it involves Nate, her rocker-bad boy-secret-boyfriend. Will Hanna confess her secret? She knows it won't change Nate's mind about going their separate ways--he won't let himself get attached to another woman. Then, Nate's tour gets derailed, big time. He's MIA in Afghanistan after his mission to entertain the troops crashes and burns. 
 Max is right at Hanna's side throughout. As betrayed as Max is by Hanna leaving him, he wants to be a part of her life--a big part. I really loved Max for this. Not that I hated him, ever. Nate is great, but self-centered. He's too worried that he'll get hurt again to open himself up to the possibility of real love. Hanna's actually willing to let him off the hook--even as it breaks her heart. Because Hanna's like that: self-sacrificing. It's what turned Max on in the first place--getting to know a woman who only wanted to help others feel better, and not herself. His love for her is true, if only she would let herself believe it. 
 But that's the thing about insecure women. Hanna had a lifetime of being told she wasn't ""good enough"" by her mother who couldn't see past the numbers on a scale. It's a bone-deep sense of unworthiness, and it may just have cost Hanna all the dreams she ever had. 
 Loved the tension. Loved watching Hanna scroll back in her brain to recover the memories of her courtships with both a Max and Nate. Super smexytimes, with a good bit of heartbreak and characters that lived in the pages. Highly recommend.

 Hanna is a fat girl. No shame, really, she's heavy and she hates it. All her sisters are thin and beautiful and have men eating out of their hands. Hanna hates herself, so I'm not shaming her. Besides, her mom's always shaming her. 
 She likes Max, a svelte body builder who owns a gym in her small town. Having drinks, she wishes she had the body to catch Max's eye. Next thing we know, Hanna's slender and in the hospital. Eleven months have passed and Hanna's engaged to Max. She has amnesia--and has no idea what has happened in the past year. Not even the successful bakery she now owns--financed by a secret partner. 
 Trying to regain her memories, Hanna learns that things haven't been right between her and Max. Oh, and a strange man just pops into her bed in the middle of the night. Nate Crane, rocker and notorious bad boy, clearly knows a lot about Hanna. None of Hanna's sisters can fill in the gaps--it seems there was rift between Hanna and even her twin--so she kept everyone in the dark. Meanwhile Hanna had turned anorexic, in o 
 Ryder to drop the pounds. 
 Between Max and Nate, Hanna can't figure out what's going on. Max wants to keep moving forward--and Hanna's mother is full steam ahead planning a wedding in six weeks. Hanna panics, still unable to remember how she and Max came together. She and Nate have an unknown history, but an undeniable attraction. 
 Piece by piece, Hanna learns that she and Max had long been on the outs--but she and Nate have no future, only fun. Nate has a failed marriage on the books, and doesn't want to start a new one. Ever. 
 Of course, the cliffhanger ending is gonna put all this into a whirlwind. 
 It's a fun, twisty ride unraveling Hanna's lost memories. She gets flashes that she pursues, only to get more questions.

Ridley and Link head north to NYC so Link can find himself a band and get busy getting famous. Ridley, well, she's in a bit of hot water with a wager-gone-wrong. She has to provide a drummer for a Caster band in New York, or face the wrath of nightclub owner and Dark Caster Lennox Gates. 
 They arrive in NYC and meet up with the remnants of Devil's Hangmen, Sampson, Necro and Floyd. And, to Ridley's great chagrin, Link fits into the band too well. Floyd, who happens to be an adorable Illusionist, is not shy about sharing her attraction to Link...expect the usual salty exchanges and claw sharpening. 
 Bringing Link, a partial Incubus, to Lennox's Dark Caster club gets Ridley all tweaked out. She knows the danger he faces among full-blodded supernaturals and fears for his safety. It also doesn't help that Lennox is happy to insinuate himself between herself and her Shrinky Dink. (Yeah, these kids have a lotta 'pet names' for each other. I ain't going into Link's food-based song lyrics, but they help ground the story firmly in the YA category...) 
 Seems Lennox has a problem, a powerful adversary that is demanding to be avenged, and Lennox must collect the two people who ticked off his tormenter: Ridley and Link. He will, of course, except that he knows Ridley's fate. Part of his gift is Sight, and he has seen how Sirens are treated in Caster society. His mother was one, after all. Meanwhile, Lennox is drawn to Ridley--and hopes he can save her from his tormentor's captivity if only she'd drop Link. After all, that dude is a Dead Man Walking in the Caster realm. 
 The story is fast-paced with the usual juvenile misunderstandings and new adult wanderings for a life long-dreamed-for, but little-planned. I must say, I enjoyed Ridley. She is completely self-aware of her shallowness, insofar as she finds herself totally unlovable and isolates herself to protect her heart. She loves Link, but she can't bring herself to acknowledge this and risk further vulnerability. Link, on the other hand, is ecstatic over his new band--and their success--he's sure Ridley is just being mean when she tells him his adoring audience was being Charmed. Still, he loves her. He just can't deal with her fears--she's sure they are in great danger--and her manipulations--she totally lied about how he got hooked up with the band. Lennox is wealthy and sophisticated and everything Link is not, but will he win Ridley away in time to save her? Also, Link's execution is all but planned--and from the last Caster either Ridley or Link could have suspected. In fact, Lennox risks his own life in order to tip them off. 
 While the book has a resolution, the story is clearly unfinished. Without question Lennox will be made to pay for his (well-meant) treachery and Link and Ridley can't seem to get far enough out of the line of fire to prevent attack. I enjoyed the ride, and am sure that fans of earlier books will laud the ""Link and Ridley"" story for which they clamored. Considering all the romantic tension and simmering desire, the book is wholly innocent with only a few kisses to propel the love stories...so it's safe for all YA readers.

 I would recommend this to any fan of erotica. 
 Madison has two lovers. Stewart is wealthy and wants her as a beck-and-call girl. Paul is her live-in boyfriend. They each know there is another man. They each know that Madison loves them both. They each love her. 
 It never becomes a menage. This is good, because Paul and Stewart have a lot of history. I'm not saying more. You need to read the book if you want the juicy details. And, there are plenty of juicy details to be had. 
 A lot of reviews complain about the epilogue. Meh. There is room in the heart to love more than one person. If you think a character needs to be oblivious in order to be likeable, well, I'm gonna disagree. I think it would be naive to assume Madison couldn't figure out the connection between Paul and Stewart in two years of dating both of them. And Madison is not naive. Nor is she stupid. 
 In fact, Madison admits that we, the reader, will likely hate her. She's probably right. Too damn lucky, that girl!",Wed May 21 05:57:49 -0700 2014,Wed May 21 06:01:14 -0700 2014,,,0,0

 Sara is a ""disabled"" girl--she always keeps her legs bundled up so no one can see her deformity--a mermaid's tail. She has persevered in life despite her over-protective (and possibly deranged) mother, but she has no idea what is in store. See, under the sea there is a battle a-comin'. 
 Xanthus is a Dagonian--a virtually immortal race born from the union between the gods Dagon and Calypso--so just because he has a tail don't be calling HIM a merman. The Mer, children of Triton, are extinct--or are they? Triton grants Xanthus the power to walk on land in order to hunt down the human polluters who recently contaminated the seas killing thousands of Dagonians. He has one year to find the guilty parties and send them to Triton--and he's efficient. Catches the corporate masterminds who approved the polluting within a month. 
 What he didn't expect to find? A half-ling--a person born of a human and Dagonian. Mixing of the races is unlawful and Xanthus is duty bound to kill this offspring--and the Dagonian and Human who spawned such a monstrosity. Of course, meeting Sara Xanthus' zeal is tamed. The delicate creature is not what he had expected to find. 
 No, he's charmed by Sara, experiencing his first bloom of attraction for a female, ever, even if he isn't quite sure what sort of creature she is--her blue eyes mark her as not-Dagonian. Could it be that she's Mer? If he kills Triton's daughter he's in big trouble, but his authoritarian Dagonians will kill Sara on sight. Dagonians have long hated the Mer. Now Xanthus needs to protect Sara from his own family--and himself--goodness me, the gal's in ""mating season"" and her pheromones are testing every last piece of Xanthus' resistence. 
 The story's clean--suitable for YA readers. It's a fun, fishy tale with plenty of precautionary info--like make sure you pay attention to what sort of drink your date brings you 'cause it may be drugged--and there's a good bit of sexual tension that is dealt with frankly. 
 I had some lingering questions--like where does Xanthus get his money from? And, why is his brother so bent on ruling with an iron trident? 
 I loved how Sara kept herself strong in the face of mythic challenges. Also, there's some cool feminist themes--Sara isn't willing to simply submit to Xanthus, unlike Dagonian women, which is a cool swap. Xanthus has to learn to be less draconian and more open to ""asking"" Sara to do what he'd like. A bit of instalove between the characters, fueled by Xanthus' visceral reaction to Sara's pheromones...which was a neat way to foster sexual tension.",Wed May 21 05:56:11 -0700 2014,Fri Nov 21 00:28:47 -0800 2014,,,13,0

 This historical M/M pirate fantasy was a captivating read. 
 Jon is an empathic young man. frail, and essentially alone--his stepfather acts as a guardian even though Jon is 22 because of Jon's infirmity. Jon is essentially shanghai-ed into piracy while on an errand to find the killer of a prostitute. 
 Ship's captain, Baltsaros, had heard of Jon's skill in divining truth as an Interrogator, and felt his skills would be useful in his shady dealings. Of course, Baltsaros isn't only interested in Jon's mind. No, Jon's lithe frame is very attractive, too. Trouble is, Jon's ill--and Baltsaros will aid his recovery, if only Jon joins the crew. Baltsaros' consort, Tom, is a problem. This former slave has been Baltsoros' bunkmate for years--and he's not interested in being replaced by a whelp with no sea legs. 
 Therein creates the dilemma--Baltsaros wants Jon, Tom wants Baltsaros, and Jon's a virgin--had pretty much been asexual before his kidnapping. Still, he's developing an interest--and Tom's anxious to turn the tide in his own favor. 
 There is a lot of back and forth, with another kidnapping, a man lost at sea, and heartbreak tempered by true affection--time and again. See, Baltsaros is a bit of liar. And, while he may love Jon (perhaps) he's got a whole lot hidden that Jon can't divine. Jon and Tom develop an almost psychic link, and it is clear that there is so much more going on with these three men then lust and lies. 
 I thoroughly enjoyed the times at sea--felt they were well-written. The sex scenes were HOO BOY hot, and involved a bit of bondage and (at times) multiple partners. I liked the alternating point-of-view--but I'm a teeny bit confused at the lion theme--Jon sees this lion over and over in his dreams--and I suspect this will be fleshed out in the second book as a possible magical element.

 Three (somewhat) misfit teens enter the Portland Search and Rescue for very different reasons. Alexis needs something stellar for her college applications so she can hope for a scholarship. Nick wants to be a hero, just like his dad who died in Iraq. And Ruby? She's a CSI wanna-be who has a detective's insight. 
 All of them have issues which is fun for me because their backstories are super interesting. The viewpoint alternates between the three main characters, at first, but we also get some short stretches in the mind of the killer and his victims. 
 Here's what happens--Alexis, Nick and Ruby are called out to search for an autistic man lost in a wooded area around Portland. Along their search they encounter a few men--none who can aid them. Nick is frustrated that they, being so new, are sent to search an area less likely to hold the missing man. We can really see his desire for the accolades of heroism--notably respect and attention from girls--but he's so eager he misses what the careful Alexis discovers: a body. 
 Now, Ruby, Alexis and Nick are the first on the crime scene. Ruby's memory and attention to the details of the scene are valuable, but we can already see she will become a nuisance to the detective on the case. Nick demonstrates a lot of bravado, always covering up his fears with a shrug and bluster. Alexis, well, she's shaken. She accepts some counseling from a teen intervention partner, Bran, who becomes a confidant later. 
 Search and Rescue is called out the next day to scour the crime scene for clues--and Ruby's conservative parents forbid her from going. Not that a F5 tornado could prevent Ruby from stepping into the investigator role. She goes, and is photographed for the paper. This is bad for two reasons: now her parents will see she disobeyed them, and secondly, the killer gets her name. See, he rather likes girls, and Ruby just lights up all his senses. 
 Over the course of a week, we learn that the dead girl was somewhat homeless, and there was another female victim of strangulation found in a nearby park not long ago. She was homeless, too. Ruby is fixated on the case and notices a third strangled homeless girl pop up in the news. This sets Alexis on edge because her mom suffers bipolar disorder and is off her meds. When she flees in a bout of paranoia, Alexis is sure she's living on the streets--at risk from what Ruby suspects is a serial killer. 
 The police aren't convinced there's a serial killer at work; the strangled girls were all from different races and homeless murder victims aren't uncommon in Portland. The trio bands together, even when Ruby's parents remove her from Search and Rescue for disobeying them. And, as we watch through the killer's eyes, this is not the worst calamity to befall Ruby. 
 I won't say any more about the plot except this: the tension was fantastic! We don't know if the killer will find Alexis' mom, or Ruby. We know he's tracking many victims and it's so hard to wait and see who'll fall next. Also, there are three plausible suspects and, even with the bird's eye view, we can't tell who the killer is until pretty late in the book. 
 Alexis, Ruby and Nick are interesting, well-developed characters. They have real families with specific and relatable teenager problems. And, they work to solve their own problems. They are ""normal"" kids, ones you could encounter in any metro area in the US--not uber wealthy, or spoiled rotten, or super hackers, or broken. They just struggle along the way we all do, working within the system to achieve their goals, and that was refreshing. I really loved how Alexis reached out to Bran for some comfort when her mom went missing--but man was I scared when she went out on the hunt! Ruby's obsession with true crime and detective stories was really cool. And, poor Nick, that kid needs a hug. Maybe lots. 
 The book is thoroughly innocent of romance, but has scenes of violence associated with murder. The prose is specific and clean, and the story snaps along at a brisk pace with no info dumps clogging up the case, and well-handled misdirections. It's easy to see how these misfits grow into a unit, one that will spark friendships and comaraderie into future stories. Definitely would recommend for teens (and above) who enjoy murder mysteries and buddy tales.

 Wabac machine photo of Neil Patrick Harris as Dr. Dougie Howser nipped from http://www.fanpop.com 
 Back in the day there was this TV show I loved about a child doctor. While my kids will forever know Neil Patrick Harris as the snarky, sex-hound Barney Stinson, I lost my teenaged heart to a soulful Dougie Howser, MD. Which is why I wanted to read this book. 
 Isabel Jenkins has always been brilliant. And difficult. Her adoptive parents have loved her the best they could, but raising a freaking mega-genius hasn't been easy. She read novels at age 4. She spent one week in Kindergarten and was then homeschooled--couldn't cope with the kids, apparently. She ""entered"" college at 12, and finished med school when she was 17. And, at nearly nineteen she's poised to enter a surgical residency at Johns Hopkins. 
 Then she's given a re-boot. The psych exam she was required to take wasn't too favorable. Seems Isabel is unable to 'connect with others' due to a 'lack of life experience'. This blacklists her from residency programs across the country. She can sit for the psych exam again in 6 months, and has no desire to do research, so she embarks on a 'personal journey': college--for real this time. No private tutors, no learning in isolation. She has a dorm room and a cheerleader roommate named Kelsey. And a delectable RA, Marshall, who, as it turns out, had Isabel's mother as a biology teacher in high school. Marshall's the only one who knows Isabel's a doctor--and she'd like to keep that info on the down low. Blend with the natives, and all that. 
 Unfortunately, Izzy, as she calls herself on campus, is NOT managing. She tries--really--but she almost can't help being the socially awkward kid she is. Having always been the ""prodigy"" all her eccentricities were absorbed by the adults around her and she has no boundaries--because none were ever set. It's no surprise that she blurts out random medical facts when in conversation, and oversteps continually, in the most exasperating ways. Like she NEEDED to swab the flaccid member of Kelsey's overnight guest because she thought she saw a sore? *shakes head* #EpicFail #NotNormalIzzy 
 Marshall does heroic work to save Izzy from becoming a social pariah, and, in the process they become study-buddies; she helps him pass Anatomy, and he helps her learn to be a regular person, perhaps even develop friendships. 
 As Izzy's RA, Marshall isn't supposed to develop a crush on Izzy--but don't let a few rules get in the way there, Marsh! Actually, there's a lot of sexual tension with a slow build toward consummation. In fact, it is Izzy in her medical element that wears down the last grooves in their mutual resistance. Turns out Marsh is sick--and Izzy's the one to find and help him in his days of need. 
 Just as Izzy gains the sense of empathy she had been missing, she recognizes the problems she had caused by her proficient, yet callous, bedside manner. Overwhelmed with feelings she had never really experienced: love, regret, shame, guilt. She steps away from Marsh--running back to the sterility of medicine and the comfort of knowledge. 
 Only, this time medicine isn't the home she used to know, and reconciling with Marsh may become the most important choice she makes. 
 As a book, it was a well-paced, interesting story. Izzy has clear emotional issues, she's antisocial to an almost pathological degree. Her brilliance may grant her access to the medicine party, but what's the point if you never get a chance to dance, right? I really enjoyed the slow build between Izzy and Marsh, how his chronic disease was handled and the baby steps Izzy took toward building lasting friendships. Her growth emotionally was refreshing--seeing her admit that her knowledge wasn't helpful in actually connecting with the people around her was such an 
 Aha! 
 experience. 
 Couple things that troubled me: the whole way the surgical intern/residency issue was described was factually...off. Medical residents in the US don't apply for one then the other, not anymore. Not for, like, 25 years now. Those sort of arrangements are made when a student is graduating med school, so I had to take it as a ""special case for Isabel"" sort of caveat. And, this psych eval, while critical to the story, is also an Izzy-ism. There aren't many prodigies who enter medicine in the US, but they are almost all shunted into research programs to allow them maturity time. This is for everyone's benefit. Close people to me have entered residencies at age 26--rather standard--and they were not taken seriously by their patients--due to their youthful appearance. As much as I admired Dougie, I really wouldn't have wanted a pimply-faced teen (no matter how brilliant, talented or self-righteous *V gives Lorde the stink eye*) lecturing me about my life and/or my passionate love affair with peanut buster parfaits. And neither do most adult patients. Further, I'll take Izzy's negative view of research as another instance of her naivete, because ain't one physician alive who doesn't value scientific medical research. I know, 'cause I been doing it for twenty years now. 
 Still, for fiction this felt good to read. We can always use another representation of responsible teens doing responsible things in fiction. The New Adult tag aside, smexytimes here are tame enough that upper YA readers won't giggle too much. Izzy is to be lauded for her courage, in determining who she is, and who she wishes to be--and then making a responsible plan to achieve her goals. That is NOT to say she makes good choices throughout--'cause she doesn't--but she does enough of the right things at the right times to make me like her.

 Stella Jo used to compete as a show jumper. Growing up on her family ranch, her mother pushed Stella to be perfect--and Stella pushed herself, too, hoping to gain some acknowledgment from her father, a taciturn man. In fact, the only love Stella felt growing up was the love she experienced with her horse. Then, Stella fell while competing and broke her leg badly. Her beloved horse was too injured, and put down. Stella's heart was broken, and she hadn't returned to her family's ranch since--she spent four years at college and just landed a job at a drug rehab facility in Dallas, a few hours from home. 
 On her first day there she meets ""Mr. Walker"" a celebrity client of the facility--one all the female staff are swooning for. Stella swoons, too, she's just not capable of processing her attraction--too many years of shutting down her emotions. 
 Lead singer Van Ransom is plagued by the demons of his childhood: his drug addict mother and too-young death of his older sister, Valerie. He's been in and out of rehab before, with no effect. But this time his record contract is on the line: he must shape up, or the band goes on. Without him. 
 He's prepared to say all the right things to get through, but meeting the aloof Stella Jo turns his head. Van's used to the attention of women--and some of the nurses at Second Chance Ranch aren't averse to a little ""private therapy""--but the enigmatic care coordinator seems impervious to Van's charms. Or, is she.... 
 This ""rock romance"" is unique in that, there is no rock--and the romance is rocky. I really enjoyed seeing Stella come to life. It seemed she was completely emotionally shut down--too busy looking for the next curve in her path to see the lush scenery in her view. She's scarred from too little love, and isn't sure she can even accept love from anyone. Yet, being around Van startles her into sensing her own passion. 
 Unfortunately she can't act on it. Being intimate with a patient is grounds for immediate termination--which would send Stella back to her family home. And that's a place she won't even visit, let alone move back to live. 
 Van is, however, relentless in his pursuit. He volunteers to work in the horse stables so he can spend time with Stella--who continually brushes him off. His mind is driven to distraction, so much so, he actually connects with his therapist and begins confessing his long-secret horrors of growing up in an addict's care, or lack thereof. While none of Van's friends or band mates believe Van will get clean and sober, Van goes the extra distance to entice Stella. 
 For this broken rocker and emotionally-vacant woman, a superficial connection is all one would expect, but the attraction develops into a mutual compassion, a desire to fill the others' needs. For the first time Van can remember, he acts unselfishly--both emotionally and as a lover. He doesn't want a quick hit from Stella--he wants...more. 
 Add the complications of surveillance by Stella's superiors and co-workers, a stalker ex-fiance, and Van's buddies popping in with drugs (just in case) and it seems both Stella's job and Van's contract are set to implode. Good thing Stella's well-practiced at hiding her emotions and Van's self-control can tolerate this rarely-exercised application. 
 Here's what I loved about the book: it wasn't glossy. Stella and Van don't fall into bed the first day, or the first week. They stumble. They overreact. They blame and judge and make decisions 'for the good' of someone else. 
 Truly, I had a little trouble with the depth of their attraction following one chance encounter, but the romance was slow to develop, and the sexual tension was excruciating. Just when it looked like they were going to get it on, somebody would interrupt and complicate everything. 
 The writing is solid, and the romance steams. The progression of their relationship is well-paced and the smexytimes are stimulating, not sloppy. Van has a very filthy mouth, which makes for some fun dialogue. I really liked how Stella reconciled with her parents. Her newfound strength--acquired from beating off Van's advances--was interesting. At times I thought the superficiality of Stella's earlier relationships felt a bit exaggerated, but it was clear that she was making choices to connect with Van and new friends, Miranda and Jesse, in a way she never attempted before. The 'horse therapy' was a nice twist on the usual rehab tale.",Mon May 12 08:51:01 -0700 2014,Mon May 12 08:52:49 -0700 2014,,,2,0

 Alex Marcineau is a problem child--at least that's what her parents' blog Wholesome Home would have everyone believe. From her earliest steps, Alex has faced the scrutiny of not just her parents, but all adults, even teachers who hoped to gain some slight fame by reporting each and every misstep Alex made. Entire books have been written by her parents on how to cope with 'difficult' kids. So, yeah, she's not really interested in maintaining a 'wholesome' image. Especially not when her parents are being considered for a TV show based on their blog. Just more of the same torture--on TV, for a change. 
 Alex is determined to cut loose at camp, but her ex-boyfriend Vijay is being an uber-jerk. He sends her lewd texts which incense her overprotective dad--bring on the private school plans! In an effort to start her camp off right--by antagonizing Vijay--Alex walks up to a new camper and lays a juicy kiss right on him. Only, Javier isn't a camper. He's staff, hired as kitchen help to avoid going to a group home for difficult foster kids. And, he's now in trouble for having 'relations' with a camper. 
 Oy vay! Alex, you really know how to pick 'em! 
 Javier is furious that his big chance to work is nearly snatched away before he even started. He promises to avoid Alex and her drama, but her punishment is to help on kitchen duty, putting these misfits together three times a day for seven days. Though Javier ignores the rants of the tiny hellion, he doesn't stop listening to her. And, he grudgingly accepts her apologies. 
 Add to this mix the larger scheme of kids away at camp and jealousies raging. Vijay ends up in trouble--of his own making, but it embroils Alex and Javier, too. Alex, for her part, wants to win Javier over. She's totally smitten with Javier and wishes he wasn't at such risk to leave camp--plus, she really wants to help him and his mom when she gets paroled at the end of the summer. She even speaks to her mom about it--as Mrs. Marcineau has a few charities she supports that aid single mothers, and find jobs for ex-cons. 
 In addition, Alex has been bitten by the acting bug and is an extra in a few scenes for a movie being filmed not far from camp. Her exuberance and performing ability are noticed by the assistant director who recommends a performing arts school--as opposed to the boarding school Alex's parents have all picked out. While trying to figure out how to re-wire their futures, Alex and Javier can't help falling a bit deeper for each other. What would be an ordinary teen moment gets captured on film and uploaded to the Wholesome Home blog, however, putting Javier's time at camp in serious jeopardy. 
 This book is really a good, fun, innocent read. The pace is perfect, with alternating POV of Alex and Javier telling the story. Their brief romance is natural and energizing--they both know they should stay away, but the attraction is fierce. Not an insta-love connection, they learn about each other and really connect on a deeper level--both Alex and Javier have felt unworthy of love a long time, for different reasons. I really appreciated the way Alex's mother was written--she's a confident woman willing to own up to her parenting mistakes and make amends. It's a good example for Alex, who has many amends of her own to attend. I loved the end. Really. It's how I hoped it would all turn out and I was NOT disappointed in the least. I liked this one better than CAMP BOYFRIEND, mainly because the story was so centered and there were far less clique-politics, for reasons that were explained in the first book.",Wed Apr 30 10:03:31 -0700 2014,Wed Apr 30 10:04:42 -0700 2014,,,1,0

 I didn't expect the Disney version--but what I read wasn't what I expected either. 
 Wendy Darling is a straight-laced, straight-A gal who has just graduated high school. Her family is wealthy and she's due to enter Stanford in the fall. The only problem in Wendy's fairytale life is the absence of her younger brothers, Michael and John. The boys were twins, and surfing addicts who often took off for a day or two at a time to chase the gnarly waves. 
 Well, nine months ago they disappeared without a trace. Then, in January remnants of their surfboards were discovered washed up at a dangerous surf beach called Witch Tree. Her parents have been in a fog since, barely eating, working or interacting since their devastating loss. 
 While out at graduation beach bonfire, Wendy sees a lone surfer in the water and wades out to find him--nearly drowning herself. The unknown surfer brings her to shore, and Wendy makes an instant connection. In the days following she drives along the coast to track down her rescuer. 
 Turns out Pete isn't too hard to find. And Wendy just knows he knows something about John and Michael, despite his protests. Soon she joins Pete's group of homeless surf dudes. Belle isn't too happy with this arrangement as it seems Pete's romantically interested in Wendy. They co-habitate for a bit of time, all the while Wendy learns to surf and befriends the others in the group, but a giant complication surfaces and Wendy leaves. She stops at a neighboring squatter-site meeting Pete's rival Jas. 
 Jas is a surfer, with a side business in fairy dust sales. In order to get close to Jas and inquire about her missing (possibly dead) brothers, Wendy accepts a hit of the dust. She's high for days and comes to consciousness on her friend's door step. Days go by and Jas comes to visit--promising to help her find her brothers. 
 Wendy leaves and travels to Witch Tree, where there are some giant revelations regarding her brothers, fairy dust, Jas, Pete and even Belle. Wendy is injured, and when she awakes from a coma it seems that the story has taken a whole different (and not very satisfying) direction. 
 I had actually liked the story until the last bit--but in the end I felt I had been duped, and not in a good way. The last three pages notwithstanding, the ending didn't satisfy. 
 There's a lot of grief, and little resolution, in my opinion. I didn't like the way Wendy's parents and closest friends treated her. They were either completely absent or completely smothering.

Her brother Jack, renown chef and restauranteur, took her in not only to his home but to his new extended family--his wife Lili hails from a close-knit Italian family. Among them, Tad DeLuca, Lili's cousin and a single man with tragic secrets. 
 Being the odd people out, Jules and Tad strike up a friendship. He's the rock she can lean on when Jack's busy working. Tad even takes birthing classes with Jules and attends the delivery of little Evan. Jules knows Tad's no good for her--he's rarely with the same woman twice--but she's been celibate since conception and lays a sloppy kiss on Tad one night, one he quickly rebuffs. 
 See, Tad knows he can't lose his heart to Jules--he doesn't have one to give. Not since his parents died in a car wreck ten years ago that was his fault. They remain friends, nonetheless. Fast-forward a year and Jules is helping out cooking at Tad's new wine bar. She's also ready to get ""out there"". A dating Jules is one facet of her Tad has no will to witness, however. His attraction to her begins to get the better of him--he even offers his ""services"" when he learns she's looking for a fling... 
 And, she turns him down. Their lives a so intertwined; his aunts babysit little Evan and his cousins are her closest gal pals--she doesn't want to tip the boat. 
 Still, they manage to seal the deal, leaving only awkwardness and hunger in its prime form. Tad even disrupts some of Jules' dates, that rascal. 
 In the end there's a lot of break-up-to-make-up. Evan's father learns of his existence and wants to meet his son--something Jules and Jack want to prevent. Yet, Tad's the voice of reason, even if it clashes with Jules' gut instinct. And, when the anniversary of Tad's parents' death rolls around, Jules is there to love him out of his drunken stupor. 
 I liked this one. A solid breeze-read. I generally like a little more conflict, the biggest obstacle to Jules and Tad getting together is their insecurity, but the friends-to-lovers trope was well-handled here. Jules is fun gal to get into. Tad is really a great guy--and head over heels for both Jules and Evan, but at times his ""voice"" rang more Brit than Chicago-Italian. (I'm probably most sensitive being that I am from Chicago, and of Italian descent.) I enjoyed how cooking was such a big part of the book--family meals are the lifeblood of Italians--and how it eventually brought Jules and Tad together.

 Spencer Bailey is as delicious a character as that cover portrays. For. Real. 
 Spencer never takes lovers when he's in season--he got burned bad by a groupie-turned-complainant when he was 19, and he's still a bit shell-shocked. A man doesn't ""get over"" an accusation of statutory rape all that easily. 
 While on his season break, Spencer's looking for a discreet partner--preferably a woman who doesn't know him as an athlete. His plans get derailed when his grandfather, and only living relative, suffers a heart attack during a walk. Thankfully, a beautiful (single) woman--Caitlyn--happened by and began CPR. Caitlyn's used to rescue work; she works for an international aide organization and makes a living teaching women how to build proper latrines in refugee camps. 
 Both Spencer and his grandfather are smitten with Caitlyn. And, Spencer loves that she's neither local, nor a rugby fan. This American is a refreshing breath, except for her little quirks--like biting him the first time he kisses her. Oh, and head butting him the second. 
 It seems Caitlyn's not such a suave would-be lover. She's got her reasons; mainly an unpunched V-card. Usually I get frustrated when I read a story about a late-20's gal with no sexual experience, but Caitlyn's backstory is so good I actually cheer it on. Especially seeing how this changes Spencer--for the better. Who says a 30ish prime athlete can't be celibate? 
 Uh, nobody V! This is a romance! 
 Fear not, friends. We got a scorcher of a romance, here. It simply takes a bit more time to fully develop. And, when it does the developments are extreme. In a very god, and very bad way. Caitlyn tries to protect her heart from the devastating Englishman, but becoming a part of his world means embracing a part of her history she's tried hard to forget: violence. 
 See, Caitlyn wasn't always a bystander to domestic abuse. And there's a five fingered reason why Big 'Ol Spencer gives her the shakes for the first part of the book. I absolutely adored Spencer's compassion, and his restraint. Still, seeing the brutality of rugby sends Caitlyn to the loo--and it's not the only major discovery she makes at the rugby stadium. There's something so completely endearing in this fledgling relationship. Spencer's ready to this to a whole new level--and gets the perfect excuse to do so, only to have his own past blow up in his face. 
 Ugh. I just wanted to cry when they left the registrar's office without that marriage license! 
 Good thing? Caitlyn comes to terms with the horror of her past, and it's the breakthrough she needed. We get a super satisfying HEA... 
 I loved the Brit lingo. I loved the slowly developed romance. I cringed in agony with Spencer each time Caitlyn pulled back, or left. And, I cherished the stand-up guy he was throughout. In real life there's a sex scandal a week with athletes; while most are well-deserved, it true that some are not. I enjoyed the perspective of a falsely-accused man dealing with the aftermath YEARS after his accuser recanted. Plus, the circumspect way Spencer lived his life following that incident really showed his determination to be a better man--definitely a trait to admire. 
 Caitlyn was a real treat for a late-20's ingenue. A complete character with real issues, and she dealt with them heroically. Loved her.",Mon Apr 21 06:22:58 -0700 2014,Mon Apr 21 06:23:36 -0700 2014,,,1,0

 This is the twelfth book in the series, and it's main story centers around Wrath, naturally. He is, after all, the king. 
 At this point in the series there are many plot lines that are in various degrees of conflict/convergence. The book centers on the ousting of Wrath as King by the glymera, the aristocracy of vampirekind. See they have another person in mind--Ichan, a distant cousin of Wrath's and through him the warrior Xcor plans to rule. The legal mumbo-jumbo of long forgotten vamp lore states that kings must be of pure blood--and any progeny of Wrath and his Queen, Beth, would be 1/4 human. 
 Wrath is more than willing to not be King. He's tired of the constant pressure. And now he's terrified that Beth is planning to bring on her own needing, or time of fertility. Wrath abhors the idea of risking Beth's life in pregnancy. It sparks such a rift that Beth actually walks out. 
 Now, Wrath has to figure out how to deal, and he's gotta get it handled quickly because there's a lotta hormones in the air. That's right. Beth needs, and Wrath caves. It's all good, though. And Wrath tears out his hair in worry--about his wife and unborn, as well as the throne. At least, he doesn't have to worry about the kingship for long, he's deposed by the usurper. For roughly a day. Won't tell you how he got his crown back but it was NEARLY bloodless. Funny how someone taking away what one didn't want makes a person want it all the more. 
 80's hair-band Cinderella had a song about it.... 
 Fear not! The HEA is freaking stupendous. So much love for Wrath, even if he was kinda King Prick for a few chapters. 
 Side plots: Assail is punch-drunk in love with the cat burglar Marisol. So much so that he destroys a good bit of his drug pipeline to recover her from the deadly possession of Benloise. Their connection is fierce, and needy. It is rough watching their unfinished business. Will be seeing more of them, for sure--not only because Assail's using Lessers to sell his drugs on the street. 
 Via flashback, we get a lot of Wrath's father's story in this one. I really enjoyed learning more about that short-lived reign--and gaining a possible reason for Wrath's blindness--an in utero injury. Fascinating how the intrigues of that court played out in Wrath's own timeline. 
 Let's not forget the Chosen Layla and Xcor have a serious attraction. Will she commit treason to be with him? Or, are her overtures the key to peace between the Black Dagger Brotherhood and the rival Band of Bastards? Let's say this: I'm looking forward to Xcor getting his. Next book, maybe. 
 And finally, Trez still hasn't submitted to the s'Hibhe to take his place as stud to the Queen's daughter. He's over the nameless sex--focused, unfortunately, on the Chosen Selena. Selena returns his interest, but at what price? His impurity will not keep him from being extracted, and iAm can only keep the executioner at bay so long. In typical Trez fashion, he sweet-talks and sexes his way out of the most dire parts of his predicament. For now. 
 Still a lot of plot to build the next episode on. And, we had virtually NO Lesser involvement in this book. Would not expect that trend to bear out much longer. 
 It's a satisfying read for BDB fans. Some excellent romance mixed in with the political intrigue and harrowing captures. Plot moves on the trademark Ward pace: fast. If only her next books came out as quickly... :)",Thu Apr 17 07:18:10 -0700 2014,Thu Apr 17 07:19:44 -0700 2014,,,0,0

 OMG. From the start I was sucked into the ""When Harry Met Sally"" back-and-forth of the prose. Brief, reflective vignettes preface each chapter, with the witty banter of Levi and Macallan harkening back to times of their greatest comradarie, and conflict. 
 Told in alternating point-of-view, we meet long-haired surfer Levi as a new student in a small Milwaukee junior high. Macallan's a pretty, but withdrawn, girl--still bottling the grief of her mother's death--called to serve as Levi's guide. He's so forlorn, sitting alone at lunch, that the reserved Macallan invites him to join her and her friends. See, both of them are a bit adrift, and they recognize that kindred sense of 'not-fitting' in each other. 
 Of course, the source of their not fitting is different; Macallan self-isolates seeking to be free of the pitying stares, while Levi craves to find his way in to the larger society. Despite these differences, they become friends. Macallan really craves family as she has no siblings and her house is so silent without her mother. Her dad tries hard, but he works a lot and her uncle is a minimal support, by virtue of his developmental delay. Levi relies on Macallan as a friend throughout seventh grade, but in eighth grade we get our first divergence: Emily, Macallan's childhood BFF begins to find Levi attractive. And thus, the wedge is driven. 
 Sure, Levi and Macallan are still friendly, but there's no balm to soothe 'Third Wheel Syndrome"". Nor, is there a guide that helps these young teens deal with manipulating friends and cheaters... 
 Throughout all this, Levi and Macallan weather the conflict. In fact, it seems clear that they are 'an item' though they never date. Not in eighth grade, nor freshman year, or sophomore year either. They just have one of those friendships that is so solid they have all the inside jokes. And, they can finish each other's sentences. So it's natural that, when yet another of Levi's romantic entanglements implodes, Macallan is right there to pick up the pieces. Only, this time, there's something physical between them. A spark that Levi won't deny, but Macallan never acknowledges. 
 And this eats Levi alive. So much so that he needs space to mend his bruised ego, and heart. 
 Of course, by the time he gets around to telling Macallan the truth of his feelings, she's moving on. To Ireland. (For the summer...) It's a long eight weeks of soul-searching for Macallan and she's almost ready to open her heart to Levi, only, well...he got himself another girl. 
 Yeah. (I was crushed too, Macallan baby!) 
 Ugh. I wanted to just toss my iPad. Really. 
 But, I trudged forth and stayed the course, trusting that my heart, er, I mean Macallan's heart, would recover. And, it sorta did. Not without a whole lotta clueless meandering--and at times downright nastiness--on Levi's part. Still, when the call came that Levi needed her, Macallan was right there--to let the call slip to voicemail. 
 What? You didn't think she'd just pine away for a jerk-face forever, did you? 
 Oh. But, she WAS the friend he needed, right when he needed her. And the end, as they say, was HEA. 
 Just. Loved. Swooned. The angst was churning in my gut from the get-go. It took me a tiny minute to figure out the two voices--mainly on those vignettes--but the characters were so lush. So vibrant. Macallan's grief killed me. Levi's overwhelming desire to fit in--it took me right back to high school. Recommend to all lovers of YA. It's wholly innocent, so okay for those reading up. Not sure they'll catch onto the WHMS theme, but it think the story will still resonate.

 So, wedding planner extraordinaire, Mia has been jilted, poorly, by text message no less, and she's wallowing. Her friends convince her to take the honeymoon trip to Paris, regardless. She puts up a fight, then settles for anger--vowing to enjoy Paris in a way she never would have with her ex, Tucker. 
 See, Tucker is one Grade A Jackass. In truth, I almost suspected he was a closet gay, the way he was so controlling about their sex life, and all. (That notion didn't bear fruit, but it kept me guessing...) 
 Alone in Paris, Mia tries to find her groove. She visits some of her checklist of sights, but she's overwhelmed with lovers. And, furiously jealous of them. She has decided Tucker was probably right about calling off the wedding--not that she excuses his manner of doing so--but it's hard to take all the romance when she feels so scorned. Deciding to return home early, Mia pops into a 'Canadian-themed sports bar' and attempts to drown her loneliness in a deep glass of Red on her first, and final night, in Paris. 
 The sexy bartender, Lucas, makes more than small talk, he cuts straight to the quick. She can't possibly leave Paris after only one day! No! She must stay at least one more day and visit the attractions with a helpful guide--himself. 
 A bit tipsy, she agrees. 
 Their day on the town proves to be a whole different kind of experience for Mia. Not likely to find lovers smooching in a graveyard, is she? And, Lucas is delicious. He's half-American/half-French, so they converse easily. He's also smart--his career is in teaching, in New York. He's on summer holiday and he was working the bar to assist his brother. 
 Did I perhaps mention the hotness of this book? Mia and Lucas do hop in the sack. And the shower. And the kitchen counter, floor, couch, vineyard, picnic blanket, tubs. For crying out loud, a wall, or three, may have been molested in the scripting of their smexytimes! What happens in Paris, folks, changes Mia. Opens her in a way that releases her inner sex demon (Er, figuratively. This isn't paranormal...). She does stay the original duration of her trip, soon discovering that Lucas is absolutely perfect in every way, save one. He never wants to marry. 
 Is that a deal-breaker for our jilted wedding-planner? Perhaps. Especially when Tucker tries to reconnect, promising Mia the happy marriage she had dreamed of, from half the world away. 
 FRENCHED is a fantastic, fun, sexy read. Mia, angry and dejected at first, grows into the sexy confident woman she never was with Tucker. Lucas is a total dreamboat. Both have real, honest, reservations for turning this fling into something...more. Problem is, they fit so well, it's hard to abandon this new and thrilling connection. The writing style is playful and interesting. I flew through the book. 
 And then I went back for seconds... ;)",Wed Mar 26 05:40:24 -0700 2014,Mon Apr 21 18:45:12 -0700 2014,,,0,0

One night she and her boyfriend, Jared, have a car wreck and are accosted by two of these shadow men. All of the shadow people are sexy to the nth degree. I'm not exactly sure what they ARE exactly, but their mind controlling pheromones generally have the humans tearing their clothes off. Exhibit A: Jared...a little startling for Sasha to observe two men sex up her boyfriend in the alley. 
 Sasha, however, is immune. 
 Sasha wakes up the next morning--fully-clothed--in bed with a naked, sexually-ravenous Jared. She knows something is very wrong, but her memories of the previous night are spotty and she doesn't remember their actual encounter until the next day. At this point Sasha is on a mission to find the shadow people and figure out why she sees them. 
 The leader of these shadow people, Stephan, is a temptation Sasha can barely resist. Of course, the shadow people are embroiled in a war with Mage, and Sasha seems to have some magical ability to repel the forces attacking Stephan's people. 
 Now, she's an asset--and under the protection of Stephen's minions, like Charles, one of the Jared-Bangers. Charles is a playful, amorous, dim-witted body-guard whom Sasha seems to have no trouble eluding. He provides some real humor into the dark mystery of the Shadow people. 
 Of course there's a few harrowing twists that leave Sasha nearly dead--if only someone super strong and sexy had the cure? *narrows eyes on Stephen* 
 It's an interesting, sensual start to a series and super quick read. Not for the prudish. Contains copious copulation, consensual, or not.",Sun Mar 23 09:15:07 -0700 2014,Sun Mar 23 09:16:04 -0700 2014,Sun Feb 23 00:00:00 -0800 2014,,0,0

 Prenna James is a high school student in New York in 2014, but she was born in 2078. In her time the Earth has suffered extreme shifts in climate due to global warming and melted polar ice. There are shortages of food and raw materials, and a mosquito-borne blood plague has devastated the world population. Prenatal has traveled back in time with her mother and nearly 1000 other futurists in the hope of altering some aspects of the present to fix the future. 
 At least those were the initial goals. Now, Prenna is sure that the powers above aren't doing anything but controlling the time travelers and murdering any of the group that doesn't conform. All the travelers must adhere to a set of twelve rules to ensure that they do not alter time too much, or infect the 'time natives' which strange and foreign microbes that could trigger plagues in this time. 
 Ethan Jarvis is a math/physics whiz in Prenna's classes. He's also a time native, and someone Prenna is forbidden to have and 'physical or emotional intimacy' with--according to the rules. She, and all her fellow travelers, are under surveillance by concealed devices, and when she steps out of line, Prenna is reprimanded by her 'counselors'. 
 Prenna tries to adhere to the rules, but she desires Ethan. And, he is quite the dashing rescuer. Especially when Prenna is taken away for speaking to a homeless man who turns out to be a fellow traveler, an undocumented one, who happens to know where a fork in time was created that brought about her dire future. Ethan saves Prenna from captivity and they follow the clues from the homeless man to discover the root cause of her future was the murder of a promising green energy scientist. 
 Now, Ethan and Prenna must stop the scientist from being killed--while also fighting the attraction between them. But, when Prenna finds evidence that Ethan is going to die in the process of saving the scientist she needs to choose between telling him his fate, and risking the fate of perhaps...the world. 
 No, it's not as dire as all that, silly! But it is rather harrowing. 
 I enjoyed the writing. I enjoyed the story. I liked Ethan, (perhaps too much)...but Prenna makes some dumb choices that irked me. In the end, she makes the right choice, and as much as it broke my heart, I'm glad she did the right thing. 
 Note: heart only broken because I wanted to see Ethan happy, and he wasn't. But I expect he'll get over it. 
 It's an innocent tale suitable for YA readers. If nothing else, I hope it helps young readers to envision a hot climate future we can do more to avoid...but I'm not gonna get all preachy 'bout it.",Tue Mar 18 11:54:26 -0700 2014,Tue Mar 18 12:18:49 -0700 2014,,,0,0

 Tony DiMarco is a private eye investigating the suspicious death of Marilyn White. The coroner said she OD'ed on prescription drugs and wine, her husband's alibi was rock-solid, yet Marilyn's parent's don't believe that Marilyn would kill herself. The detective who handled the case, an old buddy if Tony's when he was on the force always had a sneaking suspicion about the therapist Marilyn had been seeing, Dr. Jack Halloran--a sex therapist. 
 Casing the doc's ""bedside manner"" Tony is stunned to find the doc irresistibly tempting sexually, but he can most assuredly rule the doc out as a sexual partner of Marilyn's. Turns out this decorated war veteran isn't only a sensitive physician, he's also gay. Now Tony has to figure out if the cause of Marilyn's death was as simple as it seemed. 
 Jack Halloran is damaged goods. The scars of his tours in Iraq as a battle surgeon are emotional, as well as physical, and he's sure no gay man will have him. Worse, he's unmistakably attracted to his newest erectile dysfunction patient, Tony DeMarco. He's determined to get a handle on Tony's dysfunction--and not just in the medical sense. Except, doing so would be a gross misconduct on his part. 
 Both men struggle with their attraction, Tony pursuing Jack as much as he is answers for Marilyn's parents. When he finds out the truth behind her death his resolve to become more than a patient to Jack is high on the To-Do list, but a chance encounter ends up shattering their Doctor-Patient relationship. Will it also dash any chance of happiness for them? 
 The pace of this novel is perfect. The alternating point-of-view satisfied, with intimate glimpses of both Tony-and his deep family ties--and Jack, with his deep commitment to duty. Both men struggle to feel whole in the face of lost careers and physical shortcomings. The resolution of the crime investigation is concise and clear, as is the attraction and escalation of their relationship. I really enjoyed the tension, and the physical developments between Jack and Tony--who was terrified and surprised of his feelings for Jack, at first. 
 There were some delicious smexytimes, and an HEA now that Tony's sexual dysfunction seems cured.",Sun Mar 09 19:08:30 -0700 2014,Sun Mar 09 19:35:45 -0700 2014,,,3,0

 THE TRUTH ABOUT ALICE should be on every teen library's shelves. 
 Alice Franklin has not had an easy life. Abandoned by her father and neglected by her mother, she's had to fight her way forward in the her small Texas town of Healy. 
 The story is told from several character's point-of-view as a series of frank discussions with the reader-in some way they are confessions, and highly personal. 
 Alice is accused by the school's football star, Brandon, of having sex with himself and another boy, Tommy, at a summer party. In the same night, at the same time. Now, Alice wasn't super squeaky-clean, and everyone knows this. But his rumor lands her squarely in Slut Status. Alice is a beautiful girl, and many other girls are jealous of her-including her best friend Kelsie-so, it's particularly easy to tear Alice down socially. 
 Elaine is the most popular girl in high school, and she has been on/off with Brandon for years. She helps spread the rumor, and it's perpetuated by Kelsie-whose one ambition is to stay popular, even if it costs her Alice's friendship. This vile rumor may have faded and Alice's life returned to normal, but Brandon dies in a car wreck a few weeks later. 
 Josh, Brandon's best friend, survived the crash and tells people that, while he and Brandon had been drunk at the time, it was distracting texts from Alice that may have contributed to the accident. 
 So, Alice isn't just a slut. She's a killer. And the newest pariah of Healy. 
 Completely shunned, Alice seems to fade into herself. People notice, of course, but only the town genius/misfit Kurt seems to care. He offers his help to keep Alice from failing Algebra II, mostly because he's lovesick over her, but also because he knows the rumors aren't true. 
 The unique story-telling eventually reveals the full truth of Brandon's tragic death and Alice's role in it. What is particularly poignant is the complete believability of the story. No matter what outrageous tale is told about Alice, it is fully acceptable, unquestioned, gossip fodder. 
 Growing up in the technological age, rumors spread instantly via text and Facebook. Surely, this book captures the significance of a person's lack of privacy, and also the futility of rising against such an information stream. The language is clear and appropriate to the genre. The easy style of the book is sure to captivate youth readers, and the subject matter has resonance that teens will appreciate.

 I was trolling NetGalley this week-looking for the fun, the new, the different-when I came across this Contemporary YA M/M romance from debut novelist Michael Barakiva. It takes teen angst to a whole new, humorous, educational level... 
 Fourteen year old Armenian-American Aleksander is weeks away from the end of his freshman year. For him, summer is all about tennis camp and a family trip to Niagara Falls and hanging with his BFF, Becky, and he can't wait. 
 Oh, the cruel whims of parents! 
 It seems that Alek is doing okay in his classes, but not nearly good enough to remain in the Honors track-unless he retakes English and Algebra in summer school. So, those plans of summer fun and tennis? POOF! 
 And Alek is downright salty* over it. (*in this context 'salty' means rude and angry, or so my teen son tells me...) 
 But, honor his parents' wishes he does, because being Armenian means, well, I guess it means doing more. Alex's parents definitely lay a guilt trip so thick a water buffalo might drown in it. See, Alek's family is very tight-knit. He wants to assert his independence, but he's smothered by his folks, unable to even pick out his own clothing. So he doesn't stand a chance of avoiding summer school if that's what his parents demand. 
 While at summer school Alek meets the notorious skater-boy, rabble-rousing, food-fight-starting Ethan Novick, a junior. Ethan is the embodiment of rebellious teen in Alek's admiring eyes. He's not sure why Ethan draws his attention, but Alek cannot seem to get him out of his thoughts. Confessing to Becky, Alek learns she harbors a secret crush for Alek creating a bit of discomfort. 
 On the way to school one morning, Alek and Ethan meet at the NYC-bound train stop, and Ethan drags Alek off to The City for a daylong hooky adventure, the like of which Alek has dreamed of but never had. He and Ethan bond until Ethan uses the F-word: Faggot. Alek isn't gay, but he's thoroughly offended and stands up to Ethan over it-at least until Ethan explains why it's A-Okay for him to use that particular slur-Ethan's gay. 
 Alek is stunned, but still friendly. In fact, to make up for his mistake he creates a gift that wins Ethan completely over, and Alek begins to realize why Ethan is such a big focus in his mind...attraction. But, he struggles with this new wrinkle in his identity. Alek's had a couple girlfriends before, after all. And he never felt attracted to boys-Ethan excepted. When they actually kiss, Alek is blown away by the rightness of his feelings, the overwhelming rush of desire. 
 This relationship must stay on the down-low, however, because Alek is certain his Orthodox Armenian parents will never accept a gay child. Good thing their vacation is looming. Family friends convince Alek's parents to leave him unattended while they travel-a point Alek had argued for-and now he has an empty home and a curious boyfriend. They skip school again for another NYC visit and Alek indulges in his freedom, getting a new haircut and updating his wardrobe from the geek-chic clothes his mother buys. 
 Do I need to tell you that Alek's parents return home at an inopportune time? Yeah. Drama. 
 But the end is a super HEA that satisfies. I adored this book for its humor, and its cultural grounding. I really learned a lot about Armenian culture (and food!) and history that, lamented often by the Armenian characters, is largely denied and forgotten except by those within the Armenian community. Observing Alek accept his sexuality was refreshing. His wit and observations had me in stitches, even if I'm one of those Americans! Becky and Ethan are solid supporting characters, and Alek's over-involved parents are real people, not cardboard caricatures. They really shine in their love and sincerity. 
 Overall, the book is meant for teen readers and I'd highly recommend it. There are brief encounters between Alek and Ethan that amount to some heavy make-outs, but nothing more. Having no knowledge of Armenian culture and life, I was pleased to recognize some similarities to the Jewish experiences with which I am familiar. I think any reader could relate to Alek's family and their quirks. Well, unless you are Turkish. There seems to be a decidedly anti-Turk sentiment within the Armenian community represented here-and its historical significance is fully described within the book. 
 The author, Michael Barakiva, has really injected a lot of history into the novel without making it preachy. In fact, his deft hand actually calls into question the validity of holding onto past prejudice as opposed to pursuing future happiness. As a result, uneasy truces are made that support moving forward with love and acceptance, even when a Turk is involved.",Thu Mar 06 07:31:15 -0800 2014,Thu Mar 06 07:33:35 -0800 2014,,,0,0

 Everything about Paige Morrison is loud. Her voice, her manner of dress, her manner. Even being an artist is too wild for the sleepy community in which she finds herself. 
 UNDONE is a newly released contemporary romance by Shannon Richard. 
 Like many twenty-somethings, Paige is recently unemployed. She has relocated from Philadelphia to tiny Mirabelle, Florida a sleepy gulf coast town to move in with her retired parents now that her boyfriend has decided she isn't The One. Deep down, Paige knew this--but it's still hard to accept. Even harder to accept is the stodginess of the neighbors and the general lack of friendliness she finds in her new locale. 
 At least, until Brendan King rides in on his blazing tow truck. [Did I mention Paige's Jeep has decided to crap out as well? That girl has some rotten luck!] 
 Brendan King is no stranger to being on the outs in Mirabelle. His mother was a single teen, and she later had a second child out-of-wedlock, the shameless hussy! Of course, she also died young of breast cancer, so some of her chief critics silenced out of respect for the dead. That doesn't mean Brendan's forgotten how it feels to be a pariah. Seeing a kindred spirit--and a damn sexy lady--riding shotgun in his wrecker, well, he decides to pay it forward. 
 He seeks our a job for Paige, and they continue to encounter each other--in the most delicious ways. It's hard for Paige to get over her insecurities--especially when an ""anonymous"" gossip blogger begins spreading rumors about Paige's wantonness in Mirabelle's e-community--but Brendan wears her down. 
 It seems that life is picking up for these two--they do move in together and plan a wedding when we get some further family drama. Brendan is called upon to hide a big secret--one that may tear their relationship apart. In the end, Paige learns that peace is within one's self to find--and holding the people she loves close will always ensure that she fits in her world. 
 As far as a romance, this is on the breezy side. Not too smexy. The majority of the conflict lay in emotional insecurity, which is natural and not melodramatic. I had some problem with how long Paige held a grudge against Brendan for something outside his control--but the resolution was adequate--and acceptable. The locale and main players are clearly outlined--with an obvious plan to build more stories centering on this group of characters. It a solid read.

 Trey Grey is a college student, and a prostitiute. He has been turning tricks since he was a young teen, prodded on this course by his physically and sexually abusive step-father. Trey is a survivor of some of the most horrific exploitation one could imagine, and now on his own he turns tricks to supplement his scholarship money. He's a pretty high class hooker, with a semi-regular clientele of well-to-do closeted men, women and pairs. 
 He also suffers nightmares, interactive episodes that trigger self harm through OCD scrubbing. After one particularly bad episode, Trey becomes psychologically catatonic for five days and is discovered soiled in his bedclothes. The treatment to return him to functioning includes mandatory therapy. After his first visit, Trey meets Justin at a nearby restaurant. They share a meal and Justin invites Trey to the party he's attending, warning Trey that it's a sex party... 
 In this event, Trey actually experiences arousal of his own. He's been a sex trade worker so long he's inured to the arousal, but Justin turns him on as no one ever had. Justin is emotionally battered, too, however, and Trey flees. Temporarily. 
 Between these two broken souls, they recognize a need, an ability to smooth the rough edges. Justin is able to assuage Trey's nightmares--not always in time. 
 Trey is still a prostitute, but Justin and he reach an understanding. They agree to live together, as soon as the semester ends. There are some serious issues between them, not the least of which is Trey's self-harming behavior, and Justin's struggles with depression, however, in the end it seems as though they are better for having each other to lean on. Through therapy, and opening up to Justin, Trey comes to terms with some deeply repressed memories that may even be healed in the near future. 
 The book is written to be the first in a series, but ends in a way that is complete. No cliffhanger. 
 The material within is as advertised: DARK. There is no escaping the horror of Trey's habitual rape at the hands of his stepfather and johns. He is also brutalized by his current johns, and himself. It is really gut-wrenching in its scope. I had trouble with some of the editing--there were numerous grammatical and spelling errors that did detract from my reading enjoyment. This aside, the story is powerful and compelling and I would consider reading the second book to find out if Trey can conquer his demons enough to find solace and love, with Justin, and for himself.",Thu Feb 27 09:35:21 -0800 2014,Thu Feb 27 10:02:53 -0800 2014,,,3,0

 Levi and Pixie are long-time friends. They've grown up around each other, by virtue of Pixie being BFF's with Levi's younger sister, Charity. Pixie's life hasn't been good. Her mother--a teen mom filled with regret over the loss of her youth and boyfriend--she has resented Pixie and been emotionally abusive from a young age. Needing love, Pixie took refuge with Charity's close-knit family and grew to love them all in return--especially Levi who was her steadfast hero. Just as they seem to connect, there's a horrific accident. Levi and Pixie are plagued with guilt and shame, and Charity is dead. 
 Fast forward 10 months: Levi's family has broken up. He's dropping out of college and none of the family has spoken to Pixie. Isolated without Charity and her family's love, Pixie refuses to spend her summer at home with her own mother. Instead, she turns to her aunt for a summer job--without knowing that Levi's already living at her Bed & Breakfast and working as a handyman. Now Pixie's longtime crush and former friend is her next-door neighbor. 
 Levi hasn't handled the implosion of his family well, but it's even harder for him to see Pixie--the one girl he absolutely adores who bears physical scars from his bad decision--in such close quarters; they share a bathroom. Desperate to talk with her, but unwilling to venture into serious territory, he stoops to antagonizing her, stupid tricks like using up all the hot water in the shower to irritate her into conversation. 
 Their friends work to get each of them to return to their pre-tragedy life plans, but it's so difficult to let go of the guilt. Still, their close interactions lead to mini confessions, tiny breakthroughs, and finally the healing emotional purge they both need. Building on these small successes, Levi is empowered to contact his parents and let them know how betrayed he has felt since they moved away from him and each other. This opens the lines of communication leading to a reconciliation for their family. 
 Just when we think Levi and Pixie are going to make it, another curve ball--in the form of a college transfer--gets tossed out. Will Pixie move to New York and start over? Or, will she stay in Arizona with the only family she's ever loved? 
 It's a strong story with plenty of snarky humor and personal tragedy. Levi and Pixie make a wonderful couple, and it's easy to see how their plans got so jumbled. Dealing with trauma is complicated, and many people pull away from those they love in an act of self-defense. For Pixie, her abandonment by Charity's family is just as hard to accept as it is for Levi. It was good to see that all of these relationships were repaired during the summer. I liked the story. The sexual tension between Pixie and Levi is palpable. Watchingtheir love story come together, and apart and together again was very satisfying. Due to the alternating point of view I could feel their pain and triumph.

 Matty Marcus is a World Champion figure skater recovering from a back in jury and a disappointing showing at the Olympics. He is on the verge of bankrupt and needs money to begin training for the next Olympics two years away. One of his fans offers him a lot of money to house-sit for her Montana ranch and horses while on a six-month trip to Australia/Asia. Having no better prospects, Matty agrees. 
 Problem is, Matty's flamboyantly gay. He, perhaps, never says this explicitly in his interviews, but he wears women's clothes and shoes and makeup, so...it's pretty obvious. He can't really un-gay himself, even if the judges don't favor it. 
 Matty's a bit afraid that he'll run up against some gay bashing in his new remote locale, but, what he finds is his new neighbor--the man who owns the next ranch over, is himself gay. Rob is much more the burly, athletic male specimen, but he's drawn to Matty and they engage in a passionate affair. This passion is tinged with frustration, however, knowing that Matty's time is fixed. Still, Matty bonds with Rob's son, Ben--a pre-teen boy interested in figure skating. Matty relates well with Ben, recognizing the boy has size and power that Matty lacks. Masculinity is now being highly regarded in the figure skating world, and though Matty has talent, he can't change his stature. 
 Rob gets Matty. He sees how he struggles--to maintain his weight, his focus, with his fear of failure and his self-loathing for previous failures--and through some Dom/sub interactions Matty experiences an emotional purging. They are deeply connected with one another, more so than either had been with another man before. 
 Still their time comes to an end and Matty asks for a clean break--knowing he will devote himself 24/7 for the next two years to his dream of Olympic gold. Because of this, Matty is, in part, better able to focus on skating as a means to bury his grief over letting Rob go. 
 Matty trains relentlessly and achieves his Olympic dream...sort of. Even years later, he struggles with the loss of Rob, and contemplates giving up his competitive career. While recuperating from yet another sidelining injury, Matty discovers Ben in training for junior figure skating competitions. Matty connects with Rob again, but Rob is unwilling to pick up Matty's pieces. Again. Rob can't bear any more diet management and ten hour training days, seeing the love of his life sacrifice everything for figure skating, when the rewards are so slim. 
 About 3/4 of the way through this book I just started crying. 
 See, I've been around elite athletes--people training for the Olympics/World Championships. Not figure skaters, but intense, driven individuals who will sacrifice everything to attain their goals of competing/winning at this level. Moving across country to train with an esteemed coach. Families investing their entire financial resources behind the training of a promising athlete. The sacrifices Matty makes seem very much in line with those people. The constant training, the constant diet management, forgoing relationships in order to ""stay focused""; this is the hallmark of many an elite athlete. It was so hard to read Matty's struggle for that reason--because I know this is happening right now with talented athletes who are great, and perhaps--like Matty--amazing, and yet, who will not see the top of the podium nonetheless. 
 This book, by the way, is not an indictment of elite sports. It is a realistic portrayal of the sacrifices some athletes will make to achieve. I was satisfied that Matty really learns what is most important in his world; what he is willing to settle for, and that which will bring him the most happiness. 
 It is solid contemporary story, a come-back story, a romance with scorching love scenes and some BDSM. Rob and Matty are blistering together, and their short Montana love affair changes each of them in unexpected ways.",Mon Feb 17 13:06:49 -0800 2014,Mon Feb 17 13:58:52 -0800 2014,Mon Feb 17 14:18:31 -0800 2014,,3,0

Emma is a strong female lead--determined to make her own way. She's had to for a while now. Her parents divorced when she was young and each started a new family, leaving Emma...on the outskirts, if you will. She's working her way through law school and delights in her personal eye candy--Alaric Canon. His brutal temperament is nothing less than fierce and try as she might, she can't get his gaze to land on her. Not ever. 
 So, she decides to change things up. Enter the 'classy lady' role she has seen Canon's dates wear. Forgo her bright plumage and beige-down. 
 I'm a big blender full of subdued. So beige Helen Hunt would 
 be envious. Total corporate drone, all business. 
 Plan forecast: Nothing but black, navy, and beige, with 
 scattered gray and a slim chance of red. 
 Her first attempt to begin an early morning exercise regimen is divine: 
 My feet hit the cold hardwood floor and I fight the urge 
 to creep back under my duvet. Sleep is my friend. 
 Not as faithful a friend as cellulite. It is so loyal. 
 Always there. 
 OMG. I nearly wet myself. Emma's acerbic wit and Spartan diction had me in absolute fits. Especially when she learns her boss is installing her as Canon's newest Personal Assistant. 
 I see the look she has leveled at me. She's terrified. 
 Rebecca. 
 Terrified. 
 I may soil myself. 
 No, Emma's not 'a blip' anymore; she's front-and-center on the radar screen, and Canon is certainly a trial. He barely even speaks to her--leaving her notes everywhere telling her what to do and how he wants it done. Having observed his antics for the past year, however, Emma does more than hold her own--she shines. So much so that she's indispensable on the acquisition trip Canon must take to plan the merger of their struggling company with another. 
 The trip is uproarious, with Emma stashing grounds of Canon's favorite coffee in her luggage so she can ensure a perfect brew in the morning, and cobbling together the wardrobe of a professional business woman gleaned from all her friends' closets. Suffering the simpering adoration of Canon's admirer at the other company unhinges Emma in a way she has never been before. Taking matters--and bits of Canon's anatomy--into her own hands solidifies Emma's place in Canon's mind. The woman is practically a closet dominatrix... 
 It's an interesting love story, one where the reader knows Canon's totally into Emma, but Emma can't bring herself to believe it, which I enjoy. The trip drags on, and between them Emma is the brute--shoving Canon away, sure she's going to get hurt. Falling for Canon wasn't in the plan. 
 But getting rid of a man like Alaric Canon proves to be twice as difficult as gaining his attention in the first place. 
 I just loved this book. Emma's so dead-pan in her cutting humor I was shocked into laughter nearly as often as I was tickled into it. The smexytimes are well-written--descriptive without being pages long and sloppy with it. The two characters are brash, and I delighted in seeing the demanding Canon tamed in the bedroom. So very fun, indeed.",Mon Feb 17 07:31:29 -0800 2014,Mon Feb 17 07:34:46 -0800 2014,,,2,0

 That's one part of the premise in Sarah Mlynowski's contemporary YA novel DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. 
 What's this book about? 
 Twenty-two students at a public high school in NYC (Tribeca, a rather affluent neighborhood) are given a flu vaccine. The next day most of them can read minds. Over the next few days, they all develop this ability. 
 With consequences. 
 My Review: 
 I devoured this title. At first, the style was off-putting. I'm always in search of the narrative character, the viewpoint, through which the story comes--but that's impossible here. Because the story is told from the collective ""We"" as a past-tense rehash of how these ordinary kids became infected with the extraordinary. Talk about a side-effect! After that quick adaptation on my part, the story rolled. 
 While there are twenty-two high school sophomores within this hive mind, there are several who carry the story. 
 Timid Olivia, who is as big a germaphobe and hypochondriac as her mother, is the first to notice her new telepathy. Unfortunately, it happens while she's standing in front of her class preparing to deliver a speech on Lyme Disease. Yeah, she faints--but not before alerting a fellow classmate, Pi, that she has telepathy. 
 Pi's brilliant. Second in the class, and pining for first, she's determined to be extraordinary. Imagine her dismay in learning that her telepathy isn't that unique. Of course, Pi's the first one to figure out how to use his gift to her advantage. Ever the strategist, she begins to position herself in closer proximity to Number 1, in the hopes of overtaking him. 
 See, while they can hear other people's thoughts, there are some rules to this ability: 
 First, the closer they are to a person, the louder those thoughts are heard. If there are people in the way, they buffer the thought signals, diluting them. Also, vision is important. If a person has his or her eyes closed, their thoughts are unhearable. Likewise, for the new telepaths, closing their own eyes shuts out the noise of thoughts around them. Glasses can magnify the ability, while dark glasses mute it. It's an interesting story frame, and it's exploited by many of the characters at different points. 
 Some of the telepaths want to exploit their position immediately. 
 Take Tess. She's bears a secret crush for her best guy-friend Teddy. He's single and they hang out a lot, and she wants to know if her feelings are returned. Should she listen in? Heck, yeah, she does. But one can't unhear those thoughts--and Tess isn't exactly thrilled with Teddy after a bit. 
 And what about those secrets? Mackensie, class pretty girl, is dating Cooper, class sweetheart. But when he was away at camp this summer she had a fling with Bennett--an older boy in her building. It's something she's kept inside, but now everyone knows, except Cooper, who is the last to develop telepathy. 
 Poor Cooper. His luck just goes from bad to worse when he goes home a gets a taste of parent's thoughts. 
 That's the thing about telepathy. While some kids are grade boosting, others are having complete personal meltdowns. Yet, they all agree to keep this ability secret. They form the hive mind of Espies, and attempt to behave as normally as possible to throw off any suspicion. Pi designates herself as the leader of the group, because Pi is a take-charge gal. Others, like Tess and Olivia, emerge from their ""shells"" to become more confident individuals--without being outright dishonest--now that they can see how their private fears hampered their happiness. 
 Soon, the CDC comes sniffing 'round the hallway. Guess there were other affected lots of vaccine produced and they traced the last vial to the school. See, one person from another location who had the vaccine died--so it could be the telepathy is fatal. It's hard to say as the man was 81 and suffered a stroke--maybe he would have died without the vaccine? Nevertheless, there's an antidote available, and, for their trouble, the kids will receive a $50,000 payoff from the drug manufacturer when they accept the antidote. 
 Will they choose to take the antidote? Do they even have a choice? I mean, it's a nice hunk of money--and nobody wants to die at age 15...

 About the Book: 
 Ella Harrow is trying to carve out a normal life for herself. Well, as normal as an art geek with psychic abilities can hope for. As museum docent and gift-shop manager, Ella is able to keep her distance from people--and her powers in check--while surrounding herself with the artifacts she loves. But how on earth is she supposed to act normal when a thousand-year-old statue on the museum's terrace suddenly comes to life? 
 Not your ordinary gargoyle, Kees has been asleep for eons, waiting for a portent of evil to wake him from his slumber. Kees isn't a vision; he's a bat-winged guardian created to protect the world from the seven demons of the Dark. Somehow, Ella triggered his reawakening. Maybe the demons have been unleashed? Maybe his heart is finally ready to be chiseled open? The fate of the world isn't carved in stone...yet. 
 My Review: 
 This was a super fun read. Ella is spunky. She's got a terrible amount of power that she strains to contain--particularly after the last time it escaped. Becoming an instant orphan will teach a gal control. One night she's attacked on the terrace of the art museums where she works and the statue beside her erupts into life. It's enough to make a gal swoon. She did. 
 Kees isn't just a delicious art-come-to-life--he's a Guardian, and he knows the world is in big trouble when an untried, untamed magical girl can rouse him from his mystical slumber. Together they learn that the Keepers of Light are being systematically hunted down by the minions of Darkness. WIthout the Guardians Earth has no hope to prevent demonic subjugation. Kees fights against his emotional reactions--claiming to be nothing more than the stone he is--but Ella insists there's more to him than he will accept. 
 Let's just say this: End of times doesn't normal equal romance, but the heat simmered from their first contact--long before they recognized the danger they were in. And, I am NOT a gal who's going to get miffed about some serious friction. Bam-chicka-bow-wow. 
 Kees? D-Lish. Makes me want to hit the Art Institute just to see if I can find me some Guardian... 
 In any case, Ella and Kees do get it right and track down the last Keeper they can find. Unfortunately he's torched soon thereafter by the Big Baddies. And they continue the hunt for both Keepers and Guardian statues--the remaining six which seem to be scattered to the four winds. All while dodging the Dark Ones. Ella's standoff in her childhood home leaves her with far better magical skills, and a few less enemies. 
 It seems, instead of the usual rituals to awaken these magnificent defenders of humanity, a single woman of power can entreat the creature within to break his stony bonds--much like Ella did for Kees--if she is his true mate. And one of Ella's art friends may have found another Guardian. As this is the beginning of a new Gargoyles series, I expect there to be six similar books where a smart sassy gal brings her personal stony savior to life all to save the world. 
 In total I liked the magical elements. I felt that Ella wasn't clueless, but needed training to use the powers she always knew she had. And Kees did train her. Hard. With his teaching, and some books gleaned from essential support characters, Ella built herself from a danger into a weapon for good--and in far less time than Mac Lane. Also, did I mention the sex? Kinda like voting in Chicago it happens early and often... Nice.

 I've posted at some length about parts 1-3 of this serial. Major complaints included implausibility of a gal from Bakersfield starting over in Philly, but that aside this erotic serial continues to escalate the heat. 
 Each new section brings a new level of tension and a bigger, erm, BANG-4-the-buck. 
 To recap, Jessica is a twenty-something girl whose lover, Storm, recently dumped her. She travels from Cali to Pennsylvania to take a job as personal assistant to Dane Ranier. She and Dane had a one night stand prior to her hiring--though Jessica didn't know who he was at the time. Still, the attraction between Dane and Jessica simmers. Soon the are enjoying all the perks of a private office... 
 Oh, and there's some light Dom/sub elements. 
 Things are going fine until...Storm returns. And his actual name is...yeah, well, he and Dane go way back. 
 Jessica's head is all messed up. Desiring both Dane and Storm, she flip flops between them but they decide maybe she shouldn't have to choose. Maybe she should have them both. Sometimes simultaneously... 
 It's a freaky-deaky soiree but in the end Jessica is more suited to one of her Doms. And that leaves us with one sticky goodbye. 
 I struggled with the language which felt stilted in spots. The whole threesome dynamic was a surprise. The erotic heat continued to rise, but I didn't really feel connected with these characters, so the payoff wasn't super high, for me. In the end I enjoyed the book more as a whole, than I had in pieces. It's a quick read.",Thu Jan 23 17:51:18 -0800 2014,Thu Jan 23 18:15:38 -0800 2014,,,0,0

Two years ago she was the beloved only daughter of a Baptist preacher. He was (irrationally) strict however, and when her mother dies of brain cancer Grey won't pay by his rules. She wants to be a filmmaker--and her dad is sure LA is a Den of Iniquity. 
 So she leaves without his blessing and without his financial support. Bereft, and recently scholarship-less, despite her fantastic grades, Grey turns to the only job she can take that will support her academic and living costs--stripping. She's a natural, due to her talent for dance, and excepting her absolute lack of seduction skillz. Grey's never had a boyfriend, and she still possesses her unpunched V-card. 
 One night her club is rented out by Dawson Kellor, a super mega film star, and there is a moment of connection between them. The next day Grey learns that her new internship is to be an assistant to...Dawson Kellor. 
 Afraid her stripper activities will jeopardize her internship, Grey tries to swap projects. But Dawson won't let her go. He's attracted, and can't figure out why Grey doesn't flop at his feet...like pretty much any other woman. Through a few fits and starts, Dawson becomes Grey's sugardaddy--against her wishes. 
 He has this sense that he needs to protect her, and they develop a bond, confessing the horrors of their lives. She soon warms to him. Considerably. There are no euphemisms spared in their sweaty monkeyloving. 
 After this, Grey runs home--Dawson the stealth stalker in tow--and reconnects with her dad. Things are pretty much worked out after that. About 2/3 of the way through the story. There's a later complication when people learn that Grey had been a stripper, but this is handled rather quickly. The final bits of the book wrap up without much strife and with considerable sex--so, if you're into hot scenes for the sake of hot scenes, you are in luck here. 
 I really liked Grey's character. I've know girls like her in my own life--and thought her desire to remain pure was admirable. 
 I kinda felt the relationship with Dawson was rushed. And his stalker-self bordered on creepy, at times. That he could dispatch a potential rapist with no repercussion seemed...extreme. Likewise, I felt the timeframe of the book's end was unrealistic. Movies aren't filmed, edited, released and put on the Academy Awards all within 12 months. So that was kinda off, for me.

John Gilliam is an academic. He is also a homosexual in Victorian England. His father discovers his deviance and John agrees to treatment to cure his unnatural desires. This is commensurate with the time period. (Though still an issue in some locales today!) 
 In his second asylum (the first where he had been brutally attacked and nearly raped by staff) John experiences compassion from one of the attendants, a burly man named Sam Tully. In recognition of his kindness, John seeks to educate Tully--both in reading and numbers. Their acquaintance grows into a friendship and attachment, and more. 
 During his 'treatment' small moments loom large. A gentle brush back of his hair, a reassuring pat on the shoulder, tiny stolen touches that pull John from despair into happiness. And for Tully, who strives to hide his own unnatural predilection, John is all he could hope for. The men become intimate, under the cover of darkness or during Tully's lessons. 
 Unfortunately, the other attendants aren't so moral--or kind. Jenkins, a habitually drunk and derelict attendant, seeks to blackmail both John and Tully for pooftery. Though he has no direct proof of their interactions, an accusation will undoubtedly cost Tully his job and keep John a patient indefinitely. 
 Recognizing that there is something fishy about Jenkins employment, John urges Tully to investigate. Learning the history of indiscretions that have occurred in the asylum, the possibility to get John out safely seems small. Tully and John each have their battles to gain John's freedom. 
 And what then? Can a gentleman and a laborer find happiness with each other? Would the world accept their companionship? 
 I loved this one. A steady build of tension throughout helped develop the clandestine love affair. The subject matter--human experimentation, institutional greed, homosexuality as a mental illness--were handled with due gravity. The love scenes were quiet, but poignant.

 Blaylock has loved Qhuinn, despite his mismatched eyes and outcast status, forever. Qhuinn knows this, but he is unwilling to accept that love--feeling mostly unworthy, but also harboring a desire to conform, in any small way that he can--particularly as his family has always hated him for being imperfect. 
 In previous books this dynamic has been well fleshed out, but in Lover At Last, Qhuinn's story, we see a new vulnerability. His family is dead and he's on his own. A willingness to chase Blay to find a REAL connection now consumes Qhuinn, but that's not so easy for a few reasons. 
 1. Blay's dating Qhuinn's cousin Saxton 
 2. Blay's very hurt that Qhuinn has repeatedly spurned his affection. 
 3. Qhuinn's going to be a daddy--now that he knocked up one of the Chosen. 
 Still, the attraction is fierce. And once Saxton steps aside, Blay allows himself to sample a bit of Qhuinn, never believing that Qhuinn is capable of a real relationship. 
 Boy, was he wrong. 
 And, man, I did love me this book.

 Noah stays with Cooper, just until he can get his own place, but soon they are enjoying each others companionship. Neither man had lasting friendships as a kid, and though Cooper's straight, he's developing an attraction for his friend. 
 Told in alternating first-person POV we get an inside look at Noah and Cooper as they become more than friends. There are many complications, not the least of which Cooper's homophobic family. The sex is molten and the story is poignant. I was particularly moved by the later portion where Cooper is hospitalized and his family block Noah from his bedside. It happens every day in reality--and that really brought the whole bookhome, for me.

 Ethan Walker is gay. He's known this his whole life. He isn't out, but he's not celibate. He's just...quiet. See, Ethan's been subject to a homophobic attack--one he barely survived. His first lover died too young, as well, and Ethan doesn't want his family to suffer. He works for the family business, keeping his head down and his matters private. Currently he has a sexual relationship with co-worker, Blake, though that is on the outs... 
 Beau Bennett is a childhood friend of Ethan's younger brother Zane. Beau has just come to embrace his homosexual nature, though he isn't out. He is openly attracted to Ethan, however, and when Blake quits and Beau is laid off from his shop it's almost natural to expect Beau will come to work for Ethan. 
 Ethan fights the straight-forward Beau, unwilling to attempt a real relationship while closeted, but the attraction is fierce. Learning that Beau is completely naive to most homosexual acts, Ethan's eventually drawn in. They remain cloistered, despite urging from Ethan's family to come out. See, they're totally supportive. And they love Beau longtime. All they want if for Ethan to be happy--something that hasn't happened since his first lover Gavin died ten years ago. 
 Old wrongs are being aired--mainly by hostile homophobes--and the Walker family unites behind Ethan--and Beau. 
 There are so many beautiful moments in this story. I'm rather used to the menage scenes that populate Edwards' work. We've known Beau since his homosexual revelation in Zane. Beau's quiet, unassuming nature makes for a burly Bear. And Ethan's a manbeast himself. So, the two of them make a fantastic couple, one I unashamedly rooted for. The sex is molten. The men are delicious. And the heart of this story is, I think, stronger than the previous Walker novels. Having both men come out to their families--with mixed results--rang true to me.

A former boyfriend was abusive, and she needs to control all aspects of touch in order to avoid the panic attacks.

Cole's privileged childhood was isolating, his father died young, and later Cole learned his father's infidelity left a half-brother--so he's got some daddy issues. And a (medically) demented mother. 
 When these two control-freaks get together, their freak is sooper-deeky. What they do with caramel sauce is illegal in Red States. And, this book opened my eyes to Prince Albert piercing. [Disclaimer: Googling PA will result in eye-opening for you, too. XXX-warning!] 
 But, they get over their insecurities (rather quickly) display an appealing amount of sexual exhibitionism, and tie the knot in no time flat--enraging their respective family members. A little prodding later and all gets forgiven. 
 In short, they are damaged souls who find themselves. And, an HEA. The story is solid. If you like erotic romance you will not be disappointed. REALLY. I wasn't.

 Tate Morrison is going through a nasty divorce. He's never really connected with his wife, Diana, and mainly they hooked up because she was Tate's sister's BFF. He's a bartender, and is used to fielding come on's, but Logan's direct approach is unsettling, int he most curious way. 
 Their continued interactions leads Tate to try what Logan offers--namely some fantastic--albeit gay--sex. 
 There's a period of wooing, and a longer period of experimentation, and throughout these two men (who would likely be considered Alpha in a hetero romance) develop a deeper connection. This isn't just a conquest to Logan, King of the One-Nighter. For long-term lover Tate, it's not just a rebellion. For the first time, they each find a loving relationship they want to work on, one that can be as satisfying for both as it is foreign to Tate. 
 It's obviously fraught with conflict. Tate wants to stay closeted, while keeping Logan exclusive. Logan wants to publicly embrace Tate as his boyfriend, yet doesn't want to help Tate break the news to his uber-Catholic family.

With Aunt Lottie in a coma, Aubree's at loose ends in Suttontowne, LA--especially as she's rather be anywhere but there. She's got a big secret, shared by the hot-hot Booker Outlaw, a secret that could ruin both of them. 
 Booker Outlaw is a quiet man. One of three triplets, and hounded by his family's nasty reputation, he keeps to himself and harbors his love of Aubree in silence. When she was in danger last summer, he didn't hesitate to rescue her--or bury the evidence. 
 This New Adult romance is a bit steamy, and not just because the bayou is sultry. Upon her return, Aubree's guilt of staying away haunts her. And she's plagued by the one man she cannot face--Daniel Langston, one half of a cruel twinship. Daniel wants to know where his brother Damien is--and he's not willing to accept Aubree's stonewalling. 
 The story is told in alternating POV, between Aubree and Booker, which I always love. It's clear from the first that Booker is mad for Aubree--and she him--but they struggle (briefly) to come to terms with this attraction. Booker's so unassuming, he doesn't want to taint Aubree's reputation. Aubree's so driven to leave the bayou and return to her perfectly ordered world, she's afraid to commit to Booker. 
 Still they eventually hit it (none of that Fade-to-Black stuff here, folks)...and forge a relationship from the murky swamp of their dark history. Daniel won't go away, however, and the climax, well, did Suttontowne really need two Langstons? 
 I had a bit of trouble with the mom/aunt issue. Thought that was odd and unnecessary. Also thought the way Aubree handled that revelation was stilted. Loved Booker and his triplet brothers. D-Lish.

 So. To preface this review...I am a scientist. Have been a scientist for 20 years, now. This book is a Christian speculative fic/Sci-fi YA novel. It is written for an audience that reads Christian fiction. It is probably the most anti-science novel I have read, though I do not read much Christian fiction these days. 
 The main character, Thalli, is a genetically-engineered roughly 18 y/o female who is the musician of her clone group. Thalli is an anomaly because she has feelings. The Scientists who oversee the underground facility where this civilization exists have expressly designed the clones to lack emotion. 
 Throughout life Thalli has seen her fellow podmates annihilated for being anomalies. And, still she is unable to hide her emotions, particularly when she plays music. Playing a piece of sacred music written before the nuclear war that destroyed the surface world, Thalli breaks down crying and is collected for annihilation. Just when she is going to die, she is spared by the intervention of her long-time friend, and aspiring Scientist, Berk. See, the big thing is there's not a lot of air and resources underground, so any reason to eliminate a person is, well, lets just say that a major theme in this story is how the Scientists are calculated, emotionless killers with no moral compass. 
 While awaiting her destruction, Thalli is a labrat, subject to the neural experiments of Berk and his colleagues. She meets John, an elderly, natural-born human who is the father of one of the Scientists. John is a devout Christian and shares his love of the Designer (God) with those who are slated for annihilation. He discusses emotions, and love, and prayer and other foreign concepts with Thalli, and eventually with Berk, both of whom begin to accept some level of faith in the Designer. 
 Thalli thinks she is going to go live on the surface, as part of the neural manipulations, but Berk conspires to keep Thalli with him, sure that the surface world is still toxic. They develop an affectionate bond, though Thalli endeavors to nip this, saving Berk from problems with the Scientists. 
 We learn that Thalli has been thoroughly manipulated. She was never out of harms way, and Berk loses his cool. He comes up with some really far-fetched plan to use Thalli and her friend Rhen to enter a computer simulation that would--somehow--result in solving the oxygen problem. 
 This all goes better than expected, and the Scientists are happy, but Thalli, Rhen and Berk are sentenced to annihilation. Then, because there wasn't enough God in the story, we have a Deus ex machina ending. 
 As a novel, the word choice is elementary--key to demonstrating Thalli's innocence and naivete--and it is well-edited. From a critical eye, the storyline is hard to digest and lacks plausibility. But, as a good deal of it is rote Christian dogma, it seems as though it was designed to be accepted on faith. The terminology used throughout supports the Intelligent Design verbiage, with extensive scripture revelation and Designer appellation for God. With the exception of Berk, the Scientists are amoral, lying, manipulative villains. It's rather hard for a compassionate scientist (like myself) to really recommend this book--I feel like we already get enough bad press--but fans of Christian fiction will probably enjoy it.",Fri Dec 27 18:10:15 -0800 2013,Sun Jan 05 19:25:58 -0800 2014,Thu Jan 02 00:00:00 -0800 2014,Fri Dec 27 00:00:00 -0800 2013,0,0

 Ten Tiny Breaths (Ten Tiny Breaths, #1)TEN TINY BREATHS, a New Adult romance by K. A. Tucker is a solid tale of loss, redemption and forgiveness. 
 Kacey Cleary survived the car accident that claimed the lives of her parents, boyfriend and best friend. She overcame bone shattering injuries and fought through the crushing depression in order to be there for the sole remaining member of her immediate family--younger sister Livie. Kacey is plagued by nightmares of the crash--being trapped in the car holding hands with her dead boyfriend as the heat left his skin, hearing the gasping breaths of her mother fade into nothingness. It's been four years since the drunk driver stole her family away, but she can't escape the revulsion she feels when another hand touches hers. 
 Kacey and Livie are on the run from her aunt and uncle--mostly her lecherous uncle who has taken an unnatural interest in fifteen year-old Livie. Relocating to Miami, Livie's outgoing spirit draws the friendship of Storm--a bartender/stripper, and mother of young Mia. Through Storm, Kacey takes up tending bar in the strip club, as is not-so-subtley stalked by their attractive neighbor, Trent. 
 Trent is rather relentless in his pursuit of Kacey--shattering her every boundary against intimacy. It seems that he's going to get her to come to terms with her PTSD, but an abrupt separation nearly destroys their fledgling relationship. In the meantime, Kacey's anger issues are getting harder to hide. 
 Just when a reconciliation seems about to happen, a new curve lands Kacey in the psych ward. And Trent? He's not who he seemed to be...at all. But, the betrayal of Trent is small potatoes in comparison of the plot arc. Through his deception, Kacey and Livie are able to claim their inheritance that they had thought was squandered by Creepy Uncle. And Kacey's aversion to intimacy is overcome--in fact, Kacey finally receives the help she needs to get past her anger and begin living a life of hope. 
 In the end, Kacey learns to forgive the drunk driver who killed her family--and forgive herself for actually surviving. It's a redemption for her, and others, that leads to a HEA we want and in the best way possible.

 NOCTURNES is the third installment of her Hard Rock Harlots series. I adored both STRINGS and BEATS, and couldn't wait to find out what happened to Rax--self proclaimed Guitar God and Dom Deluxe. 
 Back in BEATS Rax was captivated by a stripper, Lola, and in despair of losing her he drank so much he ended up with alcohol poisoning. Rax's battle with the bottle has only increased since then. Especially now that his wingman/lover, Toombs, is exclusive with Jinx, the drummer of their band Killer Buzz Float. 
 As the band records what may be their breakthrough album, Rax pulls away from the happy couples--he's sure he'll never find a true love. Drunk and stumbling through the strip club Nocturnes, Rax spots his Lola--aka Eve Belikov. 
 Eve has danced since she was a child. Her parents, Russian immigrants, were killed by a drunk driver when she was twelve and left her floundering in the foster care system. As a stripper Eve is sexy and untouchable, but as an angel in Heaven, Nocturnes' super exclusive BDSM sub-club, Eve gets touched any way her customers desire. In truth, as a reader I was appalled and disgusted--and had to remind myself that fiction is not even as strange as real-life. Somewhere in this world humans are degraded/exploited far worse than Eve was. Still, it was unsettling. And I think that's the genius of Kendall Grey. She didn't try to make it fun or sexy. She made it real. It was a risk. A big risk, and creatively I think it paid off--at least for me. 
 Eve isn't interested in Rax. He's a drunk mess, and she's committed by contract to have no sexual contacts outsider of Heaven. Still, in Rax she sees her own loneliness, and feels an emotional connection she has lacked since her parents died. Rax, he'll take Lola/Eve in any capacity. Being near her stirs more than his libido--his music is richer and more soulful, kinda like the Night Music of a nocturne. His alcoholism troubles more than Eve; his bandmates stage an unsuccessful intervention. 
 Unable to keep seeing each other, Rax hopes for one last connection, and in the process saves Eve from a brutal attack. Rax blames himself, his drunkenness, for not preventing Eve's disfigurement, and Eve sends him away in her shame, and also for her own peace of mind. Though, their reunion? EPIC seems too small a word. 
 Ms. Grey turns this Leaving Las Vegas-tale into an HEA. Much love, girl. It's a miraculous feat. 
 By turns, NOCTURNES is nasty, dirty, gritty, infuriating, sad, soulful, redeeming and sexy. It takes the filthiest sow's ear of a storyline and fashions a silk purse romance fit for FLOTUS. I highly recommend it, even if you have to read the Heaven scene with only one half-closed squinty eye, like me. NOCTURNES was nothing like I thought it would be, and everything it needed to be. Rax isn't a sap. Eve's hardened and jaded. The two of them have to rub all their rough edges against each other to smooth each other out. And peeling back those layers exposes the soft vulnerability that underlies a true love.",Fri Dec 20 07:07:29 -0800 2013,Thu Oct 13 18:43:13 -0700 2016,,,0,0

The premise sounded interesting, and I'm always down for a New Adult romance, but the story here didn't grab me. ***This review contains some spoilers*** 
 Background: Sydney's a survivor of a car accident that killed three people--her drunk, at-fault boyfriend, and a mother and her young child. Sydney hardly drinks and acts as the DD for her friends now. Oh, and she's still underage for alcohol. 
 While at school, Sydney struggles with the binge drinking she witnesses around her. She seeks to intervene to help kids not over-indulge--with mixed results. Secretly she pines for Evan, her roommate Melanie's boyfriend. 
 It's not so clear that Evan and Melanie are in trouble, romance-wise. And Sydney does nothing overt to damage their relationship. She and Evan are friends. They do some friend-type stuff: hanging out, studying for a mutual class. It is Evan who makes a move on Sydney. And she shuts him down, because Friend Code, and all that. Good girl. I don't want to hate you. 
 The same night Evan puts the move on, Melanie dies from alcohol poisoning. Now Evan is free, but grieving, and Sydney blames herself for not stepping in the path of Melanie's self-destructive alcohol issues. I can buy that. 
 Later that summer Sydney and Evan reunite. They behave as friends though Sydney wants more. And she eventually gets the whole Evan-chilada. The smexytimes are a bit overdone to me. Here's why: throughout this story I felt Sydney read very teen-angsty and immature. She's kinda petty, and jealous, and well, apart from the ""DD-Be-Alcohol-Responsible"" stuff she felt rather juvenile. Some people are adult-y in grade school. Sydney felt kiddie, despite being twenty y/o, thus the graphic sex gave me an awkward vibe. 
 Then school starts again. That this tale was swimming into dark waters wasn't subtle--more fore-bludgeoning than foreshadowing--and we have Melanie's Doppleganger appear on campus. Why is Sydney worried? She's got her man. And the Look-a-like is Melanie's younger sister. Do guys really want to date their dead ex-girfriend's younger sister? I struggled with the logic. But it reinforced my feeling that Sydney is too immature to move forward with an adult relationship. 
 Sydney's BIGGEST problem isn't a boyfriend's potentially-wandering eye, it's how to develop the skills to cope with disappointment--sans alcohol. The very second she catches Evan in a lie what does Sydney do? Pound two cocktails and vomit in the bushes. Yeah. Great job being a mature adult, Syd. 
 The ending consists of a melodramatic twist that does a disservice to the story. A fatality occurs and the plot value of it was nil, IMHO. It felt so unnecessary. What lesson did Sydney learn anyway? Don't drive while consumed by jealousy? Meh. Not big enough to justify the death--and if it was designed to create plot problems for a sequel, well, I don't like the characters nearly enough to hitch along for that ride. 
 I want to recommend the book to younger readers so they can learn how absolutely stupid it is to binge on alcohol--but I can't because the smexytimes are icky-sticky for younger readers. Some New Adult-ers might relate with Sydney, but mostly I shook my head.",Wed Dec 11 03:31:43 -0800 2013,Wed Dec 11 03:32:51 -0800 2013,Wed Dec 04 00:00:00 -0800 2013,,0,0

 Myrna Evans is a sociology professor who specializes in human sensuality/sexual attraction research. Most of her findings involve the use of rock music as an aphrodisiac. While at a conference in my beloved Chi-town, Dr. Myrna comes into contact with a group of musicians--and not any musicians--Sinners, the band she has followed for years. Brian ""Master"" Sinclair's lead guitar riffs have formed many of the test material to which her research subjects have responded. She approaches the band in awe, and soon realizes the object of her interest is, in fact, 3/4 wasted, nursing a busted heart with tequila... 
 The Sinners find sexy-sexologist Myna a hoot and compete for her attention, but it's Brian who gets her room number. Too bad he's too plastered to do more than pass out on her bed. Now worries--he makes up for it the next morning. 
 The chemistry between them is so intense Brian's creative (and other) juices flow unabated. He's half-mating/half-writing, new guitar licks spout forth whenever they get the heat on. And so they fire that burner right on up--for a weekend. 
 Then it's back to 'real life', but the pull between them is strong. Brian's distracted on tour and won't take any of the groupies who throw themselves at his rock-god feet. HE wants more of Myrna--the forever-kind of more. Meanwhile Myrna fears commitment, her ex-husband was controlling and abusive, and is sure that Brian can't give her what she needs--a true love. Plus, she's not willing to give up her career for a man--even if he is Master Sinclair. 
 Reuniting for a holiday, Myrna rides along with the band. Witnessing the groupies' unconventional sexual behavior, Myrna's struck by the research potential. She gets a grant and tours with the band for the summer while conducting interviews of the lusty ladies at each tour stop. It's maddening for her to see so many women after the man she desires, but this demonstrates the level of commitment Brian is willing to set for them; he never glances at the groupies. 
 And when Myrna needs him? He drops everything to get to her. 
 I loved the passion and the intimacy. One thing I can clearly count on with Olivia is a baseline of respect layered with a melody of smoking hot sex. Her characters talk to each other. They get to know one another, on at least a cursory level, before they plunge ahead. Growing up in the Motley Crue ""Girls, GIrls, Girls""-era, I love seeing these tattooed rockers with a heart and a soul--one that is reachable by a strong woman.

She's always cooked, and wants to make it her career, despite her father constantly pushing college. That's not the only force on her life, however. Her boyfriend is pushing her into a more physical relationship, and now her new step-mother is pushing her into a closet of a room to accommodate her nephew, an amputee returning from Afghanistan. 
 Julian is not happy to be ""home"". Since he enlisted in the Marines his aunt, and former guardian, has married and his new step-cousin is...too much. He's mean and nasty; angry at the world and his crap luck. His parents die, and his comrades die, and now this busted up young man feels he has nothing to offer the pretty girl who sees him, always, at his very worst. 
 Julian's gruff demeanor would put anyone off, but, after years of prep work in a professional French restaurant, Cami's used to overbearing men. Not that she's looking for anything. Really, because she isn't. She and Julian do develop quite a friendship, bonding over the pain of losing mothers--his to cancer, hers to abandonment. The boyfriend? Well, he doesn't quite measure up to Julian, even as an amputee. 
 Their relationship does turn physical--after months of get-to-know-you--and it's tender and caring, not a hot sticky mess. Through their love, Julian is able to move past his trauma (mostly) and Cami develops the confidence to take the next step in her professional world--pretty much tell her dad no college. 
 It's a solid love story with well-drawn characters and patient affection. Due to the not-exactly-fade-to-black sex, the book is rated for upper YA readers. I think it's acceptable for anyone who reads YA.

 Through her friendship with Carol, Sia learns the skills she needs to survive on the streets. They sleep under bridges and make the rounds of soup kitchens, aiming to find day work to make a little cash. One morning, a boy from her high school sees Sia in line at the soup kitchen and accuses her of pranking everyone. Scared, Sia flees the shelter and is hit by a car. When she wakes in the hospital, the doctors recognize Sia's condition--dissociative fugue--a rare type of temporary amnesia that has wiped out all of Sia's memories.

In the process she frees herself, and Kai--Kyrillos, son of Hades--who is likewise up for execution. Sophie returns to her Vancouver boarding school to learn her magically-enhanced-bully, Bethany, is poised to claim supreme star-status with the help of Hermes--god of tricksters. 
 Oh, and Sophie has less than two months to regain Persephone's memories and fall in love with Kai, or humanity is doomed. But Sophie can't seem to let go of her fears that Kai will only love her for Persephone's sake, and not her own. And that's kinda not so okay with Sophie. 
 Though Eros and Aphrodite toss in some magic, Sophie can't overcome her own romantic notion that a person should be really in love, not simply faking it. Kai gets it, and he'd like to let her know his own feelings on the matter, but hey, gods have their pride.

 On Halloween Sophie pulls a laxative prank on the vile Bethany, then sneaks out to ruin Bethany's rendezvous with a mysterious boy, Kai. If only high school hijinks were so simple. Sophie does meet Kai, but instead of humiliating Bethany, the kiss Sophie receives triggers an onslaught of memories from her prior life--as Persephone, goddess of Spring and Fertility. Turns out Kai is really Kyrillos, son of Hades, and Persephone's jilted ex. 
 Kai's about to reclaim his long-lost love when Theo--who is really Prometheus--intercedes, dragging Sophie back to the school grounds. 
 Kai enrolls himself in the school--that's the only way he can get near Sophie/Persephone thanks to Theo's magical wards--but Sophie's not really that keen on him. I mean, he's gorgeous but Sophie's concerned that Kai only wants her for Persephone--and she can't even remember that life. Of course, Bethany's on a mission to win Kai for herself, and the spite is quintessential Mean Girl. 
 Yeah, and you thought your high school romances were complicated! 
 Classmate Cassie spouts earth-shattering prophesy only Persephone can avert--by hooking up with Kai--cementing the weird-factor. Oh, and Sophie develops defensive magic of her own, which is great now that Hades and Zeus have sent their lightning and fireball wielding minions to destroy her. 
 Desperate to reclaim her inner Persephone, Theo takes Sophie to the Underworld to find her magical sapphire--a gift from Persephone's mother, Demeter. While there they are framed for poisoning Hades and barely escape. And, upon their return, they learn that Cassie and Bethany have gone missing--vanished by the new guidance counselor. 
 Sophie, Kai, Theo and Hannah brave the labyrinth to rescue Cassie from her dragon captor (oh, and Bethany, too, if it works out, you know) forcing previous foes to become allies. It's a dangerous mission, and may be the end of all things humanity if they fail. 
 Homerun, Tellulah Darling! 
 This YA paranormal romance is a total hoot. The voice: teen-angst-plus-Greek-god-ennui makes for an acidic, deadpan wit that rides roughshod over all those weepy-weepy-poor-me coming-of-age tales. From the first I was struck with laughter. I was totally endeared to Sophie--all she wants is to be loved for her self without, you know, looking like she wants to be loved at all. Because, for a lot of teens, trying to be anything is trying too hard, and hence, so not cool.

All she needs is a great property to kick her business plans into fast-forward. Right now, it's all about her career, and not at all about her love life, which pretty much sucks since she was royally dissed by Nick Hamilton six years ago. 
 Reunited by their mutual friends, Nick Hamilton is finally in finally in position to reclaim the girl he let go--at her father's strong request [read: blackmail]. He may have moved on in body, but never in spirit and Fate seems to have aligned their stars. He owns the VERY property Willow wants to lease.

 See, God's kinda bored with the centuries-long battle for souls. The deal: Seven people must choose God or Evil in a winner-take-all. If the majority end up choosing God, humanity and the universe win, we go on, no more evil... 
 If the other side wins? It's the end...of everything. 
 The players: Jim ""Zacharias"" Heron has come to Caldwell on a mission to reinvent himself. He's a military operative who's grown weary of the assassin life. While blending in, he's befriended by Adrian and Eddie--two Harley riding individuals who sometimes don't throw shadows in sunlight... 
 Jim's path becomes diverted by electrocution--yeah, he dies. Not good form to kill your MC in the first few chapters, but it works here. We get to meet angels and Jim gets his purpose: to save the soul of Vin diPietro--a multimillionaire developer under the control of a powerful demon. 
 This task is made somewhat easier when Vin sets eyes on Marie-Therese, a prostitute with a cause. She's been through the wringer following a brutal divorce and kidnapping of her son. Now that she has Robbie back, her one goal is to pay off the costs of his recovery--being a high-priced hooker has been key to that purpose. 
 Vin is struck by her, but also by the need to protect her. His clairvoyance has revealed Marie-Terese is the target of a dark presence and the cost may be her life. And, she's freakin' hot, so Vin has two reasons to keep close tabs on her. 
 As Jim and Vin both work to save Vin's soul, Vin's girlfriend Devina proves to be a dangerous connection; one that might be the end of this game.

 SELLING SCARLETT, New Adult contemporary romance by Ella James, endeavors to find out! 
 Elizabeth DeVille has two best friends, absentee parents, and a crush on her neighbor, the somewhat older, millionaire, poker-player, Bourbon heir Hunter West. And, one of her best friends--Cross--is in a coma following a motorcycle accident. His parents, his dad's the Governor of California no less, plan to withdraw Cross from the swanky clinic where recovery seems imminent and transfer him to a less-than-desireable county clinic. This, because the good people of Cali wouldn't want to pony up for the medical bill... 
 Hunter, playboy-with-a-secret, has anonymous sex with escorts because, well, it's too dangerous to get close to people. They might find out he's not such a great guy. And, he's got a mommy-complex. But there's something valiant buried within because he's inordinately attracted to helping little Libby DeVille. She's clearly in need of a boost, and rather fetching, in his opinion. Unfortunately he's under the thumb of a vicious porn star who's wielding secrets like Laboutin heels and Hunter doesn't want Libby popping up on her radar. 
 Thus, we get the entanglement: Elizabeth wants to help her buddy Cross, but she's broke. Hunter has plenty of cash, but he's not able to approach Libby with it. Not that he really knows she needs it. Everybody in Napa has a trust fund, right? Wrong. Elizabeth's dad cut off her support years ago when he shacked up with a new wife and her mom's in and out of rehab too much to be of use. She only has one semester of grad school to finish and then she's on her own. Not that she could pay Cross's medical care on an ethics professor's salary, mind you. 
 Elizabeth has a brilliant plan, however: sell the one thing she has--her virginity. (I guess you really can do anything in Vegas.) If the bidding goes well, she might just 'earn' enough to cover the medical bills and her tuition. Oh, and the experience could mesh with her master's thesis on sexual autonomy. 
 While in Vegas, Elizabeth gets a crash-course in seduction from the inmates of the high-class brothel brokering her hymen-auction--which happens to be frequented by one deliciously messed-up, Hunter West. 
 You'd think this tale ends with Hunter buying LIbby's cherry--and perhaps it does--but, in the meantime, we get kidnappings, blackmail, new friendships, BDSM sex acts, and human trafficking, alongside the heartbreaking recovery of Cross. So, SELLING SCARLETT is not a one-trick, erm, pony. 
 This one could have gone totally seedy. At times it borders on melodrama, but the characters are strong and the anguish feels real. There's a sequel, TAMING CROSS, out now--but SELLING SCARLETT is a freebie--for the moment. It's worth nabbing. 
 Couple caveats: It seems as though the distance between Napa and LA can be traversed by car in an hour. Not even a hovercar could mange this feat, so it jarred me. And, I'm not really sure the Gov of Cali needs high priced escorts. I mean, there's all this housestaff just hanging around. No doubt one could dally with a maid.

 And, the sequel BEATS released last week? 
 Lightning damn well struck twice. 
 It is not for the tame, nor timid--though it's not nearly as down-n-dirty as STRINGS. Mostly because Jinx isn't one-tenth the potty-mouth-sex-fiend that Letty was. 
 So, what happens? 
 If you've read STRINGS, you know Killer Buzz Float drummer Jinx Hardwick has it bad for bandmate Toombs Badcock (yes, the name is significant. Lord, the things men can do to embellish their, their...things!) 
 Problem? Toombs comes as a package deal with another member of the band, Rax Wrathbone. Yeah. Toombs is a sub to Rax's Dom. Poor Jinx. But, Rax has an idea. A dastardly plan to let the rather-timid-Catholic-good-girl Jinx have a piece of Toombs--all she has to do is share him with Rax. 
 One night, two men, no inhibitions. 
 Jinx would never agree to such a plan, normally. But she knows her inability to write new songs is linked to her frustration over Toombs. The band is set to record it's first demo for the record label but Jinx's creative block is killing their chance. She won't get paid if she can't contribute, and her large family is counting on some money now that Mom lost her job. With her position in Killer Buzz Float on the line if she doesn't get her beats down, Jinx opts for this one night. It's hot and wet and Jinx nearly steals Rax's lovely sub Toombs away. Nearly. 
 He and Rax have been together for a loooong time. 
 The heartbreak would have Jinx looking back through her rearview if only she had a place to go. Learning Jinx's family is on the brink of bankruptcy Rax offers another exchange. Even more nasty than the first. 
 Jinx will do anything to help her family. Even trade her body out to Rax. Maybe. 
 Good thing, right? Nope. No upsides to this plan. 
 And, yet, it all turns out exactly as we'd want. 
 I'm so glad to say that I loved this sequel. It lives up to the promise of STRINGS yet sets it's own tone, own pace. Jinx is a fantastic POV character. We feel the anguish she lives each day, watching her love find pleasure in others, or hearing how her family is so close to the financial brink and knowing she just can't help. BEATS is more of a deep-tissue erotic massage than it's big sister, STRINGS, but just as captivating.",Sat Sep 07 07:14:26 -0700 2013,Thu Oct 13 18:50:39 -0700 2016,Wed Sep 04 00:00:00 -0700 2013,,1,0

 Truly, there are subtleties to the words. Immortal means to not die, to not be liable to death, whereas, Eternal means forever existing. But if something doesn't die, it's eternal, right? 
 No. If it was created, it can be uncreated. 
 And, it turns out, the pantheon of Greek gods was created. Who knew? 
 So, why am I waxing all philosophical about the shades of difference between immortal and eternal? 
 Simple. 
 Got meself an ARC of ANTIGODDESS, due out September 10th, Book One in the The Goddess War series by Kendare Blake--so I read it. 
 Definitely liked it. 
 What's it about, you wonder? 
 Greek gods living-or I should say dying-in the here and now. 
 I see you over there shaking your head and wagging that pointy appendage. Yes, you, you beady-eyed provincial! Of course, contemporary mythology is an oxymoron. 
 Gimmick, you say? Point well taken, but-gimmick or no-this YA yarn tracking the end of the Titans is a stellar read. 
 This multi-viewpoint adventure tracks sibling gods, Athena and Hermes, as they endeavor to discover what force of the universe is killing them. Athena's choking on owl feathers developing within her body. Hermes is ravaged by a steady fever. Both retain some of their god-like powers-strength, wit, speed--but each are diminished. The key to their survival seems to be held by a teen psychic, Cassie--the reincarnation of Cassandra of Troy--whom they must find. Only Cassandra can foresee how to defeat the enemy gods who wish to finish Athena and Hermes off prematurely. 
 Cassandra wishes she knew why her visions don't extend past her 18th birthday. Will she be alive, or will her powers simply expire? What she does know is she loves Aiden, but their relationship falls into serious jeopardy when she learns his epic past. Is he even human? 
 This book ends with a solid battle and more than one god bites it. I would not call it a happy ending--but it is a satisfactory resolution. Throughout we get an imaginative look at Odysseus, Apollo, Poseidon, Hera, Aphrodite, and the stage is set for Book Two--no question. 
 I loved how each god had his/her own unique mannerisms. Athena-goddess of war and wisdom-is naturally austere, and totally fashion unaffected. Meanwhile Hermes-messenger of the gods and god of thieves-is a creature of comfort and has no qualms stealing the best clothes, food or lodgings on their travels. 
 Though this is YA I really found the sexual tension between Athena and her favored hero, Odysseus, to be interesting. ANTIGODDESS is clean as a whistle and age-appropriate to young teens, so I wonder how this attraction will play out in the coming books. 
 And now I'm wondering how to get me a copy of the next book...

She needs to get home. Her date with her couch and a bottle of red is way overdue. 
 The copiously-inked paramedic who holds the elevator, Caden Grayson, finds the harried red-haired woman in front of him...amusing. Who doesn't like a woman spitting obscenities? 
 And then the power goes out. 
 HEARTS IN DARKNESS, a novella by Laura Kaye, explores the 'chance encounter becoming more' story in elegant alternating viewpoint. 
 Caden, survivor of a wreck that killed his mom and brother, suffers from claustrophobia and the blackness of elevator has him strangled with panic. It's Makenna's hysterical laughter which snaps him back to reality. Over the course of several hours in the dark, Makenna and Caden talk to keep his demons at bay. 
 Fave colors, foods, first times...you know, all the stuff you'd spill to a stranger in a confined space. 
 Through all the confessions, they develop a bond that goes far beyond the physical. When the power returns, Makenna is stunned to discover the pierced, tattooed man who has captured her heart is as gorgeous as she imagined. And, she's surely too plain for him, right? 
 Caden senses Makenna drawing away and can't figure out why. He's determined to keep her close however he can. And the result: passion, baby.

 Since Owen Mitchell. 
 TOUCH ME, episode 4 of the One Night With Sole Regret novella series by Olivia Cunning, follows bassist Owen's sex club fantasy-come-true: finding a woman who might want him for more than his rock persona. 
 Caitlyn just signed her divorce papers and she's out to find a sexy boy-toy to prove that she's still beautiful and to spite her cheating ex. Owen definitely fits the bill. 
 Shibari-practitioner Kelly, rhythm guitarist for Sole Regret and Owen's BFF, plays a huge role in this sexy tale--he ties Owen up for a change! YAHOO! 
 Following a particularly sticky (yet satisfying) interlude, Caitlyn reveals she's really not the sex club type--and Owen agrees. They and Kelly go out to eat and Caitlyn finds Owen's unabashed playfulness as overwhelming as it is endearing. 
 What's the hottest thing about this episode--Owen's self-consciousness. Having grown from an ugly duckling into a desirable man, he still bears the psychological scars from rejection. So, it's all the more delicious when he finds his kindred spirit in geeky Caitlyn. 
 They are phenomenal together, each soothing the other's bruised heart as well as fulfilling each's baser urges. The sexy scenes are not just smoking hot, they are heartwarming. 
 In terms of overall storyline, the pre-quel SHARE ME, which takes place 6 months prior to the Sole Regret series, reveals the backstory of the sexual dynamic between Kelly and Owen. Plenty of menage action in that story (Lindsay/Owen/Kelly plus Linday/Shade/Vanessa). 
 TOUCH ME is monogamous (only). 
 Just when we finally think Owen's going to get his gal, history comes to bite his tail...and though we know he's not likely the responsible party--he takes on that role. 
 Why? 
 Because Owen is THAT guy. The kind who will sacrifice his own needs to make everyone else happy. And that's what makes him totally swoonworthy.

 That's the big question in TIE ME, the fifth installment of the One Night With Sole Regret novella series by Olivia Cunning. 
 Guitarist Kelly Jamison has loved, and lost. So much so he's not sure he can ever love again, even five years after his fiance Sara died. He promised to only love her. To never have sex with another woman. And now every member of Sole Regret has a woman to cherish, except him. 
 Conflicted by guilt and need, Kelly decides it's time to say goodbye to her ghost. Maybe. 
 Visiting Sara's oceanside house hoping the memory of happier times will give him the strength to let her go, Kelly catches the faint notes of a haunting melody on the sea breeze. 
 Dawn O'Reilly is a Grammy-winning pianist who's creatively blocked on her latest project. Isolated by choice, she's overwhelmed by the stranger she finds lurking outside her rented cottage. Of course, the overwhelming part is how attractive she finds him. 
 For the first time in years Kelly is attracted to a woman unlike Sara. Dawn's musical genius turns him on and, without Owen to chaperone, desire overtakes his promises. Even tied up in Kelly's signature Shibari art, Dawn is too much temptation for him to resist. 
 For me, this novella was the definition of bittersweet. The entire time I wished, like Dawn, that Kelly would breakthrough his guilt and grasp the love he so deserved. And when their night ended and his guilt surged? 
 OH! I wanted to hold him just as tight as Dawn had. 
 But no woman can hold Kelly Jamison, right?

 Drew Evans is absolutely the most raw, irrepressible asshat to ever enter The Redemption Tale. Yes, this is a redemption story. No, he doesn't have a ""Come to Jesus"" moment--more like a ""come-to-Kate"" moment. 
 Allow me to explain. No, there's no time. Allow me to sum up: 
 Drew is a gloriously proud, wealthy, womanizing investment banker. He never wants to 'ride the same coaster twice' and that tells you much about our anti-hero. What he does want? Kate Brooks. New hire at his firm. She's beautiful. She's brilliant. She's engaged... 
 Oh, the irony. 
 Poor Drew is attracted to a woman who is unattainable. And to make it worse? She's now competing for his clients. Still, he manages to grow a conscience. Also, he actually does some decent stuff--defending Kate from a lecherous client among those. 
 When Kate is suddenly single, you guessed it: They get tangled, and he finds there's something quite special about being with a woman who stimulates more than his naughty bits. And yet, he can't trust the burgeoning relationship. As soon as there's a wave on the pond he chucks in a cinder block, blowing the whole thing clean out of the water. 
 What happens next? Drew's sledgehammer approach to woo Kate back will either reunite them--or drive her to homicide. And, the ride is absolutely delicious.

 This fast-paced tale follows sassy, nearly-nineteen y/o, Kylie Ryans on her quest for stardom. Rendered homeless when her step-mother kicks her out, Kylie takes the money she'd saved to buy her daddy a headstone and travels from Pride, Oklahoma to Nashville praying she'll be able to survive the two week wait for an open mic. Along the way she lucks into a job and makes a great friend at the club where she's due to sing. Kylie works hard and distinguishes herself-which is admirable-but her talent is there, too. 
 Performing brings out the sass in Little Miss Kylie, and she rocks the house at her open mic, propelling her into alignment with country star Trace Corbin, a bad-boy on his last-chance bar tour. Kylie joins the tour, knowing this is her big break, and knowing that attraction to Trace could end her career before it even begins. 
 On the road, Trace's bad behavior causes big problems, but feisty Kylie won't let his drinking scuttle her chances-even when it means dumping thousands of dollars of liquor down the tour bus sink. Animosity and admiration are subtly woven into a budding romance that brings both heat and heart. 
 Complications ensue-naturally-and yet the narrative never seems forced. Caisey Quinn's deftly woven plot and rich characters will leave you wanting more of Kylie. (And, Trace! Yum!)

 If anything, I'm trying to locate the lovely Ms. Jones's net server so I can hack in for her e-galley of the next book in the series. 
 Why? 
 Because she--somehow--made a gal raised in a christian home fall in love with the son of Satan. 
 That's right. I love her super-Alpha love interest Reyes Alexander Farrow. I may have some competition from Charley, but hey... 
 Here's what happens. Charley is a reaper--actually the only living one in existence. Her humor is Outer Limits--I crack up reading her deadpan observations--which takes a bit of the ""grimness"" out of her reaper duties: being a portal through which the dead cross into the afterlife. When they pass through her, she absorbs some of their memories. Communicating with the dead is handy for Charley's private investigator work. Especially when she helps her uncle solve crimes in his job as a Detective for the Albuquerque PD. 
 In this book, Charley's longstanding attraction to Reyes Farrow is tested to the limit. See, Reyes has moved into her building--right next door. And he keeps leaving her these sexy Post-its telling her to come over. Charley would like to--but she's nervous. First, as the son of Satan Reyes may be able to lead Lucifer's army straight into Heaven by breaching Charley's portal. Also, Charley suspects Reyes is behind a string of arsons that inexplicably have destroyed every dwelling Reyes ever shared with his sexually abusive step-father. Places where photographic evidence of Reyes' molestation had been hidden in the walls... 
 At her core, Charley is an honest soul. She won't hesitate to turn Reyes in if he's a criminal. As she isn't sure, she continues to search for evidence. In the meantime she and Reyes share some heated (read: smoking hot) encounters. Because--did I mention he makes me swoon?--he's delicious. Intelligent, strong, virile, compassionate and head-over-heels for Charley without losing his magnetic charisma. 
 In the midst of her Reyes-confusion, Charley works on solving a newly-discovered serial killer case. She follows a few dead leads, and aids nearly thirty lost souls to find their eternal rest. Her discovery of the arsonist seemed more obvious (to me) but handily removes the tension betwixt herself and Reyes. It seems Charley's life will move to the next level with Reyes into Happily Ever Land--until she's kidnapped by a maniac. 
 The book ends with an arrangement I hope Charley will not refuse--even if it means the end of civilization as we know it.

 CURSE YOU PUBLISHING PROCESS THAT TAKES FOREVER TO PUT A BOOK ON THE SHELF! 
 Cannot get enough of the tension between Charley--the Grim Reaper--and her on/off love, Reyes, the son of Satan. Who knew that I'd find heartbreak for a devil spawn? 
 Darynda Jones you are a miracle maker. Please continue. 
 What happens in book four? Charley deals with PTSD after nearly dying in book three. But, you note, she nearly died in all the previous books, so why was this one different? Because in Book 3 the one who nearly killed her was Reyes sadistic foster father--the one Reyes went to jail for killing--who, guess what? wasn't yet dead! 
 Oh, the trauma/drama! 
 In book four Reyes is free, and we expect Charley and he to finally hit it for reals--not in a dreamscape. Do they? Well, yes, but they take a damn long time to get around to it. Yet, it's exactly the right time when it happens. 
 And now, I'm one-part ecstatic knowing that things are going well in Albuquerque, and the other part is frustrated. 
 Because it's another month until Book 5 will be shipped to my mailbox! AGONY!!!",Sun Jun 09 03:54:36 -0700 2013,Sun Jun 09 04:08:44 -0700 2013,Fri Jun 07 00:00:00 -0700 2013,,0,0

 FIRST GRAVE ON THE RIGHT by Darynda Jones is a gem! 
 Charley Davidson is a Reaper. She doesn't actually harvest souls--she's merely a portal--a conduit to the otherside. A Pearly Gate, if you will. 
 And, she's been this way her whole life. Even brought her own mother's soul to eternal rest when she died at Charley's birth. 
 So, it's no surprise when dead lawyers show up unwilling to ride the express to Eternity. What is shocking? The three of them are partners--and they had a really nasty client. 
 Can anyone say m-o-b h-i-t? 
 Being the gate to the afterlife doesn't pay bills. Charley works as a PI, and also helps her uncle, a police detective, solve crimes for the Albuquerque PD. Why not? I mean, lots of murder victims could tell her exactly where to find the body and who the perp was. 
 Anywho...Charley's seen it all. Except perhaps for the dream lover who continues to sex-her-up when her eyes close. He's the absolute sex bomb. And, for good reason: Reyes Farrow is the son of Satan. Yeah. 
 Uber-hot! 
 Oh! I see you staring down your nose at me! Who's to say he's pure evil? And, and, even if he is, lots of girls go for the Bad Guy, amiright? 
 Besides, he's just a dream lover...which means they do the dirty dance in her head. No need for confession, folks. 
 Charley endeavors to solve the mystery of the Three Dead Lawyers whilst dodging a pint-sized poltergeist and commiserating with her BFF/secretary Cookie and lamenting her shitty coffee maker. It's a rollicking time--and Charley manages to get herself beat up (twice?) and nearly shot by a client's abusive husband. In this she would have died but a cloaked visage appears and slices her attacker down with mystical efficiency. 
 Here's the thing: this book is Laugh. Out. Loud. Charley is irreverent. She's so dead pan (pun intended) about her interactions with the departed that it stuns the reader into hilarity. In the end she does help the lawyers to crossover and finds out a bit more about the connection between Dreamy Reyes and the cloaked assassin. Oh, and it's hawt.

Not only is she starving emotionally--as her mother works overtime and her brother disappears back to college--she starves physically, ravaged by grief and the pain of losing her closest confidant. She decides that God doesn't listen, and now she doesn't want to listen in church, either. This mean giving up on the 'good-girl' rules of her quiet rural town. Bad Ash, as newcomer Colt discovers, seems ready to do just about anything to hold her grief at bay. As the rush of rebelling ebbs, Ashley learns that grief is better shared and finds a safe space with a pure love. 
 Review: This story is an accurate representation of the emotional trauma a deep loss brings. Confusion reigns for Ashley, and her risky behavior is an organic manifestation of frustration, anger and guilt experienced by many teens. There is some heat, as Ashley attempts to use sex to mute her pain, but it's rawness is not revealing. 
 There's not a lot of whitewashing, here. Ashley's pain feels real and her introspection is honest. Ashley questioning her faith following her father's death risked being preachy, but Moore handled these dark waters with finesse. There are many lessons to learn from Ashley, but they don't amount to: ""how not to live."" In truth, Ashley's 'letting go' is more about releasing her negative emotional baggage and living her life, as her father had wished she would. 
 I would recommend this story to anyone, and look forward to more excellent work by Leigh Talbert Moore.",Tue May 21 03:38:45 -0700 2013,Tue May 21 08:04:55 -0700 2013,Mon May 20 00:00:00 -0700 2013,,1,0

Zip isn't much into boys--because, in her small town, she's known them all since preschool and they've always been 'friends'. At the opening, two new kids have arrived; brother and sister Kieran and Kayla Lanier. Kieran isn't just new, he's someone very different from anyone Zip has known--which she learn in first period English when she bores him to death...or he passes out. [Spoiler: he lived but he had to carried to the nurse.] 
 This auspicious beginning sets into motion big reveals by Kieran and the Lanier family--all intensely private people. And the bombshells--even for Kieran, who has suffered a variant of narcolepsy since childhood--are well-developed and plot-driven. As the root cause of Kieran's condition becomes known it is Zip to whom he clings, and she's not too sad over it. Especially when it mean s a boyfriend and date for the prom. 
 But the darkness in Kieran's past reaches out from unexpected places, coming through both his and Zip's dreams and straining their budding relationship. They don't know who to trust, and won't risk losing each other, resulting in an exciting climax. Zip fights to help Kieran, but neither of them have the ability to solve this problem alone. Good thing they don't have to. 
 Critique: 
 This is a well-paced novel with some suspense and elegantly-placed red herrings. The romance reads true and is compelling, and the science behind Kieran's malady is well-conceived. Zip and Kieran are a fun couple, and I can't recall the number of times I laughed when poor Kieran passed out at just the wrong moment--but there were many. 
 I would recommend IN YOUR DREAMS to any person who enjoys YA romance...and anyone who enjoys a good YA story. Looking forward to the sequel.",Fri May 17 08:36:22 -0700 2013,Sun May 26 13:48:18 -0700 2013,Sat May 25 00:00:00 -0700 2013,,1,0

 Tris Prior is messed up--her parents are dead and she just killed one of her best friends in order to survive the massacre in Abnegation. 
 Now she must survive at all costs...why? What meaning does her life hold? 
 Honestly she'd rather be dead, and I can almost empathize. 
 Yes, she has Four/Tobias but he is often distant. Dauntless has fragmented into independent and Erudite-bound factions and she doesn't know who to trust. 
 First Amity turns them out, then Candor. Erudite hunts them, and Abnegation is a shadow-faction following the massacre. The loyal Dauntless develop new leadership and seek an alliance with the factionless in a bizarre twist that ultimately makes complete sense. In order to spare her comrade--who are still under Erudite remote-control, Tris turns herself in to be the guinea pig for all Divergent. Subjected to repeated testing it becomes clear that Tris' mind won't break though her body reaches its limit. 
 Still, Tris doesn't think the objective of taking down Erudite for the sheer necessity is exactly the right way to go. And she allies herself with Marcus against Tobias in the final battle. 
 When the chips fall, it is Tris' bravery that might save Dauntless from its own captivity, but then again, I guess we need the third volume to answer that question.",Fri May 17 05:48:35 -0700 2013,Thu Aug 01 16:16:49 -0700 2013,Mon Jul 29 00:00:00 -0700 2013,,0,0

 Plot premise: In the near future the use of radiation blocking medicine alters the genetics of humanity resulting in mutations that creates superbeings. Some of these mutations are kinda lame. Who really wants blue skin? The ability to mimic the scent of a skunk, anyone? Going once, twice... 
 Fiona O'Connell, however, had the (mis) fortune to be born invisible--to a crime kingpin father who figures she's just perfect--as an assassin. With his Charm power, Jonas O'Connell can woo any female to do his bidding, and he's decided that Fi, at 16, should become a cold-blooded killer. So, Fiona goes on the run with her telekinetic mother--trying to escape her first deadly assignment. Thing is, when you're brought up around criminals, it's REALLY hard to trust anyone. 
 And, Fiona doesn't. 
 Not the kids at the new school who are attempting to befriend her, and especially not her eldest brother, her father's right-hand man and a confirmed killer. In order to survive, she must learn to confide in the super kids she meets, however, and she must also trust that this time her mom won't go crawling back to good old dad. 
 The best part of this story, has to be Fiona's sense of humor. She's wry and witty and, due to no one knowing her facial expressions, used to being candid. Of course, author Natalie Whipple stands the invisibility barrier on its head to bring in the romance--which works well. Poor Fi! And, yet the lesson of facing one's fears head-on is subtle and sweet. 
 I'd definitely recommend this to upper middle grade and YA readers. It's a great story with fun twists and while it resolves nicely, it's got built-in sequel potential.",Fri May 17 05:41:21 -0700 2013,Tue Jun 04 17:47:33 -0700 2013,Sat Jun 01 00:00:00 -0700 2013,,0,0

 What can I say about Simone Elkeles? She is a master of the dual viewpoint. Ever since I read LEAVING PARADISE I knew her books would fill my TBR shelves. And yes, I've read every single title she's published. 
 Because, as I have previously mentioned, I'm a sucker for series books. 
 I had the great pleasure to meet Simone at ALA last week and only needed to find a free day to inhale my advanced reader copy of her latest YA offering. 
 WILD CARDS begins a new series for Elkeles, one that centers on a high school football team struggling to reach the 'next level' and is sure to delight her legion of fans. As with the PERFECT CHEMISTRY series, the love story here is gritty and complicated, yet compelling enough to make the pages fly by. 
 Derek 'The Fitz' Fitzpatrick is a phenom quarterback with Division I scholarships whose military father is in a nuclear sub on the bottom of the ocean. His mother died of cancer two years prior--alone, because Derek didn't leave practice to be at her side when she breathed her last; his guilt drove him to quit football forever. He's just been expelled from prep school in California and his pregnant stepmother is moving him to suburban Chicago so she can be closer to her estranged family while Derek's dad is deployed. 
 Arriving in Fremont, Derek meets Ashtyn, his stepmother's younger sister--she's a senior in high school, too. Oh, and captain of the Fremont football team. 
 You read that right. Ashtyn's been the kicker on Varsity since her freshman year and just got voted captain--ahead of her star-quarterback boyfriend, Landon. 
 Derek and Ashtyn have both suffered abandonment, and neither is eager to experience it again. Derek's 'love-'em-and-leave-em' attitude doesn't mesh with Ashtyn's need to be loved, so immediately they are at odds despite an overwhelming attraction. The stakes raise when Landon leaves both Ashtyn and Fremont High to transfer to their rival school, crushing Ashtyn's dreams of a state championship. 
 Determined to carry the team forward, Ashtyn begs Derek to drive her to Texas for the Elite football camp she has been invited to attend. He reluctantly agrees, mostly because he can't imagine keeping his hands off of her on the trip--and he knows he'll only end up breaking her heart like everyone else in her life. 
 Excerpt from the book: ""I wake up with a hard-on. And my arm around Ashtyn. We're spooning like and old married couple and her long hair is in my face. The flowery smell of her perfume reminds me that while Ashtyn talks tough and is a football player, she's one hundred percent female. I did my best to stay on my side of the bed, but she kept moving closer. And closer. Then she told me she was cold and asked me to hold her, so I did. 
 That was my first mistake. 
 I quickly take my arm off her and manage to get some space between us. I need to cool off. She was half-asleep when she asked me to hold her, so hopefully she won't remember. I'm not about to play her temporary boyfriend until we get to Texas."" 
 SWOON! Seriously. 
 While at the football camp, Landon makes Ashtyn's life hell--and her discovery that Derek is a renown quarterback turns her world upside down. Ashtyn will do anything to get Derek onto Fremont's team--even if it means trusting him with her heart. 
 As with PERFECT CHEMISTRY there is some heat to this YA romance. It doesn't get all smexy, but it doesn't exactly fade-to-black; it's recommended for readers at the 9th grade and above. Personally, I loved it and look forward to the next Fremont title--because now I NEED to know how the team fares in the season. 
 WILD CARDS is due for release in late September/early October--just in time for the high school football playoffs, I guess. You can pre-order it now.",Fri Apr 19 17:21:37 -0700 2013,Tue Jul 09 05:42:17 -0700 2013,Sat Jul 06 00:00:00 -0700 2013,,0,0

 In Kira's world, all the drugs and chemicals that leeched into the water systems caused changes in neural development allowing for pubertal-onset telepathy. Years ago the first telepaths, called Readers, were ostracized, but now it's so commonplace that big cities have been largely abandoned and houses must sit at a minimum distance so the neighbors can't overhear what's happening next door. At sixteen, Kira's passed the point where she would transition into a Reader. Considered a Zero, she's in the minority and destined for the menial tasks assigned to those with closed minds. Not the future she envisioned. And it troubles her would-be boyfriend Raf, as well. 
 But Kira soon learns that she isn't a Zero after all. While her mind isn't open, she has a different ability--the ability to ""jack"" into others' minds and cause them to obey her commands. One can imagine the incredible potential of her power. In fact, one does, and he's a gangster. 
 See, there are a fair amount of Jackers out there--hidden in plain sight--and they are being rounded up by two contingents: the Mafia, and the Government. While trying to save Raf from certain death, Kira blows her Jacker cover and is rounded up into an internment camp where government scientists study the ""jacker problem"". Much like the internment camps of World War II, Kira and her fellow refugees have no rights, no help, and no recourse against the potentially fatal 'treatments' they endure. 
 In order to survive, Kira must team with adversaries who would just as soon kill her. Good thing she's a Super-Jacker, and her skills may be strong enough to free them all. But, even if she does escape where can she go? Her family will undoubtedly become targets. And, the agents running the camp will surely track her down. The resolution is a pell-mell race for Kira to save not only herself, but young Jackers in the government testing labs. 
 Kira is a strong MC, and her steadfast commitment to doing the right thing, even if it's hard, gives readers a protag worthy of respect. It's a super-fast read that tackles real societal problems with grace and confidence. I read this book in a day. Mostly because I couldn't stop until I knew Kira was safe.",Fri Apr 19 17:06:29 -0700 2013,Thu Mar 27 18:28:49 -0700 2014,Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 -0800 2012,,1,0

 Plus, longtime pal Paige is sincerely encroaching on the Isaac Territory. 
 Madison seems at the end of all things sane when she finally realizes things AREN'T sane. There is no way Kaylee could be so out-of-her-mind that she's trapped in the psych ward. 
 Thing is...Madison knows all of this is wrong. And it's Isaac who clues her in. 
 Kaylee's been cursed. 
 By witches. 
 See, Isaac knows this because, well, he knows a WHOLE LOT 'O WITCHY STUFF! 
 And, perhaps Madison does, too. If she really digs deep Madison might just find out that she's a force to be reckoned with. It's a power she needs to embrace. 
 Good thing for Kaylee, she does. 
 EMBRACE, a YA paranormal romance, really hits all the notes. Lost loves, New Loves, BFF's, Teen Angst, and that soul searching feeling that all teens face. Madison takes each step with caution and this makes her a heroine in my eyes because she uses reason and intellect to solve her problems.",Wed Jun 06 08:44:58 -0700 2012,Mon Aug 12 19:49:37 -0700 2013,Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 -0800 2012,,0,0

I didn't see any of the spark that animates Green's other work. Aza has exactly one personality trait, her anxiety, and none of the other characters manage to have even a single dimension. The plot is just as anemic as the characterizations. Almost nothing happens in this book, which might be fine if it had multi-dimensional characters and/or good prose, but it doesn't. 
 In the past I have found Green a deft writer of both drama and comedy. Here, I was never entertained, amused, or moved at any point. I was only bored or mildly annoyed. This isn't bad in a loud, obnoxious way. There is nothing bold or creative or ambitious in its failure. This book is beige wallpaper. It is watery, lukewarm tea. It is inert and unmemorable. 
 It doesn't please me to be so harsh in my assessment of this work. I enjoy John Green not just as an author, but as a public figure. I root for his continued success. I wanted very much to love it but I found it a colorless misfire.

It's certainly a page turner. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the development of Emma's relationships with both Jesse and Sam, and I found how Jenkins Reid wrote Emma's dilemma about which man to be with (which was also a dilemma about which version of herself she wanted to be long term) compelling. Love triangles are really hard to write in a non-obnoxious way. I have a low tolerance for them as a rule but I thought Reid did a good job making the audience understand why Emma wavered between the two men, and none of the characters act with malice towards each other. The period of wavering also doesn't go on for too long without resolution. 
 Part of me wants to give this five stars because I did felt such a high level of emotional engagement.

There's a good amount of historical information seamlessly integrated into the story and Chamberlain does a great job establishing the local culture and mores of Little Italy, Baltimore and Hickory, North Carolina. 
 There are some twists and turns and mysteries that are resolved in a very satisfying way. Twists can fail in two very different ways. They can be so random and poorly foreshadowed that they seem contrived or super conventional and predictable and thus not very twisty.

I was entertained enough to keep turning the pages but this didn't feel particularly fresh or creative and the characterizations were superficial. This is the novel equivalent of a TV movie that keeps you watching, but won't stick in your memory for any period of time. 
 I was intrigued by a premise that so directly references the well known ""final girl"" trope because I see a fair number of horror movies. The crime that made Quincy a ""final girl"" is a very boilerplate horror movie type of crime. A slasher attacks a bunch of horny teens holed up in a cabin in the woods. Flashbacks to this crime, which Quincy doesn't remember, are intercut with present day scenes of her interacting with prickly final girl Sam (view spoiler)[ who is not actually Sam but rather a former psychiatric patient named Tina who has stolen dead Sam's identity (hide spoiler)] and dealing with the death of first final girl Lisa and her superficially fine but actually underwhelming relationship with her quasi-fiance Jeff.

I found enough details of Quincy's life and background, as well as the other two final girls, to keep reading even though this book adopts many cliches of the horror genre without altering or subverting them (while this book lifts plot points/characterizations from horror movies, I wouldn't consider it a horror novel at all).

This is tragic and funny and sweet and disturbing and moving and I am just a puddle of feelings. Eleanor is a truly magical character. Her distinctive perspective, her smartly written internal monologue, is a joy to read. There are so many clever turns of phrase and observations in this book. Eleanor is socially isolated and socially awkward, due to some pretty horrific past trauma that is revealed gradually over the course of the book. 
 At the start of the novel she seems content with a deeply solitary life defined by ritual and brisk, efficient self sufficiency. She performs her nondescript office job well, she has set pre- and post-work routines that get her through her days. She knows precisely what to eat and what to read and what to listen to and what to watch and what bus routes to take and where to shop and what crossword puzzles to do. She is highly intelligent. Yet she is alone. 
 This is no way to briefly describe Eleanor's emotional journey over the course of this book in a way that really does it justice. A short plot synopsis makes this sound like a cheesy Hallmark movie when it is so much more. It is perfectly accurate to say this is about Eleanor getting in touch with emotions that she could not let herself feel until the age of thirty. This is about a woman discovering who she is and what she wants and needs and deserves. It is about a lonely woman reaching out and finding desperately needed friendship and love from unexpected sources. Reading these last few lines, I know my summation sounds corny, but this is so well written. This book is never maudlin or contrived. It is not manipulative. It is beautiful mix of humor and heartache. Eleanor is a character whose unique experiences and personal idiosyncrasies will stay with me for a long time.

This is a book about people who desire to have meaningful sexual and platonic connections with others, and their bumbling attempts to gain and maintain these connections. While this book has comedic elements, I do think the blurbs are overselling the humor. There are scenes and lines that are amusing, but it's not really laugh out loud funny. 
 Eve becomes obsessed with MILF porn after receiving an errant dirty text, and all her social encounters take on this erotic charge as she becomes more immersed in the world of online porn to combat her loneliness as a divorced woman who has just sent her only child to college. She develops an intense, complicated friendship with one of her employees, Amanda. She signs up for a gender studies course and builds relationships with her professor and several of her classmates, who form a strong roster of supporting characters even if the level of intimacy between the students and the professor was far fetched. 
 Brendan's chapters were a total drag though. He's a boring, basic, super douche bro. I don't have any criticisms in terms of the authenticity of Perrotta's portrayal, and I don't think Perrotta wants the audience to like Brendan. I think he does accurately capture the voice of a certain type of teenage boy. He's just not the type of character I care to read about.

I didn't time myself with a stopwatch or anything but I know it took less than two hours to read cover to cover. So the time investment this slim volume requires is minimal. Given that this book demanded so little of me, I guess I can say it was well written enough to justify the short amount of time I spent reading, but it was so fragmented and slight it was frustrating as well. 
 This reads like an essay collection or a diary. It's a random grab bag of the protagonist Thandi's musings about her life. It's so episodic it feels like a stretch to even call it a novel. The narrative spine holding everything together is supposed to be Thandi's grief over the death of her mother, but even that defining tragedy isn't enough to make this feel cohesive. The chapters are all very short. Some ""chapters"" are merely a sentence or a paragraph, others ambitiously span two to (occasionally) three whole pages. Many of these vignettes are intimate, surveying Thandi's innermost feelings about her family, her love life, and her feelings of dislocation as she tries to understand her identity as a wealthy, light skinned black woman who is a the daughter of a South African mother. If we take each of these tiny chapters as an independent work, some of them are impressive in how much emotion they manage to convey so quickly. Others are random and disconnected from Thandi's immediate experiences and feel like things college freshmen say to each other at 3 am to show off how deep they are. The way Clemmons writes about South Africa was hit or miss for me. Thandi's personal observations about South Africa, as someone who warily visits but never really feels at home there, are interesting but the ""let's talk about Oscar Pistorius and Winnie Mandela and Kevin Carter randomly for a few pages"" inserts are just odd and jarring. 
 This is a three star read as is because it reads more like an outline or a rough draft of a potentially excellent book yet to be written rather than a finished work in and of itself. Thandi is just interesting enough, and Clemmons's writing is good enough to be worth the minor time investment this book requires, but I also kept thinking this could have been so much more than it was.",Fri Aug 11 08:12:00 -0700 2017,Fri Aug 11 11:11:35 -0700 2017,Fri Aug 11 11:11:35 -0700 2017,Fri Aug 11 00:00:00 -0700 2017,0,0

You're never going to say, ""yawn, not another story about a woman who has to move in with her impoverished, elderly father and his sex dolls after she flees her marriage to a maniacal tech billionaire who wants to literally mind meld with her after years of monitoring and controlling her every movement within his space age compound. How cliched, another book where a subplot revolves the bumblings of a con artist who has to quit his lucrative work seducing and then stealing from women when he develops an insatiable sexual attraction to dolphins that makes him unable to perform sexually around human women."" 
 This gets major creativity and cleverness points from me for its cracked out craziness. Nutting is very imaginative and twisted in a way that certainly makes for a page turning read. The futuristic tech in this novel (which is set in 2018-2019), created by Byron as the head of Gogol, feels realistic enough to be unnerving. I was also impressed by how this book managed to be quite humorous and quite dark at the same time. As wacky as this book is, Nutting is not just trading on novelty and shock value. As good science fiction tends to, this book has smart things to say about our world. 
 The dialogue is very stylized and artificial. It's snappy and fun and impressively crafted, but it doesn't resemble the way humans actually talk to each other. For the most part I was totally fine with this because truly ""realistic"" conversations are usually not interesting or articulate enough to be enshrined in print to be read for entertainment purposes but occasionally I was pulled out of the story by the artifice of the character's interactions with each other, or by a descriptive aside I thought was trying a bit too hard.

Our protagonist ""Irene"" is in California working at a low rent gossip rag under an assumed name after her boss is murdered due to her possession of a rare and valuable notebook. As Irene is now in possession of this notebook, her own life is very much in danger. In her new home she is drawn into a new mystery, a drowned minor starlet who had been entangled with powerful star Nick Treymayne. Other women start turning up dead the same way, ""accidentally"" drowned. Irene is assisted in her investigation by the owner of the Burning Cove hotel, Oliver Ward, a former magician who was badly injured during a trick gone wrong. As tends to happen in these sorts of books, romance blooms as they try to crack this case together. 
 The suspense here doesn't really revolve around who is committing the crimes. In one of mysteries the perps are known from the outset, and in the other we do have some cool last minute twists but the search for the identity of the killer is not the most important part the narrative. So instead of a whodunit it's more of a how and whydunit. I was very pleased with how this was plotted. Quick hits that sweet spot in terms of the two mysteries. They are neither too simple nor too convoluted. Irene is a fine lead and Oliver had a really cool back story that was fun to read about in its own right. Their relationship is sweet and drama free, a nice subplot which doesn't feel contrived and doesn't overwhelm the mystery plot(s). There's a continual undercurrent of danger as Irene is being menaced not only by the murderers who want the notebook, but from studio system muscle committed to preserving Nick's reputation at all costs. 
 My only beef was that I didn't get a strong enough sense of the historical time period. I wanted to read this book in the first place because of it's Depression era Hollywood setting. There's little that happens here that feels specific to that time period, and you don't get that much historical information about the 1930's movie industry. 90% of what transpires could have occurred in 2017. So I enjoyed this a lot but for a work of historical fiction you don't get that feeling of being transported into another time which was a bit disappointing.",Tue Jul 18 20:53:06 -0700 2017,Wed Jul 19 10:43:08 -0700 2017,Wed Jul 19 10:43:08 -0700 2017,Tue Jul 18 20:53:06 -0700 2017,0,0

El Akkad has crafted a devastating survey of the horror of war that feels timeless and true and disturbingly plausible. Even though this is set in the future, starting in 2075 and stretching into the 22nd century, the audience doesn't get the benefit of seeing any of the events as part of a remote, alien future. 
 El Akkad chronicles the destructive power of war at the macro level and the micro level. The Second American Civil War has wrought havoc at a regional, national, and global level. Mass casualties result from drone warfare, guerrilla battles, terrorist attacks and plague. Those who survive are frequently impoverished and physically and psychically damaged. We learn about the carnage through World War Z esque historical document inserts sprinkled throughout the text. 
 Refugee camps dot the blighted landscape. The Chestnut family spend six years in one such camp. El Akkad includes enough smartly written and haunting information about the large scale destruction of the Second Civil War (I will get chills every time I hear ""South Carolina"" for the forseeable future), but he is also interested in chronicling with searing power the dissolution of a family and an individual as they are subjected to the vicissitudes of the conflict. Our protagonist is Sarat, who is thrust into the eye of the war when her father is murdered and she is forced into a refugee camp with her mother and two siblings. She suffers unimaginable horrors over the twenty year course of the war. (view spoiler)[ Her mother is murdered when the camp is ambushed, her brother suffers brain damage, her sister is killed by a drone, and she is subject to seven years of imprisonment based on faulty intelligence. She is finally released when the war ends and stays with her brother, sister in law and nephew but she has been so scarred by what she has experienced she decides to destroy most of the country by smuggling a deadly plague up North to be released during a war ending ""reconciliation ceremony"" (hide spoiler)] 
 This is expertly plotted and the prose is excellent. Individual lines leap off the page, shining with truth and power. I was totally blown away by how thoroughly I bought into El Akkad's vision, how deeply I mourned for these characters and their circumstances. The level of moral ambiguity and complexity in the story and the characterizations impressed me. Moral/ideological/political causes of the war are barely discussed because the act of war itself has stripped the principles away from north and south alike, so only simmering tribal hatred remains.

As the title suggests, four of the five main characters are bastard offspring of royalty who are on the run from murderous mercenaries and from a war their traitorous relatives are trying to start. The characters are tropes straight out of central casting but I liked their rapport and their back stories enough not to mind they weren't original. You have Jax the stable boy, Miles the stuffy book worm, Zell the taciturn warrior whose hard outer shell masks his nobility and kindness, Lyriana the crunchy, touchy feely, do gooder type, and Tilla your narrator who is struggling with insecurities borne of her lowly station. They are different enough from each other that there are opportunities for friction, but they also have the common experience of being outcasts and their shared trials to bond them together. 
 This book is quite dark. There is a lot of gore and violence, and there's plenty of pain in the character's past and present. This dark material is written powerfully and sensitively, and intercut with some understated humor that works without seeming out of place. 
 Also, I can't believe I'm typing this, but the obligatory sort of love triangle, which typically drives me bonkers in stories like this, is actually compelling. It doesn't dominate the story thankfully but what's there is good. Tilla is hot for Zell because he's brooding and tortured and hot. He reciprocates those feelings but he has very understandable intimacy issues. Miles has pined for Tilla his whole life but she's just not into him. Each character behaves in an interesting, plausible way, it ties nicely into the resolution of the plot, and Shvartz really nails the dark side of male entitlement. 
 This book isn't seeking to reinvent the wheel but Shvartz writes well enough that he can make even shop worn conventions of the genre feel interesting.

 Evelyn Hugo is a magnificent character. Reid makes her totally authentic while also successfully communicating how this woman thrived in Hollywood for decades as a beloved, coveted megastar. The complexity of the characterization is impressive. Evelyn is such a fascinating woman, who has lead such a complicated life, and Reid has her narrate her life story with great self awareness and perceptiveness. After an introduction, the book is broken into seven parts, each named after one of Evelyn's husbands. All seven men are distinct, well developed characters who have fascinating relationships with Evelyn. Writing one compelling literary marriage is impressive, Reid writes seven with great skill. I always had a great understanding of what Evelyn saw in each of her doomed marriages, what the men saw in her, and how their marriage worked. Some of the marriages are purely transactional, others are based differing combinations of sexual attraction, platonic love, convenience, and status seeking. The level of nuance was so impressive I really felt like I lived beside these characters. One of the things this book does so well is explore how these characters conceive of what love means. 
 I have been learning a lot about Old Hollywood these last several months as I have been listening to Karina Longworth's ""You Must Remember This"" podcast. My husband is also incredibly knowledgeable about film history and film making, and I can't help but pick up some of his knowledge, so I feel confident in saying that I know enough to praise Reid for how accurate her portrayal of Hollywood is. As crazy and soap operatic as Evelyn's life was, with all the dizzying highs and crushing lows, she nails Evelyn's career trajectory so perfectly it's hard to believe this isn't a work of historical fiction. I can't believe Evelyn Hugo is not a real person, and that these things didn't happen. 
 Now, I don't consider this next point a spoiler because it's revealed fairly early in the text, but it's not in the goodreads plot summary so if you're very spoiler sensitive skip this sentence ---> . 
 Monique, the woman entrusted with Evelyn's story, is most curious about which of Evelyn's husbands was her true love. We find out that actually Evelyn is bisexual and that her greatest love was a female actress, a costar who transitioned quickly from rival to friend then lover named Celia. There's is the defining relationship of Evelyn's life. As passionately as they are bonded to each other, the need to conceal their relationship exerts a heavy toll. 
 I cannot recommend this book enough. I just adored it. I was moved to the point of tearing up near the end, as the cumulative emotional weight of Evelyn's life washed over me.",Fri Jun 23 20:43:56 -0700 2017,Sat Jun 24 02:26:46 -0700 2017,Sat Jun 24 05:30:21 -0700 2017,Fri Jun 23 20:43:56 -0700 2017,1,0

However, while this is definitely compelling it is also kind of irritating and it left me feeling somewhat underwhelmed when it was all over. This is the kind of book that sucks you in, demands you read on but when it's over you say to yourself, ""oh, that's it."" 
 I think my main beef is for a book with such a dark premise it really chickens out. Grace is a totally insufferable character. She's smug and cold and shallow and oblivious and incredibly whiny yet super, super privileged despite her constant claims to the contrary. I am fine with unsympathetic characters as long as they're interesting, which Grace is for a lot of the book, but I wanted her to really get her comeuppance in a way she never does. Frankly, she needs to suffer more to make this really pay off. She needs to suffer materially and psychologically and emotionally. She needs to be wracked with self doubt and she needs to face hostility from the outside world. This is after all a therapist who just wrote a book castigating women for not avoiding toxic men, and she married a psycho. 
 Korelitz spends a lot of time teasing the audience about the darkness that lurks in the heart of Grace's husband. She really stretches things out. I thought Korelitz did a good job writing the mounting sense of dread Grace experienced, and the actual discovery scenes are quite good. However, once the bombshells finally drop, and they are bombshells, the actual fallout doesn't match the enormity of the betrayal. I think one reason is because Grace is so rich. Her wealth insulates her from a lot of the practical consequences of her husband's betrayal. Most people can't fall back on a six figure bank account and most people can't easily just stop going to work to hide out in their lake houses when things get tough. Her child has zero adjustment issues. Everyone around her is nurturing and supportive as she deals with everything even though she's been such a pill herself throughout the whole book. She has a sweet male neighbor to act as a new love interest. Her ""wrecked"" life is easier and better than most people's lives. I was promised devastation. Devastation I don't get. The actual consequences for Grace should be cataclysmic and they're just not. The only thing she loses is something that has little emotional weight for the reader since Jonathan is a character who exists totally offscreen (or off-page more precisely). 
 All the set up is very good, the payoff is less so. This is a four star book and a two star book mashed together so I'll give it a three star rating.",Mon Jun 12 11:13:30 -0700 2017,Thu Jun 22 23:13:50 -0700 2017,Tue Jun 20 00:00:00 -0700 2017,Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 -0700 2017,0,0

 I loved this book so very much. It is clever and twisty but not convoluted. The reactions to Johnny's clairvoyance feel very realistic. I am a big believer in supernatural stories that have authentic characters with reactions to supernatural phenomena that feel plausible and grounded. Johnny gets famous, he gets publicly roasted as a crank, his coma and subsequent reawakening make his mother's religious mania even more acute. His friends are compassionate but also scared of him. This book is so poignant. The reader becomes so emotionally attached to the characters so quickly. My heart really broke over the thwarted love of Johnny and Sarah. My emotions were completely engaged from page one until the end. 
 And then we get to Stillson. Even though King provides a few excellent vignettes highlighting Stillson's character early in the text, Stillson is not a major player until the third act. The specter of him percolates in the background as Johnny confronts other villainy (such as the Castle Rock strangler) and struggles to reorient himself in the world. He is a shadow lurking at the edges of this story. Stillson is an excellent villain when he finally emerges as a formidable politician and head of his own ""America Now"" splinter party. Try to read his comments in 2017 without a chill running down your spine. King does such a good job capturing the politicial milieu of the 1970's, yet this also feels so disturbingly relevant. A book that totally nails a specific moment in time that nonetheless feels timeless is quite special indeed.

I have a reviewing policy that, no matter how many issues I have with a book, if I can answer ""yes"" to the question ""ultimately, are you glad you read this?"" it deserves at least three stars. So, even though I think this book has glaring flaws, it was still (barely) worth the time investment for what it did well. 
 This is a book with great world building. I loved being immersed in historical information about a culture that I know nothing about. Said historical information was delivered in a very expository, info dumpy kind of way, but I was OK with that. I found the supernatural setting similarly fascinating. I want to emphasize this is a fantasy novel first, a historical fiction novel second. The majority of the narrative takes place in the Chinese afterlife. The actual details of this afterlife were very interesting to me. 
 So what's the problem? Choo built a great world and then peopled with dull characters and a slack, meandering plot. Great descriptions and historical asides alone can't drive a narrative. Choo built the literary equivalent of a really neat diorama but that's it. The plot has no momentum. The characters are mostly passive and bland. 
 Also, the romantic side plot is totally unsatisfying. It should have been jettisoned. I resent how often authors feel obligated to toss slapdash, half hearted romance into a story when they can't do it well.",Mon May 22 18:33:51 -0700 2017,Fri May 26 09:23:35 -0700 2017,Fri May 26 09:23:35 -0700 2017,Mon May 22 18:33:52 -0700 2017,1,0

Orphaned at a young age and sold into sex slavery as a child, she is an understandably embittered adult prostitute when Michael meets her. She is self loathing and self sabotaging, and she lashes out at others because she has learned that kindness = weakness and that any show of vulnerability or even basic humanity will just lead to further victimization and abuse. 
 Michael marries Angel because he receives a call from God to do so. The bulk of the book is focused on Michael's attempts to break down Angel's defenses and accept his unconditional love for her. Michael believes he has a spiritual duty to love Angel, and he treats her with superhuman patience and kindness. He comes to deeply love her outside of the sense of Christian duty that motivated him to marry her. This is a biblical allegory, with Michael's love of Angel representing God's love for humanity. Michael struggles at times to give Angel the type of love she needs, but these struggles have to remain internal because he knows he can't display impatience or short temper with Angel without spooking her off of him. 
 I really appreciated Rivers how wrote Angel's personal redemption. Pain of the type she endured is not quickly cured by the love of a good man, no matter how saintly he is. Her journey towards self acceptance and healing is incremental, and realistic backsliding occurs even after progress is made. She was a very compelling character. Michael is a less dynamic character, but still enjoyable to read about. He is the basically flawless perpetual rock. He's a very sympathetic character, but he isn't 100% realistic. He doesn't have the dimension of Angel, but he was the perfect foil to her. 
 I also enjoyed watching their relationship develop. There's isn't a romance with a lot of heat, but I could totally buy that these characters loved each other. 
 Even though I am an atheist, I do read inspirational fiction which I realize is probably an odd thing to do. I can't speak to how the religious component of this story would work for a devout reader, but I personally found it well written and not off putting or preachy or overly treacly or simplistic at all. This avoids all the potential pitfalls of an inspirational book. You don't have to be even the slightest bit religious to enjoy this.

I really loved Ian and felt for him. He's a fascinating character. I was moved by his tragic backstory of youthful incarceration in an insane asylum and his present ""madness"" (which would be recognized in modern times as Asperger's). Beth had a similarly compelling background, having risen from the workhouse, to vicar's wife, to paid ladies companion, to an independent widow of means when she encounters Ian. 
 I loved these characters individually and I loved them together. I could tell they were well suited from the outset. I do wish Ashley had written some more scenes of couple-y bonding that didn't revolved around their mutual lust for each other, but I bought the romance because when Ashley did actually write them talking to each other about things other then their attractiveness and mutual desire, the scenes were well written. 
 This also had a strong non-romance plot revolving around two unsolved murders. I was also intrigued by the glimpses we got of the other Mackenzie brothers.

Bennett is a genius, and I have been so impressed by his skill and creativity. This is excellently paced, packed with tension and action but also plenty of rich character moments.

 As is par for the course, the writing is beautiful, the characters are compelling, the world building is spectacular, the plot is aces. This also does a great job standing on its own as a distinct, self contained story while also including some satisfying callbacks to what came before in books one and two.

Grace experiences a lot over the course of this relatively slim volume. Before the fire her life is largely confined to her home, caring for her two young children and her taciturn husband Gene. Trips to a visit a friendly neighbor, her widowed mother and the grocery store offer her only respite from the increasingly suffocating nature of her home life. Initially, she considers Gene a decent husband by the standards of his time because he is a good provider but he is cold and his demeanor in the bedroom ranges from brusque to abusive and she becomes increasingly alienated from him. 
 The fire itself is a beautifully written set piece that does a great job establishing the shock, the horror, and the disorientation created by the disaster. The descriptions of the pre-fire drought also provide great foreshadowing. When the fire uproots Grace she is forced to reinvent herself. She has to endure great loss, relocate, provide for her family, and completely reconceptualize what her life is supposed to be. She demonstrates great strength and resilience rebuilding her life, and then (view spoiler)[ surprise!

My only critique is the enigmatic nature of Gene. He is so removed, and then so barbarous, that he remains a mystery as well as a threat to his wife.

Initially, Moyes nails the sense of disorientation Jennifer feels as she tries to reacclimate to her life post-head injury induced amnesia. Her decadent surroundings and cold, imperious husband feel as gross and alien to the reader as they do to her. Her affair with ""B"" is stirring, even though they progress too quickly from ""I'm attracted to you"" to ""I love you forever and forever with an epic, timeless love"" (a common handicap of these types of stories). Moyes didn't cheap out with the supporting characters either. They were interesting and real. I particularly loved Moira, the stuffy secretary desperately pining for Larry. She's a minor character yet in a few pages Moyes built a complicated, flawed, tragic woman who I would have been happy to read a whole book about. 
 The modern story doesn't start until 2/3 of the way in but the transition happens smoothly when it does occur and the modern storyline works pretty well. Generally I found this book smartly constructed. Moyes wrote multiple time jumps within the 1960's as well as the jump to 2003 and I never felt like the transitions were awkward.

It was creepy and thought provoking and anchored by a beautifully developed relationship between Lilac and Tarver. Much of the book was intimate in scope as it focused on their personal struggle for survival, but the authors also did an excellent job hinting at bigger things afoot in the universe. 
 Structurally, this book is written similarly to These Broken Stars. We get alternating point of view chapters from the perspective of each of our protagonists intercut with one page interludes that develop a parallel subplot/provide character background. Kaufman and Spooner really nail this particular structure. They do a great job giving Jubilee and Flynn distinctive narrative voices, and the pacing is top notch. These books are nothing if not page turners. Despite the similar structure though, this feels very different from These Broken Stars. Here we get new characters, a new setting, and a book that tonally bears little resemblance to volume one. 
 Jubilee is a hardened military woman tasked with quelling a rebellion on Avon, a swampy backwater planet chafing under the colonial yoke. She alone is considered immune to ""the Fury,"" a murderous battle madness that grips anyone stationed on Avon for long. Flynn is an ambivalent member of that rebellion who captures Jubilee. Over the course of their acquaintance, they shift from enemies to allies as they navigate the morally murky conflict between Jubilee's occupying force and the Avon rebels and investigate the dastardly LaRoux industries (here we get our connection to book one and our Lilac/Tarver cameo). I really dug the plot and I was impressed with how well Kaufman and Spooner wrote about the ongoing war between Jubilee's army and Flynn's people. 
 My only gripe with this is that Kaufman and Spooner felt it necessary to shoehorn in a romance between Jubilee and Flynn that just didn't work for me. I liked them very much individually as characters, and I enjoyed reading their platonic interactions. I buy them as allies, even friends, but I don't buy them as a couple at all. I don't think Kaufman and Spooner really do either. Romance takes a back seat in this volume, which means when it does come up it feels awkwardly shoe horned in rather than organic to the story. It reads as if Kaufman and Spooner would have preferred to write a book sans romance but, due to the demands of their genre were like ""OK, we'll throw in some kisses, now let's get back to the good stuff."" I wish they could have just jettisoned it entirely because it doesn't read like their heart was into making a romantic connection between Jubilee and Flynn work, and for me it didn't. 
 Still, this was really good and I would highly recommend it. It doesn't pack quite the emotional punch that These Broken Stars did, but it stands well as it's own story and does a good job both expanding on book one and setting up what hopefully will be an excellent book three.",Sat Apr 08 07:00:39 -0700 2017,Sun Apr 09 09:58:36 -0700 2017,Sun Apr 09 10:54:05 -0700 2017,Sat Apr 08 07:00:40 -0700 2017,2,2

I thought this had a great premise, and the execution of the premise was strong in the first half of the book. Baru is a child when her home island of Taranoke is colonized by the Empire of Masks. The Empire is repulsed by what they perceive as the savagery and moral turpitude of the Taranoki way of life, most especially their polyamorous, sexually fluid families. Baru is a child of a three parent family, a mother and two fathers, who is taken away from her family to be sent to a school analogous to the boarding schools Native American children were sent to in America to cut them off from their native culture and indoctrinate them into the ""American"" way of life. One of her fathers is killed. Other residents of Taranoke are physically punished if found to be homosexual, or are forced to participate in eugenics inspired forced breeding or sterilization. They become totally economically dependent on the advanced goods of the Empire. 
 Baru is intelligent enough and cunning enough to excel at her schooling and ace a civil service exam allowing her to work as an imperial accountant within the empire and she schemes to take it down from within to avenge her homeland. What an awesome idea right? Dickinson's treatment of Baru's harrowing childhood was excellent and reading about Baru using her economic cunning to (for example) manufacture ruinous hyper inflation was actually really fun. Dickinson has a lot of clever ideas, and a sophisticated grasp of power dynamics within and between countries. 
 However, the momentum stalled out for me a lot once Baru (view spoiler)[ leaves her post as imperial accountant to become a faux revolutionary (hide spoiler)] The main problem is that most of the characters are so underdeveloped that they are practically indistinguishable from each other. Only Baru and Tain Hu, a rebellious duchess and (view spoiler)[ the object of Baru's deeply repressed lesbian affections (hide spoiler)] approach even two dimensional status. Everyone else is basically just a confusingly named cipher who exists to advance the plot but has no discernible personality. I had the luxury of reading this whole book over the course of one day. I read half of it in one sitting, put it down for about 90 minutes, picked it up again and read the second half. Even with the ability to block out the bulk of my day and read this with minimal distractions/other demands on my time, it was hard at times to keep track of who was who and what was going on as the ensemble cast grew because the characters were so nondescript. So you have two underdeveloped characters, flanked by characters that aren't even one dimensional. Can you have a ""zero dimensions"" character? If so, Dickinson wrote about a dozen of them. 
 Baru is both by nature and by necessity a cold, closed off person, and tonally the book adopts her remoteness. So as interesting as this book was plot-wise, as I intrigued as I was by some of Dickinson's ideas and by the mechanics of Baru's work, it suffers from diminishing returns as it progresses because of how detached the reader is from every character.

I guess I would call this a horror version of Alice in Wonderland if I had to call it anything. Or maybe I would call this The Odyssey on all the acid. The lead character Ben goes on a ""hike"" where all kinds of strange and disturbing wackiness ensues. Everything begins when Ben witnesses a hideous masked man disposing of a child's mutilated body. As he flees this murderer and his accomplice he encounters all kinds of fantastical creatures and bizarre situations as he ""stays on the path."" 
 This book is creative and unique. Magary writes short, punchy sentences and while his prose is economical, it's also powerful and he writes some very vivid and arresting scenes. His writing is very cinematic. This feels like a book written with a future TV or film adaptation in mind. It would be very easy to translate to a visual medium. 
 The sheer weirdness of this did hold my attention (for a while anyway), and I was curious to see what crazy thing was going to happen next. However, I was put off by the lack of structure and coherence to the narrative. This book was a string of wacky events rather than a traditional narrative. There's not much rhyme or reason to anything. The middle of the book also kind of stalled out for me, as the shock value of the craziness wore off. I like my fantasies with some rules and structure and some world building. Otherwise you just have a grab bag of weird anecdotes strung together, which is what a lot of this book is. The heavily episodic nature of the story means you don't have a lot of characters that you follow over the course of the book which makes it hard for Magary to establish dramatic stakes. I definitely liked things about this but it was also a little too weird for me to fully engage with.",Thu Mar 23 15:36:03 -0700 2017,Thu Mar 23 18:26:31 -0700 2017,Thu Mar 23 16:54:37 -0700 2017,Thu Mar 23 15:36:04 -0700 2017,0,0

Eva and Ian were compelling characters and together they were a couple that I really rooted for. The narrative alternates between the present and the past where we get flashbacks fleshing out the relationship between Ian, Eva and Hamilton. In the present Ian, returned from battle in India, is nursing his guilt over the death of Eva's husband and their mutual friend Hamilton and Eva has been institutionalized following the death of her young son (view spoiler)[ who naturally, we find out at the end of the book is not dead, his death was faked by her devious brother (hide spoiler)]. She is kept in horrible circumstances, starved and abused by the asylum workers and addicted to laudanum. When Ian breaks her out of the asylum under false pretenses, Ian and Eva reconnect while trying to evade capture. 
 I appreciated how Claremont wrote Ian and Eva's interactions in both the present and in the flashbacks. In the present Claremont does a good job balancing serious heart to hearts and commiseration over shared tragedy with a few lighter moments of connection. In the flashbacks we learn how these childhood sweethearts were kept apart by a sense of duty to Hamilton's father, and Hamilton himself. For a lot of the book Ian has a somewhat of a ""I must control you for your own protection, fragile woman"" thing going on but a) it's not really inappropriate given the circumstances (Eva is weakened from the brutal conditions of the asylum, detoxing from laudanum and being pursued by the murderous asylum keeper) and b) by the end of the book Ian actually realizes that his over protectiveness might do more harm than good. 
 There are a few things brushed over a little too quickly en route to the climax (primarily Eva's withdrawal) but I would still highly recommend this.",Fri Mar 10 18:37:10 -0800 2017,Tue Mar 14 10:20:17 -0700 2017,Sun Mar 12 08:48:55 -0700 2017,Fri Mar 10 18:37:11 -0800 2017,0,0

Your answer will determine how you feel about this book. There's no connection between the two works in terms of plot, but the tone of this book is incredibly Gilmore Girls-esque. Willis writes all her banter-y dialogue (spoken and telepathically communicated) as if it is coming from the hyper verbal, hyper caffeinated, hyper pop culture referencing mouths of Lorelai and Rory. Briddey's wacky, nosy family and co-workers are very reminiscent of the secondary characters of Stars Hollow. I could not stop thinking about the Gilmore Girls as I read this. If the thought of ""science fiction Gilmore Girls, the book"" makes you smile, I think you'll enjoy this as much as I did. If that thought makes you recoil, stay far away from this. 
 Much of this book is written as a screwball comedy. Briddey, an executive at a smart phone company, agrees to receive an EED implant to allow direct emotional communication with her boyfriend Trent, who wants her to have the procedure before he proposes. An EED is a brain implant which allows you to read the emotions of an individual you have a strong emotional bond with. Briddey has the procedure done but things go awry. Instead of emotionally bonding with her boyfriend, she finds herself telepathically communicating with her snarky coworker C.B. Much of the book is based around Briddey dealing with her new and unexpected telepathic gifts, which bring her closer to C.B., a long time telepath, and away from Trent. Her telepathy has to be carefully managed. Through him she learns more about why she and C.B. (view spoiler)[ and the other members of her family (hide spoiler)] specifically are telepathic. (view spoiler)[ Willis goes with ""an Irish genetic predisposition to telepathy"" (hide spoiler)]. The plot eventually gets a bit heavier, as we get our inevitable ""the telepaths must hide their gifts from those who seek to exploit them"" in the third act but on the whole this stays pretty light. 
 I thought this book was a lot of fun. I enjoyed the breezy tone and found a lot of the verbal pyrotechnics clever. The ""science"" in this science fiction is pretty light lifting, which is fine by me as I like my science fiction on the soft side, but the plot is plenty entertaining. Your suspension of disbelief has to be high to appreciate this but if you can get on Willis's zany wavelength it's quite delightful. I really appreciated how Willis wrote Briddey and C.B.'s relationship. She did an excellent job making me care about these characters and their relationship, even though there are some troublesome aspects to how C.B. treats Briddey (why yes, there is some paternalistic ""I need to guide and protect you and thus lie to you"") business. Man did I love their scene in the library. Willis also does an great job capturing the frantic feeling of communication overload. 
 Some of the humor was overly broad and repetitive. Briddey's sisters are one note characters, and Willis strikes that one note over and over and over (boy crazy for the wrong men! hysterically overprotective helicopter mother!). We get it already, move on. The payoff for Aunt Oona was funny though. 
 There's not a lot of heft to this book, but it's fun light read.",Sat Feb 18 09:05:10 -0800 2017,Mon Feb 20 14:08:34 -0800 2017,Mon Feb 20 14:08:34 -0800 2017,Sat Feb 18 00:00:00 -0800 2017,0,0

This won't win any awards for originality but Stuart's skillful execution of some admittedly well worn tropes was pleasing to me as a reader. Stuart writes well, her plotting is brisk and she packs plenty of intrigue into 270 pages. We've got secret identities and double crosses, murder and other assorted mayhem, marital infidelities, secret accidental funding of Irish terrorism, and of course the steadily increasing sexual tension between Bryony and Adrian as Bryony goes undercover as a housekeeper in Adrian's household to investigate the death of her unjustly disgraced father. 
 The romance is based primarily on flirtation and sexual attraction. There's lots of fun banter and heat and longing. Generally, I would like a romance story to feature a longer courtship and a more substantive connection between the leads beyond the carnal but in this case I enjoyed Briony and Adrian's dynamic even if I acknowledge it was kind of shallow. I liked Briony and Adrian a lot as individual characters, and I totally bought into their compatibility. 
 I look forward to continuing this series.",Sun Feb 12 09:40:38 -0800 2017,Thu Feb 23 06:39:16 -0800 2017,Fri Feb 17 00:00:00 -0800 2017,Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 -0800 2017,0,0

Rhine, a minor character in Jenkins's Through the Storm, is a wealthy saloon owner and Republican councilman who is the biracial son of a slave master and his slave. He is light skinned enough to pass as white, which he does. When he meets Eddy she is near death after being burgled en route to California to work as a cook and hopefully open her own restaurant. They have a strong attraction to each other, but Eddy refuses to indulge it believing she can never be with a ""white"" man and Rhine is yoked to a rich, white fiancee acquired to further his political ambitions and faces the loss of his white privilege if confesses his true racial lineage to be with Eddy. 
 This doesn't have a fast paced, action packed plot but Jenkins does such a good job making her characters and Virginia City come alive that all the details feel important and the pace doesn't drag. There are also plenty of supporting characters and subplots to keep things interesting. Eddy recuperates from her attack in the desert and then settles into Virginia City as a boardinghouse cook. She becomes close with several residents of the town and is briefly and unsuccessfully courted by another man. Rhine goes to council meetings, hits on Eddy to no avail, runs his businesses, is an active crusader for civil rights, and deals with his crazy fiancee. Rhine and Eddy have excellent chemistry when their paths intersect, bantering and flirting. More than anything else, I just really enjoyed spending time in the world Jenkins created as a reader. Jenkins does a good job making them interesting characters as individuals as well as teasing their romance. There's not too much sexual content but what is there is hot. 
 I feel like romance novels are generally formulaic enough not to require spoiler tags but I will be talking about the ending in general terms so if you're exceptionally spoiler sensitive do not read on. Vague sort of spoilers start now ------>. My only criticism is I do think the ending is too abrupt. I wish we had seen more of Rhine and Eddy actually as a couple and I think the consequences of Rhine deciding to no longer pass as white are too quickly brushed aside. I would also think Rhine's revelation would necessitate a move that doesn't happen.",Tue Feb 07 09:39:39 -0800 2017,Fri Feb 10 13:54:53 -0800 2017,Fri Feb 10 13:54:53 -0800 2017,Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 -0800 2017,1,0

There's corny dialogue, cliched melodrama, and bar none one of the stupidest plot twists I have ever read. I am of course referring to the (view spoiler)[ surprise! Julia's ""dead"" husband Xavier lives! (hide spoiler)] silliness. WTF. However, as much of the thinking, reasoning, part of me was fully cognizant of what a tire fire this book is, I can't pretend I didn't enjoy reading it. I love a good historical soap opera that spans multiple generations and as stupid as this book was in parts, I also found it fun and entertaining. Enjoyment beat out irritation at the ludicrousness of what I was reading. 
 In the present we have Julia, a renowned classical pianist dealing with the death of her family, and being romanced by Kit, the inheritor of the Wharton estate. No one in this book has a normal job. Imagine if Julia had been an accountant or a paralegal or a cashier. The characters have to be wealthy and ""artistic"" enough to sulk for months in their picturesque estates and country cottages without any practical concerns intruding on the melodrama. Kit is similarly tortured by lost love and unencumbered by the day to day cares of an actual person. Of course, they quickly fall in love despite Julia's supposed despondency. Their relationship made me feel warm and fuzzy and roll my eyes at the same time. 
 Julia's grandparents were in service at the Wharton estate, and her grandmother's reminisces over a relocated diary send the reader back into the past, where we read about Harry Crawford's legitimate (WWII captivity) and not so legitimate (poor little rich boy doesn't want to inherit and run giant estate and marry a society lady) problems. While convalescing in Thailand he falls in love with a Thai teenager because he loves her skinny, delicate body and her reticence about speaking English makes her less mouthy than his wife Olivia. Yup. That's an aspirational love story for the ages right there. All of this is after Harry thinks he's gay and then decides, eh, no after macking on a school mate. Alright. There are of course spooky secrets from the past, i.e. (view spoiler)[ babies with secret parentage (hide spoiler)]

This novel is set in the distant future, in Chinese controlled Scandinavia, where global warming caused flooding and protracted resource wars and oil and potable water shortages have left what's left of the world poor and beholden to restrictive military rule. The protagonist Noria is a young tea master who over the course of the book deals with learning her father's trade and then learning to cope with his death, guarding a secret water source, surreptitiously assisting a close friend and her family who are in perpetually dire straits as military surveillance steadily increases and the discovery of a puzzling and troubling mystery from a ""twilight century"" of disappeared history. 
 Dystopian novels have been very trendy for the last several years, meaning the market is been glutted with a lot of interchangeable books that feel like they've been rolled off an assembly line. I appreciated how much this book avoided the tropes of the genre and actually felt distinctive. 
 This is an intimate story. The cast of characters is small, there's not a lot of exposition, and plot is low on action, relying instead on the slow escalation of tension. I found it a nice change of pace to read a book like this where the protagonist isn't a shiny, special chosen one, and her problems, while serious, are grounded in her personal circumstances rather than a large scale ""OMG the world is ending and only I can stop it"" impending apocalypse or rebellion. The small scale nature of this story did mean that in a few instances the world building wasn't as thorough as I would have liked, but there was plenty that was intriguing to me about this world even if it was somewhat underdeveloped. 
 Also, the author didn't feel obligated to shoe horn in a romance and/or love triangle. This restraint is highly appreciated.",Wed Jan 11 12:43:54 -0800 2017,Sun Jan 15 21:54:58 -0800 2017,Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 -0800 2017,Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 -0800 2017,1,0

I have never read an author so scatologically obsessed in my life, and I read a lot. If I edited out all the times McGuire describes how badly the air stinks of piss and/or crap and/or blood there wouldn't be enough book left to fill a pamphlet. 
 This book is constantly, ostentatiously, gratuitously crude. It is obvious McGuire is laboring to shock and disgust the reader with the grossness of the characters' surroundings but he has such a heavy hand that the reader quickly becomes desensitized and bored. This book's sole narrative purpose is to make the reader think ""eww, icky"" which is juvenile in the extreme. There is no variation in tone, no nuance or dimension to McGuire's writing. Character development is nonexistent, there's no plot to speak of. There's no tension or suspense whatsoever.

The only real connective tissue of the story, the glue holding everything together, is Mansoor, the survivor of the 1996 bomb who is later (view spoiler)[ arrested and imprisoned as an accomplice to the 2003 bombing committed his friend Ayub (hide spoiler)]. Taken as a whole, his story is a tragic gut punch, though I had quibbles with how quickly Mahajan writes the final part of his story (he tries to cover way too much ground in about 10 pages of text). 
 Sadly, I found Shockie and Ayub, (view spoiler)[ the terrorists behind the ""associated small bombs"" in 1996 and 2003 respectively (hide spoiler)] dull characters. I felt at such a remove from both of them and their chapters were a chore. (view spoiler)[ I am very open to reading books that get into the mind of terrorists. I am even open as a reader to feeling some level of empathy for a terrorist character, but I felt like with the transformation of Ayub chapters Mahajan was just checking off boxes on a checklist and writing with such remove that I couldn't get invested (hide spoiler)]. Vikas and Deepa, the parents of Mansoor's slain friends, were potentially interesting characters but they're grafted onto the story in a very ungainly way. The books opens on their pain at the loss of their sons, then they're dropped completely from the story as we follow other characters, then periodically re-inserted in seemingly random fashion. I'm also not convinced either of them had much of a journey as a character despite the strength of some of their scenes.

 This book is creepy from page one. It is consistently unsettling. There's this icky fever dream quality to the whole thing. Abbott's highly stylized writing, which I largely loved though it was occasionally confusing, and the frequent interjection of Lizzie's dreams into the story create this otherworldly horror atmosphere. Evie's kidnapping is in and of itself disturbing, and Abbott soaks every page with this dark, foreboding, sordid atmosphere. Reading this is an intense sensory experience. 
 The resolution of Evie's story is well foreshadowed, powerful and dramatically satisfying, as dark and gross as it is. Detailed spoilers about the ending under the tag. (view spoiler)[ Evie is motivated by her sexual jealousy of her sister Dusty's inappropriate relationship to their father to initiate a relationship with a forty year old man. Dusty is similarly aggressive in asserting her proprietary interest in their father. Portraying Evie and Dusty as such seemingly ""willing"" victims of predatory adult men will probably be a controversial narrative choice for some readers. I don't think Abbott is engaging in victim blaming or arguing that Evie and Dusty are morally responsible for their own victimization though. She writes a detailed description of Evie's first rape which makes Shaw's moral culpability crystal clear despite Evie's misguided ""desire"" for him. She also shows how Mr. Verver has disgustingly groomed his children to make them ""want"" relationships with adult men, just as he grooms Lizzie over the course of Evie's disappearance. For these reasons, I have no problem with Abbott writing Evie as a girl who ""wanted"" to be raped and Dusty as a girl who ""wants"" to have an incestuous relationship with her father. I found the severity and complexity of the dysfunction fascinating as a reader. (hide spoiler)] 
 My only quibble is I do wish Abbott went into Evie's head a bit more though and explored her thoughts/feelings in more detail. We see this very twisted dynamic through Lizzie's eyes rather than through Evie's, although (view spoiler)[ Mr. Verver's gross innuendos towards Lizzie (hide spoiler)] give us a strong sense of how (view spoiler)[ his perversion (hide spoiler)] has warped all three girls so badly.

The characters are all super privileged, and their ""problems"" such as they are are self made and/or problems of affluence. Close asks you to sympathize with ""struggles"" like ""my lucrative, prestigious job is not exactly the job I want, how I suffer"" or ""my husband doesn't help me enough with our kid even though we're rich enough to have hired help, live right next to doting family and all I do work wise is a goofy, part-time hobby job selling jewelry to my vapid, bitchy friends."" It's hard for an author to create high stakes narratively when everyone is so well off. Even when things get heavier with the marital problems between Beth/Matt and Jim/Ash as they are put through the wringer of a political campaign the reader always sees the safety nets the characters have that ensure true disaster will never strike. 
 This seems like a pretty negative start to a four star review I realize. I start this way only to show how easily this book could have gone awry. It's a minor miracle that it doesn't. Despite writing in the difficult genre of ""upper class people dealing with their extremely first world problems"" this book is actually really good. Close is a consistently witty writer. Her wry observational eye make this a joy to read. Stylistically, her writing is a treat. 
 I don't know D.C. well (I've taken a few short trips there but never spent real time in the city) so this is a guess on my part but this book also feels super authentic in its discussions of what it would be like for these specific characters to live in D.C. If it is as realistic as it feels I congratulate Close for doing such a good job recreating the social milieu of White House staffers and their families. If it's not, I congratulate her anyway for simulating authenticity so well. 
 The main characters are not very sympathetic in a ""I'd like to know these people"" way but they are interesting people who command your attention on the page. Their relationships are textured and compelling. Close does a good job writing complex friendships, marriages and workplace relationships. The secondary characters are also vivid and entertaining. I'm not of the belief characters have to be likable to create a good reading experience. If you need likable protagonists I'd skip this one but if you're fine reading about some fairly obnoxious people as long as the writing itself is of high quality, I'd recommend this.

 Tonally, this whole series reminds me of a beloved show of mine, Call the Midwife. Balogh handles tragedy with tenderness and empathy, and writes most of her characters as individuals who conduct themselves with quiet dignity and decency. There is a warmth that radiates off of each page that is totally intoxicating to the reader. 
 George is a 48 year old widower, long single after his first wife's suicide following the death of their child in the Napoleonic Wars. Dora is a 39 year old spinster who has settled into a quiet life of music instruction after family scandal permanently postponed her debut and left her in charge of the upbringing of her much younger sister. 
 After finally tiring of his solitude, George impulsively proposes marriage to Dora, promising kindness and companionship if not great romance. So this book traces a post marriage courtship, as George and Dora fall in love with each other after they've been joined together in matrimony. Watching their love bloom is absolutely delightful. George and Dora are characters both strongly motivated by feelings of duty and self sacrifice, which prevented them from finding love earlier in life, and George struggles with guilt over the dysfunctional state of his first family. 
 Watching these characters grow together and find the love they so richly deserve was so satisfying and joyful.

It's very realistic (that's right, I'm calling a book about people who suddenly get super powers realistic) that newly created ""epics,"" would become so warped by their power that they would be at best indifferent to regular human life and at worst actively murderous. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Regular people would be like ants to super beings. 
 So the main showdown in this book is between the Reckoners, a dedicated band of epic assassins, and Steelheart, the epic ruler of Newcago. We follow new reckoner recruit David, seeking to avenge his murdered father. David is a bit too implausibly knowledgeable and perfect but I guess that comes with the territory with this type of book. 
 This is quite the fast paced read. It's pretty action-y which isn't usually my thing but Sanderson writes well enough for me to get into it for the most part. As the book goes on Sanderson not only delivers a clever, propulsive plot but he injects more moral complexity and nuance into the narrative. He also writes strong individual character moments for David, lead reckoner Prof and my favorite character Megan. 
 Highly recommended.",Fri Nov 04 14:30:00 -0700 2016,Tue Nov 08 07:18:30 -0800 2016,Tue Nov 08 10:24:26 -0800 2016,Fri Nov 04 00:00:00 -0700 2016,1,0

Balogh has a knack for writing well developed characters that the audience develops a strong attachment to.

 I thought Hodge did a really good job maintaining a consistently creepy atmosphere. This book is really dark and unsettling at times. The Gentle Lord's castle is a fantastic set piece. This is the literary equivalent of a haunted house movie because so much of the plot is driven by Nyx's explorations of this gigantic, sprawling, fearsome castle. Nyx, Ignifex, and Shade are all interesting characters with complicated motivations. I really appreciated how Nyx wasn't all pure and noble and self sacrificing but was appropriately bitter about her lot in life. I didn't really buy into the love triangle between Nyx, Ignifex, and Shade but it didn't detract from all the other things I was enjoying about the story. 
 However, as the climax of the book approaches things went off the rails for me. By the end the plot had become pretty convoluted with all the magical artifacts and mythological allusions and shifting alliances and the resolution to all this craziness, the whole (view spoiler)[ time unwinding thing (hide spoiler)] just left me scratching my head. I didn't understand the mechanics of that at all. (view spoiler)[ How was Nyx even alive in the first place if the last 900 years hadn't happened? She only exists in the first place because of the bargain between her father and the gentle lord. Shouldn't the world be totally different in every way? (hide spoiler)] I was just a pile of confusion from that plot point to the end. I really don't think this book needed the introduction of that type of plot element given how much was already going on.

Though the male protagonist of this story is a vampire, don't come into this expecting a dark and scary read. The tone of this book is light and sweet. Though Ian (view spoiler)[ is almost killed by Ben the vampire hunter (hide spoiler)] and Angelica is (view spoiler)[ kidnapped by a vampire named Rosetta acting to protect John Polidori, author of ""The Vampyre"" (hide spoiler)] these potentially grave problems are completely resolved with ridiculous quickness and don't alter the breezy tone Ann affects throughout. 
 This book doesn't have a lot of depth to it in terms of plot, world building or characterization but if you go in ready for a light entertainment it's got charm.

I kicked off Abbott week with her latest work, You Will Know Me, a very well written and psychologically astute mystery set in the world of elite gymnastics. After reading and enjoying that book so thoroughly, I dove right into Dare Me, a dark and twisted tale of adultery, murder and really bitchy cheerleaders. 
 I enjoyed this. I like how Abbott writes stylistically. She uses distinctive descriptive language and does a great job creating vivid imagery without overwriting. She's witty too. I also think she did a good job capturing the way teen girls can be so smotheringly close to each other and so mean and destructive simultaneously. 
 However, this did also leave me wanting more. I thought this book could have easily been a hundred pages longer. Specifically I wanted more scenes of the coach enslaving the team to her cruel charisma, focusing on how she balanced her meanness with star power and persuasiveness to get everyone but Beth to buy in, more Beth and Addy scenes, and further development of coach's relationship to both her husband and Will. There's too much summarizing instead of showing how these characters interact with each other. I never really could grasp the source of the coach's power. 
 Also, every character is so terrible, a little variation in tone and characterization would have been appreciated. I have no problem with dark books, dark material and unsympathetic characters but nobody lives in a world where every single person in their life is completely awful all the time.",Mon Oct 10 22:39:10 -0700 2016,Tue Oct 11 13:55:05 -0700 2016,Tue Oct 11 13:55:05 -0700 2016,Tue Oct 11 00:00:00 -0700 2016,1,0

I found the way everyone treated Alice, sufferer of a very serious head injury, totally unrealistic. She just plops back into her life despite losing a decade of memories and no one directly communicates with her about the ten years she loses or even seems particularly alarmed about her condition. No one sits her down and says ""OK, let me tell you what you're not remembering...and maybe you shouldn't be tending children, driving and baking giant novelty pies (yes, there's a giant pie subplot) while coping with mysterious brain damage."" She's half heartedly told to see a doctor twice maybe and that's it. 
 Moriarty also doesn't do a completely satisfactory job of answering the question ""why did Alice change so much?"" which is kind of the whole frigging point of the book. She spends so much time teasing us with mysteries that wouldn't be so mysterious if people just had mutually beneficial straightforward conversations with each other that Alice's actual transformation arc gets relegated to a small section of the overall text. To say Alice is a poorly developed character is an overstatement but a 460 page character study could have and should have done this better. We get a good sense of certain parts of her devolution but not all of it. Maybe if we didn't waste so much time reading stupid letters from Frannie we could have gotten to it. 
 Despite these problems, which are significant, this book is a super page turner. I read three quarters of it in one sitting. Moriarty did a great job creating in me a thirst to keep learning more about these characters and to solve the two major puzzles she introduces ""why did Alice and Nick split up?"" and ""what's the deal with this Gina person that everyone keeps talking about in hushed tones?"" Again, in the real world Alice would just have those questions answered for her in a five minute conversation and there'd be no book but my awareness of the contrived nature of these mysteries didn't totally dampen my enjoyment. 
 Softie that I am, I can't give a book that really compelled me to keep turning the pages less than 3 stars no matter how many nitpicks I have. Of the four Moriarty books I've read (this, The Husband's Secret, Big Little Lies, and The Last Anniversary) this is the weakest but for all its flaws this book is hard to put down and for me that counts for a lot in terms of how I rate a book. This is the kind of book that really casts a spell over you and demands you keep reading no matter how frustrated you get at times by its shortcomings.",Sat Oct 01 22:16:54 -0700 2016,Mon Oct 03 22:22:21 -0700 2016,Wed Oct 05 00:00:00 -0700 2016,Sun Oct 02 00:00:00 -0700 2016,0,0

The main plotline is perfect: Jane and Oliver are great characters individually and a couple. I was totally invested in them. All the scenes of Jane's calculated social suicide were so fun to read. What a bold, distinctive heroine. Oliver burns with by steely ambition and righteousness but this fire is tempered by a passivity and fear borne of his acute awareness of his own precarious social status. How can this man, so conscious of his need to marry well, avoid controversy, and curry favor with parliament to advance his noble ideological objectives court a woman who has deliberately destroyed her own reputation to protect her sister and her fortune? 
 In addition to to this excellent main plot, this book is distinguished by its rich subplots, supporting characters and historical detail. Jane's sister Emily has to endure the overbearing supervision of her uncle and barbaric old school medical treatments of her partial epilepsy, but also enjoys a lovely and sweet romance with an Indian lawyer named Anjan just as swoon worthy as the main coupling. I loved reading about Oliver's spirited suffragette sister Free as well. There is also this ongoing subplot with Oliver's agoraphobic Aunt Freddy that ends with (view spoiler)[ Freddy's death and the revelation that she was secretly the author of Emily's beloved Mrs. Lariger adventure novel series (hide spoiler)] that floored me with how powerful it was given its status as barely a B plot.

I thought James did a really good job of writing many of the individual scenes. Her dialogue is consistently clever. There's an extended comic interlude about a rented pineapple that was amazing. I really liked reading about Merry interacting with English high society. Her and Trent are a charming couple, though their (view spoiler)[ post-marriage conflict about admitting their feelings to each other (hide spoiler)] is contrived. 
 However, as much as I enjoyed many individual scenes in this book, I found a lot of the pivotal plot developments that advance the plot pretty meh. Why does Merry rush into an engagement with Cedric so rashly given her history? I didn't buy the characterization of Cedric at all really, and James is all over the map with him, seesawing between him being a dastardly wastrel and then (view spoiler)[ tossing in a quick redemption for him at the end (hide spoiler)]. Neither version of him feels authentic. And the (view spoiler)[ surprise marriage to Trent instead of Cedric (hide spoiler)] and especially the (view spoiler)[ third act temporary amnesia, I hate this as a plot device (hide spoiler)] didn't work for me.

Whenever an author impresses me as much as Bancroft did of course I want to read more of their work ASAP, but I also have a small, skeptical voice in the back of my mind that says ""don't forget, it's totally possible their other work won't be as good as this was, try to keep your expectations in check."" 
 The truth of the matter though is that I would have been disappointed if this book had been anything less than great after the awe inspiring Senlin Ascends. Thankfully, this book is every bit the masterwork that volume one is. There is no sense of that middle book filler feeling you get in certain series. Every plot development is vital and each new facet of the tower we're exposed to is fascinating. As always, character development is strong and the prose is to die for. Also, I didn't mention this in my review of Senlin Ascends, but I love the short inserts of in world texts that begin each chapter in both volumes. 
 So in short Bancroft is a genius, you need to read this yesterday and reading me heap superlatives on this brilliant book is a waste of time that could be better spent actually reading Arm of the Sphinx. I am so, so glad I happened upon these literary treasures and I wait with baited breath for volume three (please don't pull a Rothfuss on me Bancroft, I need more of your amazing work).",Sat Sep 17 08:52:48 -0700 2016,Sun Sep 18 15:13:52 -0700 2016,Sun Sep 18 15:13:52 -0700 2016,Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 -0700 2016,6,2

I am in awe of Bancroft's skill and creativity. A book this perfect almost feels like it sprung from the brain of an alien far more advanced than a regular human. I am just stunned that this book exists. 
 I started reading this this morning and once I picked it up I didn't put it down until dinner time when I realized all I had eaten over the course of the day was some handfuls of goldfish crackers because I was too transfixed to eat. I reluctantly stepped away to feed myself and picked this up again and read until I finished as soon as I had washed my hands post meal. 
 As I gush in more detail about how amazing this book is I want to re-emphasize that, as effusive as I'm being, my words will inevitably fail to do this book justice, it is that fucking phenomenal. 
 I want to start by talking about Bancroft's facility with language. His Goodreads bio says he is a poet. I don't read poetry ever (my husband used to write poetry and I read and enjoyed his but since he gave it up years ago I can't remember the last time I read a poem) but I can see the value the author's background as a poet brought to this work. I can tell you his prose is beautiful enough that you will stop, pause and re-read passages just because of how the language soars. I am usually not a very visual reader. I don't frequently paint mental pictures of what I'm reading as I read however Bancroft's writing is so vivid and evocative that I really felt like I could see, hear, smell and taste each ring of the tower. It was impossible not to experience this world like I was really there. 
 Plot-wise this manages to feel totally fresh and weird while also feeling totally authentic. Senlin experiences some capital C craziness on his journey but I never thought ""this doesn't feel right"" or ""this isn't believable."" Every plot development feels earned, and the world building is so thorough and smart that the reader is able to totally buy into Bancroft's universe. If I had to compare this to anything, I would compare it to the movie Snowpiercer (which I also loved) in how it well it sells its bold, visionary world. 
 Character development is uniformly top notch. Every character, major or minor, is nuanced and fascinating and compelling. 
 It is a crying shame that this only has 100 or so ratings on Goodreads. I hope it soon earns the popularity it so richly deserves. This is everything a book should be. I'm not one of those people that has a big Goodreads following or anything. I write reviews for myself and assume most of the time I am the only person who reads them but anyone else reading this, I implore you to buy this book and give it a shot. You won't be sorry.",Fri Sep 16 07:26:23 -0700 2016,Fri Sep 16 20:56:06 -0700 2016,Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 -0700 2016,Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 -0700 2016,6,3

Wavy and Kellen are two individuals who have lived spectacularly dysfunctional lives. We follow Wavy almost from birth, as she endures horrendous abuse and neglect from her impoverished, drug addicted parents, punctuated only by sojourns to an aunt's house that offer little solace because Wavy is so unable to connect with her extended family in a healthy way. Kellen, himself a product of a poor, abusive, addicted family a is an enforcer type for Wavy's father Liam, who deals meth. 
 This book traces the development of Wavy and Kellen's relationship over fifteen years, starting from their first meeting when Wavy is eight and Kellen is already an adult. This is a ""love"" story between an adult and a child/young teenager. Wavy and Kellen's relationship is familial but it is also undeniably romantic, and it becomes explicitly sexual when Wavy is thirteen and Kellen is 24/25. Obviously, that will be a deal breaker for a lot of readers, especially because Greenwood is not interested in writing this relationship as something that is wholly negative, or exploitative. 
 Greenwood writes Kellen as a well intentioned man (at least where Wavy is concerned) who is sincerely concerned about Wavy's well being and is not deliberately trying to hurt her or victimize her. He acts as a surrogate father, registering Wavy for school, attending parent teacher conferences as Liam, buying her new shoes every year and as a surrogate husband simultaneously. Even when he engages in what could be considered grooming behavior, i.e. conditioning a child for future sexual abuse, he does so without malicious intent. Despite the age difference, Wavy and Kellen seem at times to interact like peers because adversity has forced Wavy into adopting certain adult behaviors and Kellen seems to be in a state of arrested development socially and romantically. I don't think Greenwood is interested in her readers thinking about his conduct in terms of ""right or wrong"" but in terms of ""how and why."" 
 Greenwood excels at character and relationship development. I completely understood why Wavy felt attracted to Kellen and why Kellen felt attracted to Wavy. They are products of such a twisted world, and it unsurprising that two people stranded in such a hellscape would form a bond that is both gross and inappropriate and loving and tender. I don't think we're supposed to see Wavy and Kellen as some romantic ideal despite their professed love for each other and (view spoiler)[ their eventual marriage and ""happily ever after"" ending (hide spoiler)]. For all the flowery declarations of love they are clearly unhealthy people raised in a toxic environment and unsurprisingly their coping mechanisms and relationship skills have been warped by the abuse they endured. Greenwood doesn't write Kellen as a calculating predator, but she doesn't write him as an aspirational figure either. His flaws are not minimized, nor does Greenwood ignore the negative consequences of the relationship for Wavy. I don't think Greenwood is asking her readers to accept the relationship between Kellen and Wavy as totally normal or acceptable just because they as characters want to downplay the problematic parts of their dynamic. I think Kellen and Wavy are desperate people flailing around looking for love and hope in the only place they can find it in their hard lives. 
 I also think Greenwood did an excellent job utilizing the multiple narrator style here. We get a variety of point of view characters in addition to Wavy and Kellen: family members, friends, teachers, and others. Each of these characters is given a distinctive voice and perspective. They are interesting narrators in their own right, and they also offer an array of perspectives on the Kellen/Wavy relationship that range from enthusiastic acceptance to complete rejection. Her writing style, while not flashy, is also top notch. 
 This book is moving, thought provoking and squirm inducing. I was glued to the page, completely sucked into this story. My feelings towards these characters, what I thought of them and what I wanted for them, were so complicated. For the reader up to exploring dark topics and deeply flawed characters in complicated, boundary pushing ways, this cannot be recommended highly enough. It totally knocked my socks off.",Fri Sep 16 06:38:04 -0700 2016,Fri Dec 30 23:03:19 -0800 2016,Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 -0800 2016,Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 -0800 2016,0,0

 There were things that were charming and likable about this book. I think Carriger writes dialogue well, and her humorous asides and juxtaposition of stuffy Victorian mores with supernatural craziness worked for me. I enjoyed the tone of this book. I also thought Carriger had interesting, albeit underdeveloped, ideas about how society would cope with the existence of vampires and werewolves by trying to bureaucratize and sanitize them. 
 But there's just not a lot to this book. The world building is thin, most of the characters are flat, the plot is slow moving. These flaws I think stem from all the narrative time devoted to the tepid romance between Alexia and Lord Maccon. Maccon is the blandest character to ever bland and so I couldn't care less about his courtship of Alexia. Had this book cut the romance and instead devoted more detail to developing the paranormal plot and fleshing out the characters it would have been much better.",Tue Sep 06 16:12:59 -0700 2016,Tue Sep 13 07:34:44 -0700 2016,Tue Sep 13 07:34:44 -0700 2016,Tue Sep 06 00:00:00 -0700 2016,0,0

Reading multiple books of hers reveals her to be a somewhat formulaic writer but it's a formula I happen to love and that she excels at. English aristocrats and those who serve them + gorgeous setting + fallout from WWI and/or WWII + family secrets + unresolved murder that has to be solved in the present creating a dual timeline structure = lots of material for compelling drama. Her plots are intricate puzzles and her writing is lush with period detail. She paces plot and character reveals well. The scaffolding of this novel is strong. The plot is complex enough that in the hands of a less skilled writer it would have come off as too convoluted but Morton handles the time jumps and narrator switches seamlessly.

I had never heard of it, but it seemed right up my alley so I checked it out of the library. To anyone like me, whose interest in this book was piqued by the upcoming film, let me warn you, this book is awful. It fails in every way a book can fail. It marries an aggressively stupid, laughably contrived plot with pathetically one dimensional characters that don't think, feel or do anything remotely interesting or authentic. 
 Every single thing that happens in this book is stupid. Every choice a character makes, every deception that they're improbably able to engage in, every external event, is ludicrous and underwritten in the extreme : (view spoiler)[ the faux pregnancy, Sophia's feigned deaths, Cornelius's extreme gullibility, everything about the way Maria, a woman in service, behaves, Willem impulsively running off and returning (hide spoiler)] none of it is grounded in any sense of reality. To call the plot of this soap operatic is an insult to soap operas, which peddle more believable plots and contain better characters than this tripe. I am a person who regularly reads fantasy, YA and romance novels. I am not a stickler about historical accuracy in period fiction. I say these things to point about my tolerance for plot contrivance is high. I am willing and able to cut authors a lot of slack in the realism department in service of an entertaining story but I was constantly cringing at how dumb this book was. I felt insulted by how poorly written this book was in every way. 
 The ""romance"" between Sophia and Jan, the supposedly great love that sets the plot in motion, is horrendously written. By page 40 this pair have declared their undying love for each other based on a whopping two chaperoned encounters with each other. Moggach doesn't go through the hassle of actually building a relationship between this pair. There's no time spent building an attraction through multiple interactions, or giving either character a personality. There's no there there, no actual content to their epic, tragic, ruinous love. Moggach states it exists, that's supposed to be good enough for us. This book is super lazy in addition to being totally incompetent.

Our starting point is with Effia and Esi, two half sisters whose lives diverge when Effia is married off to a British slaver to live a life of material comfort far away from her resentful stepmother and Esi is sold into slavery, with all the degradation that entails. Each chapter is a snapshot into the life of one of Effia or Esi's descendants, chronicling a handful of pivotal moments in each of their lives in Ghana and America respectively. Amazingly, we get 14 characters and every one of them is interesting and worth reading about. Gyasi creates strong, vivid characters that feel three dimensional within the space of 20 or so pages and her inclusion of historical information about Ghanese tribal warfare, the slave trade, the Civil War, the Great Migration, the vicissitudes of life in Harlem, etc. is seamless. This is the type of book you'll learn from without feeling like you're doing homework. The last story, where (view spoiler)[ the two branches of the family tree finally coverge with the meeting of Marjorie and Marcus (hide spoiler)] is so gratifying and ties everything up perfectly. 
 As excellent as this book was, and it was a great read that I devoured in one sitting, I can't quite give it 5 stars. Gyasi is so ambitious that her reach exceeds her grasp just a bit and a few of the chapters felt a bit too short for me. I felt a little deprived that this book wasn't longer. Gyasi did such a good job constructing each vignette, I was sad to see one end and another begin. However, if the worst thing you can say about a book is that you wanted more of it, obviously the author has done a great job.

The romance falls completely flat because Nick is a super jerk who is not sufficiently redeemed and Julia is super bland. Her master plan is stupid and contrived in about 10 different ways. The connection between the two characters is purely carnal. One week of good boning doesn't make a satisfying romance. Their relationship is not interesting in any way. 
 If you're not rooting for/invested in the romance this book doesn't offer anything else to entertain the reader. There's not much in the way of subplots, good supporting characters, atmosphere and period detail etc to compensate for a poor leading couple.

We've got backstabbing and gossip and love triangles and secret liaisons and sudden reversals of fortune (positive and negative). I was always interested in seeing what these crazy kids were going to do next. Stylistically, I also really liked how Godbersen used these short inserts from faux newspapers and high society etiquette guides to propel the plot forward/offer commentary on what was going on. 
 However, if you want to read about nuanced characters or if you want any kind of history in your historical fiction beyond lengthy descriptions of old timey dresses I wouldn't recommend this.

It wasn't bad enough to abandon but I didn't really enjoy it either because the pace was so brutally slow. It was like Harris wrote the book to fulfill a dare: write a 500 page book with a novella's worth of actual content! How high can that word count get without communicating anything of substance? 
 There were some things I liked about this book. Until my impatience over how badly everything dragged set in I enjoyed Harris's writing style a great deal and the chapters set in 1933 were excellent. If you are a fast reader with a lot of free time on your hands maybe you'll find slogging through this worthwhile.

Eileen is such a gross, twisted, compelling point of view character. Reading elderly Eileen's self aware analysis of her troubled twenties gives the reader the same type of inexplicable yet undeniable pleasure of tonguing a canker sore or picking a scab. 
 This book is an intense sensory experience. All the descriptive writing here is excellent. Eileen is a bundle of bile and neurosis who surveys her small, dilapidated world with a cruel and cutting eye. She hates her body, her shabby home, her dysfunctional family, her low rent job. She desperately desires some type of human connection yet she is too misanthropic and self-sabotaging to have any kind of relationship with anyone. On the few occasions she does let down her guard and tries to engage she does so with such awkwardness that the reader winces with second hand embarrassment. 
 A book with little plot that exists primarily to showcase a mean, petty, angsty woman exhaustively chronicling her own flaws and detailing a life full of degradation is definitely not something that will appeal to all readers but I thought this was so well written that I wanted to spend even more time in Eileen's sordid world.

The courtship of Roxana and Alex is like watching two cute, awkward, clumsy puppies wrestle with each other. They are a couple that I really rooted for because they were both such fundamentally decent, well intentioned people who were a good match despite their consistent communication difficulties. 
 The only obstacles to this coupling were self imposed by mutual social awkwardness and misunderstanding. This can be frustrating for the reader who longs to call out ""just say what you mean"" but for the most part Roxana and Alex's communication problems were plausibly grounded in their backgrounds/life experiences, temperaments, and the circumstances of their ""forced"" marriage. 
 While Roxana and Alex are a charming couple, this book is pretty thin on plot and secondary characters so even though it's not very long, it does feel a bit dull and sluggishly paced at times.

Dragonscale is a really fascinating affliction and Hill does a great job writing about its array of symptoms and its transmission. I loved the first portion of this book, which chronicles Harper's contracting the 'scale (as the characters refer to it) and its impact on her relationship with her demented husband Jakob and I thought Hill wrote a lot of the interpersonal drama within the survivor's camp well. While not every camp denizen is a memorable character, enough of them are to create some really compelling drama. 
 However this book is way too long. Way, way too long. In particular, the last 250 pages or so needed to be drastically condensed.

Before I listened to her spectacular twelve part podcast on Manson I actually didn't know much about the Manson family and their crimes. I read this with all the actual historical information very fresh on my mind due to Longworth's work. 
 I loved how Cline wrote this. The prose is definitely on the flowery side and deliberately arty but it works really well. I think Cline really nailed the mix of adolescent insecurity and parental neglect that made the cult so seductive to Evie. I felt like I understood her, her motivations, and her world well. Cline's writing is very perceptive, and she is able to make her characters come alive quickly. I also really appreciated the quiet melancholy of the chapters narrated by middle aged Evie in the present day. 
 Even though this is a novel, I couldn't help but compare it to the actual Manson crimes as I read. The allusions to the real crimes are numerous yet, as dark as this books gets, the true story is even crazier and more depraved. Which means as skillfully as this is written, there's nothing in it that would surprise a reader familiar with the details of the Manson killings.

 Perfect characters don't interest me as a reader. Lou and Will are both realistically flawed people who have complex interactions with each other, with their dysfunctional families, and with the wider world. Yet for all their foibles, Moyes did a great job of illustrating how well Lou and Will fit together and how much they need each other. I really liked how well Moyes wrote all the relationships in this book and how well she constructed Lou and Will's personal universes. They feel like authentic, three dimensional people with mostly plausible and identifiable life trajectories up until their meeting (exception: Will's great wealth is a bit of a contrivance). The development of their relationship is moving and well written. Moyes doesn't take shortcuts but skillfully sketches the gradual evolution of Will and Lou's relationship from one of animosity to cordiality to friendship to love.

I found Jonas a very interesting and appealing character whose abrasiveness was well justified in text and didn't detract from his ultimately progressive, forward thinking and kind nature. I also thought his relationship with his father was quite poignant. I love me some old timey medical discussions and sociological commentary and again Milan delivers here. I really enjoyed many of the individual scenes in this novella a great deal because of how well Milan writes. 
 Lydia's personal character arc was interesting but some elements of the courtship of Lydia and Jonas were really odd despite them being good characters as individuals. Bizarrely, Lydia is constantly cited as a chipper, optimistic, naively cheery character and we the audience don't see that in this volume. I don't have a problem with that per se. I don't need characters to be all sweetness and light. I think Lydia's anger and attitude were totally legitimate and her prickliness matched well with Jonas's brusque exterior. However, it was really jarring to be told over and over again ""Lydia's public disposition is all sunshine and rainbows"" when we don't see evidence of that. Since we never see this supposedly defining aspect of her personality her wager with Jonas (that he can show her scenes of poverty that challenge her relentless optimism in exchange for a kiss) makes no sense. It also makes no sense that Jonas's initial attraction to Lydia is this same oft referenced but textually nonexistent cheeriness. 
 I enjoyed reading Jonas and Lydia's sparring. I thought their verbal repartee was entertaining but what Milan showed us about their relationship through how they interacted seemed quite different from how she told us we should interpret these interactions. I rooted for Jonas and Lydia as a couple but I think these two characters would have benefitted from more time in which to tell their story.

Gay does a really good job manufacturing tension and suspense even though the reader knows from the opening sentences Mireille does escape captivity. It is obviously disturbing reading about the extreme violation of a person's body and the resulting dissolution of their spirit. This book really puts the reader through the wringer emotionally chronicling Mireille's abuse and then her attempts to recover after her release. I think Gay did a really good job with this material, writing about trauma and (partial) recovery in a way that felt realistically complex and compelling in my admittedly inexpert opinion. 
 In terms of criticisms I felt like too much time was devoted to fleshing out the backstory of Mireille and Michael's twerpy courtship and marriage, which was the least interesting part of the story, and not enough time was devoted to Mirielle's family. I would have liked more flashback time devoted to Mirielle's parents in particular and maybe a little more commentary on Haiti itself. Also, there was one minor plot twist at the end I really didn't like. It wasn't a big deal, it was literally two pages at the very end of the book, but it was really contrived and annoying. Specifically, I am referring to the whole (view spoiler)[ the Commander shows up as a busboy in Miami (hide spoiler)] lameness.

The scope of the story is narrower, the plot more simple and straightforward. I wouldn't like every book in the series to be like this, but despite some problems with the initial set up I really enjoyed this very different volume in the Matthew Corbett series. 
 I really enjoyed the very beginning of this book before the plot gets underway but then I found the set up of the chase between Corbett and Slaughter quite dumb. Matthew Corbett and his colleague Hudson Greathouse, supposedly savvy investigators, get so easily manipulated by the transparently evil Slaughter that it comes off as quite contrived. Their implausible stupidity is a poor way to kick off the plot. 
 However, this is just so compulsively readable I can't give it less than four stars. I just adore how McCammon writes. I loved the prose, the dialogue, the intensity of the actual chase itself, the twisted depravity of Slaughter, the well drawn roster of supporting characters and despite the weak start this plot actually develops and resolves in a very satisfactory way.",Fri Mar 25 05:48:24 -0700 2016,Sat Apr 02 06:56:57 -0700 2016,Sat Apr 02 06:56:57 -0700 2016,Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 -0700 2016,0,0

 This book felt both overwritten and underwritten. By overwritten I mean Yapa's often beautifully vivid descriptions slipped into repetitive melodrama at times. Some of the language was just too flowery, it became kind of tortured and even laughable in a few instances. By underwritten, I mean that I didn't fully buy into certain characters, meaning they didn't feel completely authentic and their actions did not feel organic. I think trying to do justice to 7 point of view characters in just 300 pages was too tall an order. Yapa would have been better off focusing on 3 or 4 characters tops so he could have done them full justice. 
 However, despite these flaws this is a book worth reading. Yapa does a great job stirring the reader's emotions with his visceral, cinematic descriptions of WTO protests. I also really liked how he integrated flashbacks in a way that reinforced the overheated, disorienting nature of the protests once the violence began. The descriptions of police brutality are really gutting, and feel very relevant in 2016. While I initially didn't care for the interludes with the Sri Lankan finance minister and didn't think they were necessary, the final payoff was great and really packed a wallop. 
 This is a book of of great individual scenes. It doesn't really hang together as a cohesive narrative because it is trying to do too much in too short a space, but despite this book's faults parts of it will move and impress you.",Fri Feb 26 08:55:35 -0800 2016,Sun Feb 28 09:22:33 -0800 2016,Sun Feb 28 09:22:33 -0800 2016,Fri Feb 26 00:00:00 -0800 2016,1,0

My expectations were modest. In some ways this book exceeded my expectations, but it also had some of the flaws I anticipated. 
 What this book did better than I anticipated was make me care about many of the characters, even those who don't have large roles, and their relationships. I had a strong emotional connection to this cast. I felt like I had a good understanding of who these people were and why they behaved the way they did. I never wanted to stop spending time with them. 
 However, as much as I enjoyed reading this, elements of both the world building and the plot were pretty flimsy and generic at times, which I assume was inevitable given this universe's origins. Rowell takes an everything and the kitchen sink approach to fantasy tropes, tossing in a great variety of creatures and powers in an entertaining but also haphazard way. There's not a lot of originality here. What originality does exist comes more from the sheer volume of fantasy concepts that have been stuffed into this book rather than from a novel treatment of such genre staples as ""the chosen one"" or ""internal strife amongst different magical castes."" or ""day to day life at magic school."" So as strong as the character development is, and as enjoyable as the book is, it does feel derivative at times and elements of the world building feel rushed or muddled. 
 Even with these flaws, this is definitely a page turner, and you'll be glad you read it.",Sun Feb 21 13:10:03 -0800 2016,Thu Feb 25 11:12:36 -0800 2016,Thu Feb 25 11:12:36 -0800 2016,Sun Feb 21 00:00:00 -0800 2016,0,0

Through the eyes of Harry August, a man who is reborn upon death over and over again, this book surveys many of the most pivotal events of the twentieth century and does so in a fresh, compelling way while also asking heady philosophical questions about the meaning of life, the nature of time itself, and the possibility and desirability of altering history. 
 While a lot of the material here is quite heavy, North also employed wry humor expertly. Much of her writing is darkly witty. Harry is a great character who has a fascinating array of reactions to his continuous reincarnations. Harry frequently skips around in his first person narration of his lives which could have been a real problem in the hands of a less skilled author but North never makes the development of the plot or the characters feel choppy. All the digressions about his lives, all his offhand observations are just as interesting and worthwhile as the main plot. And Harry's extreme longevity allows him the opportunity to build long, complicated, fascinating relationships with a great roster of supporting characters. 
 This book is so ambitious, so bursting at the seams with cool concepts and characters and plot twists, that it was an absolute joy to read from beginning to end.",Mon Feb 01 05:30:56 -0800 2016,Thu Feb 04 23:06:16 -0800 2016,Sat Feb 06 00:00:00 -0800 2016,Mon Feb 01 00:00:00 -0800 2016,1,0

We get discussion of battlefield and field side medical conditions in WWI, shell shock, WWI-era psychiatry, a protracted legal drama that takes up the second half of the book, references to thwarted love affairs and bad marriages. 
 There is enough material here for a great book and I devoured this quickly. Stella as a protagonist, the setting, the major plot points, most of the supporting characters all really worked for me. 
 I do think that Shreve's reach exceeds her grasp though, and the book is too short to do full justice to its multitude of topics. I think in particular the therapeutic treatment of shell shock needed more elaboration. I would have been interested in an even more detailed exploration of some of Stella's relationships as well.",Thu Jan 14 15:32:57 -0800 2016,Sat Jan 16 01:07:43 -0800 2016,Sat Jan 16 01:07:43 -0800 2016,Thu Jan 14 00:00:00 -0800 2016,0,0

It's a shallow, scattershot mess populated by obnoxious ciphers who are squabbling over a trust fund. Oh no, their trust fund might not be as big as they'd like. What compelling drama, what high stakes. Don't you want to read about rich, privileged assholes threaten to throw tantrums like a bunch of Veruca Salts? I think this aspires to be a comedy but it's not funny. It's not funny, it's not dramatic, it's only irritating. I picked this up because I like books written about complicated family dynamics but what I read was garbage.

The premise, the plot, the characters, the prose were all good enough to justify the time spent reading. I was interested enough to keep turning the pages. 
 This book was pretty simplistic in terms of plotting and characterizations. It also seemed generic and formulaic so while I enjoyed it well enough to read it in two sittings in less than 24 hours, I doubt it will stick in my mind long.

I kept turning the pages thinking ""surely I will come to like this eventually, I have to like this at some point right?"" The premise was so awesome, so perfectly in line with what I like to read about, that I just couldn't believe I found it so dreadfully boring. 
 I read lots of books with alternating narrators but Berry totally botched this common literary technique. This was a book with a fatally flawed structure. There are way too many characters who narrate chapters, and the chapters are way too short. All the perspective shifts totally kill narrative momentum and the character development feels so unsatisfying because, in an attempt to do justice to many characters, Berry ends up doing justice to none. Berry cannot write about a large ensemble cast in an interesting way to save her life. All the characters just feel so bland. 
 Because I was never hooked into the glacially paced plot and I never cared about the characters I found the book totally flat and its treatment of what should have been heart wrenching, emotionally intense material didn't move me at all. 
 I feel like Berry was really going for it with this book. I think the setting and the structure show a lot of creativity and ambition, but the execution just did not work for me at all. I get no joy out of panning a book that is trying to be unique and I hate the idea that in some ways I am criticizing an author for trying to do too much, but I just didn't like this book. I tried really hard to like it but I just didn't. I was never engaged, only frustrated that a book I eagerly anticipated reading for months left me totally cold.

Faye is such a great prose writer, and she created well developed characters (Jane has such a great voice as first person narrator and the supporting characters are very interesting as well) and placed them in very compelling settings. 
 The second half of the book, once Jane Steele returns to childhood home as an undercover governess, while still good is not as well paced as the first half. There are places where the book drags and the action/exposition that follows these slow parts seems a bit too hurried. The plot in the second half is really cool, it's just the execution of this plot is a bit flawed because the plot progression happens in quick bursts after periods of inactivity.

Annie did not deserve co-equal status as a protagonist with Lauren. Devoting so much time to her perspective was just a waste since she's a boring character who ends up being totally irrelevant to the resolution of the mystery. Lauren is a really good character more than capable of carrying a book herself and the first half of this book drags because it is overloaded with unnecessary information. 
 In fact, Sissel chooses to solve the whole ""where is Bo?"" plot line and go off in a completely different direction for the conclusion, leaving us with a final act that has little to do with what came before which is jarring in and of its own right and the switch makes Annie's prominence even more surprising and unnecessary.

To be honest, I was also skimming in parts despite my attempts to pay attention because the book was so eye glazingly dull and impenetrably written. The Goblin Emperor has been on my radar since it came out two years ago. I love reading about court intrigue and I was thrilled at the thought of a fantasy novel rooted in the details of governance. I have no problem putting on my political science hat when reading fiction. The plot synopsis sounded awesome to me. 
 I thought the premise of this book had such potential, which is why I never totally abandoned it despite the fact that I never enjoyed it and it never held my attention for more than a few pages at a time. Sadly, reading this is such a chore. There are a million characters with super complex, ridiculous ""fantasy"" names and the language is ridiculously stuffy and formal and flowery. Since Maia is such a naif you have no idea what's going on just like him. Good luck keeping track of who is who and what is what. The enclosed glossary at the back isn't any help. I understand why Addison made these linguistic choices, but they didn't work for me at all as a reader and made this pretty much unbearable. I could never get into the rhythm of this book, and I was always bored and/or frustrated while reading it. 
 This is just such a tedious slog. Had the cast been cut in half and if they had names a reader could actually remember and personalities maybe I would have cared about some of these people. Had the pacing not been so terrible maybe I would have cared about what plot there is. The world building is overly focused on language and clothing to the detriment of anything resembling a real book.

Marra excels at exploring the many ways people deal with adversity in an authentic, moving way. There is a lot heavy material covered here (war, the consequences of environmental degradation, the psychological scars of communism and the false hope of post-Communist Russia) but it is expertly leavened with humor. I laughed out loud reading this book repeatedly, even though it is often very tragic. 
 Marra is a very insightful writer. He can cut to the heart of a complicated emotion or issue with an expertly crafted sentence. His prose is sneakily great. 
 I enjoyed this thoroughly and read it in a day. I was only a little frustrated that these great stories, that created such a complex and compelling world, were not chapters in a truly epic, doorstopper novel. Every time we transitioned from one tale to another I felt a loss (despite how plotlines and characters recur) that I was being forced out of an expertly crafted miniature world before I was ready. Ironically, the only story I did not feel this way about was the title tale, the longest by a significant margin but my least favorite (excepting the short space coda which I wasn't crazy about either and I don't even really count as a story).

Stewart writes with understated wit, relaying historical information and building the relationships between Constance, Norma and Fleurette with a deft hand. However, even though a lot of this book is light hearted in tone, she is also able to tap into Constance's understandable feelings of melancholy about her family's diminishing fortunes, her place as a woman in early 20th century society, and the fact she is (view spoiler)[ secretly ""sister"" Fleurette's mother (hide spoiler)], a fact she has had to conceal for ages that readers learn about through flashbacks. I appreciated how much time Stewart devoted to the family dynamics of the Kopps. Not only did she write a lot of strong scenes between the sisters, but I liked reading their interactions with their brother Francis, his wife Bessie and especially their deceased mother (who we see via flashback). This is a real ensemble piece of a book. I don't think any of the sisters individually are especially interesting or nuanced characters, but taken as a unit the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and they are fun protagonists as a trio. 
 Despite how goodreads classifies this, I wouldn't really consider it a mystery. There's not much tension or suspense to the non-mysterious ""mystery"" at the heart of this book because both the characters and the reader have a pretty good idea of who's doing what and why throughout. The Kopp sisters are menaced by a nefarious silk factory owner named Henry Kaufman after they try to seek restitution after he crashes into their buggy, causing $50 in damages. Kaufman is a shady operator threatens the Kopp sisters with an escalating campaign of intimidation. While fending off his goons with her sisters, Constance is also sucked into a side mystery helping one of Kaufman's hard luck workers, Lucy Blake, retrieve her kidnapped baby. There's never a strong sense of danger in text, even when the sisters must take up arms to defend themselves, nor is there ambiguity about what's going on.

It could have been twice as long as it was without an ounce of filler. Protagonist Georgy Jachmenev is an 82 year old man reflecting back on his life as he faces the impending death of his beloved wife Zoya. Boyne presents a fractured chronology of Georgy's life, cutting between his youth as Russian peasant turned companion of and bodyguard to Alexei Romanov with a series of chapters covering his post-Russian exile life in Paris and London which are presented in reverse chronological order from 1981 to 1918. Through Georgy's eyes we see the stark contrast between the life of the everyday Russian farmer and the obscene opulence of the Imperial Court, the collapse of Tsarist Russia, the horrors endured in London during World War II, and are treated to an analysis of the complex, deeply loving 60+ year marriage between Georgy and Zoya who is (view spoiler)[ quite obviously Anastasia Romanov (hide spoiler)]

It is definitely on the light and fluffy side so if you're expecting serious, heavy historical fiction you'll be disappointed but if you want to enjoy some Napoleonic France era spy hijinks, witty writing, vivid and spirited characters, and romance this book will hit the spot. This book is really quite silly at points but it has a lot of charm. It is like a big dumb puppy in book form.

 Also, the prose is totally artless. The vocabulary and sentence structure seem pitched at around a 4th grade reading level. There is not one well written phrase in this book. It is just as lame stylistically as it is substantively.

I love a good family saga and the four generations of Alters chronicled here are a fascinating bunch of head cases. I loved this book's tone. It balanced its comedic and dramatic elements very well. Mitchell has such a unique, distinctive voice as an author. The three sisters who narrate this book as a singular entity, Lady, Vee, and Delph are complicated, damaged, keenly observant and darkly funny women. 
 I loved how witty this family history/extended suicide note was, how clever and creative it felt. Even though the majority of characters in this book are suicidal and/or suffer horrible tragedy, the gallows humor keeps this book lively. On the one hand it seemed like a kind of outlandish dark fairy tale but on the other hand it also seemed perceptive and authentic, which is hard to pull off. 
 My only criticism is that I didn't care too much for the third act introduction of (view spoiler)[ a random long lost cousin who quickly becomes an important character, deflowers Delph, then narrates the book's last chapter. (hide spoiler)] This inclusion seemed kind of weird and random (and not weird and random in a good way like other parts of this book). It seemed to break the spell of the book by injecting this perspective that was so different than the sisters' very specific viewpoint.

I couldn't concentrate on work. I ate a bag of gummi savers for lunch because I couldn't be bothered to break away from it to get real food. This is one of those types of books. ""A Little Life"" could have so easily collapsed under the weight of its ambitions or lapsed into tawdry melodrama but instead Yanagihara crafts a thoughtful, brilliant, devastating, spectacularly written character study. 
 I feel like nothing I say can fully do this amazing novel justice. Yanagihara is unflinching in her commitment to chronicling the lingering impact of extreme, unspeakable childhood trauma on protagonist Jude's life. Much of the material here is gut wrenching. It will bring tears to your eyes. However, no matter how dark the material, this book never feels exploitative because Jude is such a nuanced, well developed character. Rarely does a character feel as authentic as Jude, despite the extreme unorthodoxy of his life. If I just summarized the plot for you, many elements of it would sound unrealistic (the wealth and success of Jude and his friends, the lack of chronological specificity and historical details in the plot, the particular facts of Jude's abuse). These things should feel contrived but they don't. They feel totally real. 
 There are also beautifully rendered moments of sensitivity, compassion and kindness in this book that offer some respite from all the tragedy. Yanagihara denies the reader the false catharsis of a traditional ""from tragedy to healing"" narrative arc yet she allows Jude moments of power, dignity and happiness, though the crippling self hatred and neurosis from his past is never far away. 
 Yanagihara also does a fantastic job writing relationships. While this is undoubtedly Jude's story, the supporting characters are interesting in relation to each other and in relation to Jude. Watching all these characters grow with each other over the course of decades, seeing their relationships grow and deepen and/or crack and reconstitute themselves was so powerful and affecting. I really feel like I lived beside these people as I read this, as I was swept up in the course of their lives. 
 This is incredibly emotionally intense, heavy reading. For anyone looking for a totally immersive reading experience, this book will challenge, move and astound you.",Mon Jul 13 13:24:23 -0700 2015,Fri Dec 30 19:48:57 -0800 2016,Tue Jul 14 00:00:00 -0700 2015,Mon Jul 13 00:00:00 -0700 2015,3,0

Aside from the sprinkling of pseudo-Russian cultural allusions this seemed like a very standard ""sad overlooked orphan turned chosen one"" story that involves significant time at a magic school, another shop worn fantasy setting. 
 However, as this book went on it impressed me more and more. The book becomes more complex and more tragic, the writing and dialogue more poignant. The characters become more nuanced and their relationships more emotionally affecting.

I was intrigued by the set up of the book but then, just as I was expecting Oyeyemi to really dig into her great concept she dramatically changes the way she chooses to tell her story. The book totally falls off a cliff and never recovers by the halfway point. Bird and Snow, who should be great characters, are totally bland, the storytelling becomes so detached and remote it becomes impossible to care about anyone or anything. The pages of letters are lazy device. 
 The ending is so awful and ludicrous that if I haven't already disengaged from the book I would have been angry. Instead I had a chuckle at the extreme incompetence of this totally bizarre conclusion.

In this volume General Mulaghesh has to investigate the disappearance of a missing agent working in the wrecked and mostly waterlogged warrior state of Voortyashtan. In her investigations she uncovers a larger, potentially apocalyptic threat. As I have come to expect from Bennett this book featured a cleverly byzantine plot, awesome mythology, great prose and fascinating, morally complicated characters. 
 Bennett does such a good job of making this world feel as complex as our own. His fantasy world is very creative and alien in many ways, yet there is an underlying authenticity to how he writes about international relations between countries of different socio-economic statuses, political power struggles, the physical and psychological toll of war, how nations collectively reckon with their past, and the various social and psychological needs filled by religious faith among other things.

The Blind Assassin is a structurally complicated (read: unnecessarily gimmicky) work that sets out to tell three eventually converging stories. These three parts of the narrative vary dramatically in quality. 
 Part One: Flashbacks to protagonist Iris's early life, written in memoir form from the perspective of Iris as an old, justifiably embittered women. These chapters are uniformly excellent. 
 Part Two: Elderly Iris in the present reflecting on her current life. Good but repetitive (this section can be summarized as ""get off my lawn"" written in more highfalutin prose). 
 Part Three: The novel within a novel ""The Blind Assassin"" (view spoiler)[ supposedly (hide spoiler)] written by Iris's doomed sister Laura. This is tedious, almost incomprehensible garbage. A terrible, horrible, no good, very bad writing experiment that should have been jettisoned by the editor before publication. You can skip these chapters without missing a beat, and I would encourage anyone who reads this book to do so. 
 There are also faux newspaper articles sprinkled throughout the text to provide some exposition. 
 There was enough that worked about this book that I am happy I read it, but the parts that don't work are really terrible. Iris's story without the ""Blind Assassin"" segments is more than strong enough to carry a book without the obnoxious, annoying and unnecessary book within a book.

This is riveting, disturbing, thought provoking, insightful, brilliant writing. I was impressed by how sophisticated this book was. It works not only as a harrowing chronicle of the physical and mental degradation of the teen boys undergoing the Long Walk but also as a fantastic anti-war (specifically anti-Vietnam) parable. It is also a prescient critique of reality TV culture. The characters are so rich as individuals and King does a great job sketching their complicated relationships with each other over the course of their ordeal. I thought King did a great job exploring how extreme adversity can bring out so many different aspects of a man's personality: bravado, anger, self destructiveness, pity, empathy, humor as coping mechanism, altruism, selfishness, the will to die and the will to live, numbness and extreme emotional volatility.

This was one epic novel covering three generations of a dysfunctional family and the parade of traumas visited upon them. I really liked this book. Lamb does a great job writing complex characters with complicated relationships with each other. Even the most damaged, vile seeming people have moments where they become somewhat sympathetic due to how well Lamb crafts them psychologically and how much time he devotes to exploring their lives. 
 Given how many characters and plot points Lamb juggles, this is an admirably well constructed book. The many flashbacks/time jumps never feel awkward or arbitrary.

 There was so much interesting information about the politics of Elendel in the last volume, I really missed that this time around. I feel like the other Mistborn books all have a lot more going on then what is essentially a quest for magical artifact/heist narrative.

 Minnow Bly is arrested and sent to juvenile detention center after severely beating a man.

The book alternates between Minnow's day to day life in juvie with flashbacks to her life as part of this cult, counting down to the night the Prophet was killed and the Community burned. I think Oakes did a great job fleshing out the mythology of the cult and exploring how the Prophet wielded his power. I liked learning about the rituals and holy texts and beliefs of the Kevinians. Minnow is forced to endure poverty and neglect and abuse culminating in the loss of her hands when she dares to defy the Prophet. Her one joy is her clandestine relationship with a boy named Jude who lives in the woods but not as part of the compound.

 This is a coming of age/journey of self discovery story split into three parts.

 I liked this book a lot. It was highly entertaining and it felt fresh and original. The flashback chapters provided great background information and character development. I really liked how Hawkins treated the concept of godhood; both how he chronicles the acquisition of power and how living with such power would warp a person emotionally, mentally and (in some cases) physically. There isn't much of a cohesive plot until the last third of the book but the world building and the characters are interesting enough that the book never drags.

Annith, like Ismae and Sybella before her, was an interesting protagonist with a fascinating backstory. I also enjoyed the theological orientation of this installment. 
 However, also like book two, I found the plot sluggish. It takes a long time to get going and the final resolution to Duchess's plot relies heavily on a deus ex machina I found totally underwhelming. I feel like the first book had such a rich, complex plot where these last two volumes had enough plot for one book stretched out over two.

 I think this book was undone by its structure. It alternates between present day interludes with the four grown siblings, narrated in the first person, and a seemingly arbitrary grab bag of flashbacks to their childhoods/young adulthoods narrated in the third person. The chapters each sibling narrates are a mixed bag: two of them are interesting and two of them are bland because the characters are so underdeveloped. The flashbacks are a similarly mixed bag. Having 10-11 chapters that barely connected to each other was not the way to tell this story. It badly hampered character development and in a book like this which is supposed to be a character study first and foremost and where there is basically no plot that proved to be a fatal flaw. 
 This book lacked necessary connective tissue. With the possible exception of James, none of the characters have arcs. We don't see them grow and develop and change as Packer wants us to. This book just reads like a random series of vignettes that range from dull to intriguing but frustrating (because they end just when they're gaining momentum). I did not get the level of insight into the members of this family as individuals or as a unit that I wanted. 
 Disappointingly shallow. A character study without an adequate roster of interesting characters.",Fri Mar 06 20:58:14 -0800 2015,Sun Apr 19 08:53:21 -0700 2015,Sun Apr 19 08:53:21 -0700 2015,Fri Apr 17 00:00:00 -0700 2015,0,0

I got a good read on Vanessa and Virginia as individuals and their relationship was well developed, but everything else seemed a little undercooked. The large cast of characters seem pretty busy gallivanting about having parties, travelling, catching old timey illnesses and falling into and out of bed with each other arbitrarily, but our understanding of them remains superficial since we just check in with them via letters/telegrams or read brief summaries presented by Vanessa. 
 As a recounting of a complex sibling relationship this book is quite interesting and successful. It is pleasantly written and fun to read. It does not do a great job however when it tries to expand its focus beyond the Stephen sisters to discuss the adventures of the Bloomsbury Group more generally. Also, none of these people come off as very intellectual at all.

The writing was beautiful, the characters were interesting and their lives were endlessly compelling. The first half of this book, which chronicles the part of Hildegard von Bingen's life where she was imprisoned as an anchorite nun, is fascinating and horrifying. With a small cast of characters and a limited setting Sharratt manages to create a tense, harrowing, emotionally powerful and complex narrative. The second half of the book, which covers Hildegard's life as she tries to establish a home for herself and her fellow nuns, her writing and the response to her religious visions, is just as great. Hildegard is a great protagonist and all the supporting characters are well developed as well. Even the villainous characters were nuanced and interesting. 
 I also loved how well the author integrated historical information into the story without it ever seeming awkward. Sharratt managed to seamlessly include a lot of smart commentary on the cultural mores of the time. At around 275 pages this is not a long book but it is very rich.

The plot, which is supposed to be oh so wacky and satirical, is badly undercooked. It reads like a skeleton draft or an outline, not a fleshed out concept. Since the plot is so underdeveloped everything that happens feels stupidly far fetched. I wouldn't mind an unrealistic plot in a book like this as long as the author puts some effort into explaining/justifying why the crazy things occur. That doesn't happen here.

I look at it as a subversion of the traditional ""chosen one"" hero's journey fantasy arc. In Empress we follow a villain's journey basically, in a world where individualism and free will are totally de-emphasized. 
 What I liked most about this book was how truly alien it was. The all encompassing religious belief system, the highly formalized and highly repetitious dialogue, the lack of basic human decency exercised by almost every character, and the bizarre mix of egomania and self effacement that characterizes this warrior society. This is a profoundly different world where cruelty and slavish devotion to an unseen deity govern every action. Characters have personal ambitions but they must be sublimated to ""the god"" and everyone lacks the basic self awareness to determine what they want as opposed to what ""the god"" wants. 
 Miller created a very immersive world here, filled with fascinating (albeit gruesome) customs. She handles world building well, avoiding the trap of clumsy over exposition while still communicating vital information. I was never frustrated by a lack of understanding of this world even though Miller deliberately leaves a few things ambiguous.

 I was really into this book at first. I was intrigued by both conflicts McEwan presents: the marital conflict between Fiona and Jack and the conflict over whether 17 year old Jehovah's Witness Adam should be legally compelled to receive life changing blood transfusions to treat his leukemia. 
 This book just totally petered out for me after a very strong set up. The two stories never intersect well and none of the characters are sufficiently well developed. The second half of Adam's story in particular was so truncated that it just seemed preposterous. He and his behavior felt inauthentic. He is not the only character whose motivations seem to vary dramatically at random. Nor did I really understand Fiona and Jack's marriage very well by the end. 
 There is barely a short story's worth of plot here so the book succeeds or fails on the strength of its characterizations. Unfortunately the characters are undercooked. I never got into these characters' heads. 
 This book was ultimately way too short and too shallow to do justice to its material.

 Unfortunately for all the wit and stylistic skill Rowell demonstrates here I found the substance of this book incredibly frustrating. This portrait of a marriage didn't work for me for a few reasons. The initial conflict frankly doesn't seem like much of a conflict at all. Georgie is presented with a once in a lifetime job opportunity that would necessitate working through a family Christmas. Neal is so offended by this he takes their children to his parents house and through his non-communication signals he thinks their marriage is in trouble. This is a pretty weak issue to present as a potentially marriage ending calamity. 
 For all the time spent chronicling their courtship from their first college meeting to the present I never really bought Georgie or Neal as a couple and I certainly didn't root for them to stay together. I never got what they saw in each other, particularly what Georgie saw in Neal. 
 Neal is presented as a perpetually disgruntled jerk who lashes out at his wife due to his own inadequacies. Neal resents Georgie's focus on her career and how her career forces him to live in California yet he has no direction or ambition himself. He is just generically unhappy yet unwilling to actually do the work of cultivating his own interests or developing himself as a person. Rowell also repeatedly discusses how Neal almost never laughs or smiles which is just weird and creepy. 
 Neal comes off so poorly in part because we don't get half the insight into him that we get into Georgie. Had the reader been granted the same degree of insight into his thoughts and feelings maybe his actions would have been more understandable and justifiable. We actually see very little of modern Neal and Georgie interacting with each other. There are vague references to fights/problems but we are told not shown the state of their marriage in 2013. We are told Neal is a fantastic father, which would have been another way to potentially humanize his character, but again we don't really see that in action. 
 As the book went on and Georgie got more and more desperate to mend her marriage, and more and more self-flagellating about her faults and how bad a wife she was I became increasingly uncomfortable as a reader because I didn't appreciate the book's suggestion that only Georgie is at fault for the nebulously defined marriage issues. Since 2013 Neal is giving Georgie the cold shoulder he is offscreen for a lot of the book so you never get into his headspace like you get into Georgie's. 
 The whole point of the book seems to be that Neal is right and Georgie is wrong and how dare she have a close male friend and a demanding career she is passionate about (that allows Neal to be a stay at home dad). Neal is never made to answer for his glaring faults as a husband (he is a mean, whiny passive aggressive sad sack who undeservedly resents his wife for her professional success) whereas Georgie spends a good part of the book raking herself over the coals for working long hours. Neal never displays self criticism or self reflection. I feel like my perception of Neal and Georgie as characters and their marriage is very different from the one Rowell wanted me to have. 
 I haven't discussed the fantastical element of the plot: modern day Georgie's telephone conversations with 1998 Neal. Rowell isn't overly concerned with the Sci-Fi/fantasy elements of the plot. The phone calls to the past are a device to provide exposition about Neal and Georgie's relationship and to trigger in Georgie various levels of angst about and love towards Neal. I thought the use of the phone calls to the past was a good plot device if you accept that Rowell is using it as a tool to introduce relevant plot and character information rather than a fully fleshed out concept in and of itself. 
 For all my many problems with this book there were some passages that blew me away with how well written they were. I could see so much potential in Rowell's writing. It is just unfortunate that this didn't really work for me on the whole.",Thu Sep 04 19:01:35 -0700 2014,Fri Sep 05 02:34:39 -0700 2014,Fri Sep 05 02:34:39 -0700 2014,Thu Sep 04 00:00:00 -0700 2014,0,0

I was interested and impressed by many of the things in this book. I liked the premise, the mythology, the pacing, and I found the plot pretty consistently involving. However I also spent some time rolling my eyes at the pedestrian prose, all the stupid asides about clothes, make up and cars, everything having to do with generic yet improbable super jerk Jericho Barrons.

The high concept time travel plot is of secondary importance to Greta's ruminations about life, love and grief as she struggles to deal with the loss of her twin brother and the demise of her long term relationship. It is hard to write so extensively about feelings without seeming trite or dull or manipulative but Greer is up to the task. This is a really beautifully written book. His imagery is great and he writes internal monologue well. I read this mostly in one sitting, captivated by Greta's experiences in 1918, 1941 and 1985. 
 Each time period is used to explore a different dimension of Greta's life as well as display alternative versions of her relationships with her brother, boyfriend (who is her husband in 1918 and 1941) and aunt. 
 The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I felt it was a bit of a missed opportunity not ever meeting either of the other two Gretas.

I was initially put off by how spare Vonnegut's prose was (I generally don't care for writing this stripped down) and since the book structurally mirrors the fragmented mind of its protagonist Billy Pilgrim it took me some time to get into the rhythm of the story. Once I acclimated to this book stylistically though I found it to be really, really great. 
 This book manages to say so much within its short page span. The droll, detached, fatalistic, plain spoken way Vonnegut communicates is devastating at times. There is this fantastic line in the book about how war had made everyone too listless and sick to be characters that conveys more tragedy in one sentence than I have seen other books convey in 500 pages of text. Vonnegut refuses to provide the easy satisfaction of heroes and villains, and he continually emphasizes the lack of individual control any person has over the course of their life.

 Even though this book is very exposition heavy there were certain things that either didn't work for me or weren't clear enough to me from a world building perspective. I also had some pacing/plot momentum problems and quibbles with the (lack of) development of the supporting characters.

This book is excellent from top to bottom. Hill jumps right into the premise with zero preamble and the first part of the book has a lot of great dark comedy as Ig compels twisted confessions out of people with his newly sprouted devil's horns. Over the course of narrative Hill uses flashbacks and multiple perspectives well to flesh out the characters and plot. Certain elements of the plot may initially seem a little far fetched but Hill creates a great, grounded bedrock for them in the relationship between Ig and Merrin.

Her prose is highly stylized and a bit artificial which might be off putting to some but I just adore it. I also love how well Faye has constructed the historical milieu of 1840's New York. Two books in and this series has a nice roster of supporting characters and a lot going on plotwise. 
 However, I did like this installment less than book one. I found Timothy Wilde bizarrely naive and hysterical in this second outing. His characterization didn't seem to jibe with how he was portrayed in book one, or how a man with his life experiences would behave. There was also one element to the mystery, which I won't reveal here, that I just didn't believe and it was pretty critical to the plot. Still a good read though.

Despite some snappy writing I found it gimmicky and inauthentic at first. As it went on I liked it more though. Bartholemew is a good narrator and I did eventually become emotionally invested in him. I am glad I read it although the book is not very substantial. One important supporting character is characterized solely through ridiculously excessive swearing, which got tedious quickly. A quick and at times clever, entertaining read that could have used more meat on the bone in terms of plot/characterization.

Gabaldon created a solid pair of protagonists who are individually interesting and have strong romantic chemistry, stylistically her writing is very pleasing to read, there are some fascinating plot developments.

I kind of resent the pretty writing actually because without it I might have just abandoned this narrative train wreck instead of trudging through it. 
 The protagonist Morgana is mute from trauma. This is a contrivance that fails in several ways. The romance between Morgana and blandly perfect Cai is super dull and unconvincing because of the lack of communication between them. I never got a good sense of what Cai saw in Morgana and Cai isn't well developed enough to be a proper romantic lead. 
 Even more frustratingly I feel like Morgana's muteness was a gimmick included to add complications to what is ultimately a painfully simplistic plot. If Morgana could talk this would be a twenty page short story. The sections of the book relayed in first person from Morgana's perspective read nothing like how you would expect a person so emotionally disturbed as to be rendered mute for years and years to be. Nothing about Morgana felt authentic. 
 The villains are also awful one dimensional mustache twirlers who are melodramatic and stupid in the way cartoon villains are. None of the characterizations are complex here. Everything about this book is very flat and juvenile. 
 This paper thin plot and these anemic characters are not rich enough to sustain a novel. Don't be suckered in by the stylistic skill shown by the author like I did. This author's first book, the Witch's Daughter, is very good however. Read that instead if this author intrigues you.",Mon Jun 16 21:45:00 -0700 2014,Thu Jun 19 14:57:08 -0700 2014,Thu Jun 19 14:57:08 -0700 2014,Tue Jun 17 00:00:00 -0700 2014,0,0

 Brady is a great antagonist (the chapters from his perspective are the best parts of the book) but Hodges is a bit bland/underdeveloped as a protagonist and some of his choices don't make a ton of sense. The depiction of Hodge's relationships with Janey, Jerome and Holly seesawed between well drawn camaraderie and cringe worthy inauthenticity depending on the scene.

The writing is snidely clever and has a good amount of observational detail. The three protagonists are well developed characters, their arcs are plausible and satisfying. This book is hard to put down. 
 However I had problems with the structure and pacing of the novel. The mystery of the letter was highly predictable, and I am not one prone to or particularly successful at guessing plot developments before they occur, so I became very frustrated with how drawn out the whole thing was and how long we had to wait to get the letter read. This book crossed the line from teasing suspense to highly frustrating. 
 At the end of the day this is a pretty simple story told in a convoluted, gimmicky way. One of the three main stories, that of Tess, never has more than a tertiary connection to the titular husband's secret and resulting fallout so while it wasn't bad I am left wondering why it was included and given such narrative prominence. The flashbacks and digressions about the Berlin Wall don't add much to the story either. Finally, I didn't care for the epilogue.

There are a few things that are very common in books with romantic subplots that drive me crazy: the ""we fight all the time and treat each other like crap because we really love each other"" trope, contrived obstacles that can be resolved through five seconds of honest communication, love at first sight being treated as legitimate etc etc. 
 This book doesn't make the romance the sole or even primary driver of the plot but it nonetheless develops the relationship between bookish Emma and her paramour well. I was consistently engaged by the mystery plot, which isn't shockingly original but is still fun to read, enjoyed this historical setting and was intrigued by the wealthy, eccentric Weston family.

 This book mashes up tropes from plague/pandemic novels and vampire stories. There are a few novel aspects to its mythology wedded to the typical tropes of both genres.

Jack has lived his whole life in one room: a shed where his mother has been imprisoned for 7 years a la Elisabeth Fritzl or Jaycee Dugard.

I think Donoghue is very successful at using this naive character as the point of entry for this harrowing story. Despite Jack's innocence this book is deeply creepy and through the power of insinuation still communicates some of the unimaginable horror that Ma experienced. The layering of Jack's vision of Room with what we as adults know about it deftly handled. Jack's perspective on the wider world was similarly intriguing. 
 There are a few moments where I as a reader longed for more insight into Ma's thoughts/feelings especially after (view spoiler)[ Jack and Ma escape capitivity (hide spoiler)] but I realize this wouldn't have been possible without compromising the unique narrative voice of Jack.

There is an entertaining story buried in this latest volume of the Dark Tower series but it is a thin one that King overwrites to the point where you just want to book to end long before it does. 
 To help you understand where I am coming from I must confess that I approached this book with trepidation. Roland is by far my least favorite character in the ka tet, I don't like Westerns as a rule and I wasn't crazy about the first volume of the Dark Tower series which is similarly Roland focused. 
 After a strong conclusion to the cliffhanger ending of book three most of this book is a flashback which chronicles Roland's doomed affair with Susan Delgado. I liked this story a lot initially. I really gravitated to Susan Delgado as a character. However this storyline goes on for way, way, way too long and just becomes crushingly tedious. Had this flashback been a tight 200 pages I don't think it would have suffered at all narratively. It is ridiculously bloated in its 400+ pages form. 
 This book offers way too little in the way of plot progression and acts as a real momentum killer after the very strong second and third volumes. If Stephen King wanted to write a book that is primarily a digression from the overarching plot he should have seriously trimmed the fat here and made the book significantly shorter. You can't make your reader slog through 700 pages and offer as little as King ultimately offers here plot or character wise.",Sat Mar 22 08:39:35 -0700 2014,Thu Apr 03 18:01:39 -0700 2014,Thu Apr 03 17:48:14 -0700 2014,Sat Mar 22 00:00:00 -0700 2014,0,0

 1) the premise is awesome: time traveling serial killer tracks down ""shining girls"" and kills them. He is able to evade justice through his time travel, which is facilitated by a malevolent magical house that compels him to kill. One of his intended victims survives his attack and tries to hunt him down. 
 2) the profiles of the shining girls are fantastic. Beukes communicates so much about these women in only a few pages. I keenly felt the pain of their loss and feel like I got a lot of insight into the women and the times in which they lived. 
 3) This is pretty well written (minus the overreliance on super short chapters which was a bit choppy and annoying) and definitely a page turner 
 4) Kirby is a potentially great protagonist though her full potential as a character is unrealized because... 
 Now to discuss the book's weaknesses 
 1) My biggest problem with this book was how it botched the Kirby searches for her attacker plotline. Beukes short shifts the investigative process to devote way too much narrative attention to Kirby's investigative partner/love interest Dan, a much older former homicide reporter who now writes about sports. Dan is a dull, pedestrian character who has no chemistry with Kirby and the book wastes a ton of time writing about Dan and developing his relationship with Kirby to the detriment of the other, more interesting elements of the plot. I definitely want to read on and on about some baseball reporter whining about his divorce and making lame wisecracks instead of all the other cool characters in this book :: eye roll:: 
 Even the time actually devoted to chronicling Kirby's investigation is underwhelming. 
 2) This book provides doesn't offer much in the way of explanation of its premise. You're not going to learn much about how time travel works here, why the ""shining girls"" are so shiny and enticing, you're not going to get much information about the house and Harper is a two dimensional character driven solely by his animal drives. I guess this can be looked at as a nice puncturing of the cliche of the super intelligent, cultured serial killer but I would have liked more information about both how the supernatural aspects of the plot worked and what made Harper tick. 
 Even though this book has some flaws/problems I would recommend it. It's a worthwhile read even if it squanders some of its potential.",Tue Mar 11 22:02:48 -0700 2014,Thu Apr 03 19:07:55 -0700 2014,Fri Mar 14 00:00:00 -0700 2014,Wed Mar 12 00:00:00 -0700 2014,0,0

The writing style is plain and unimpressive, the plot and characterizations bland. Three characters (Jeff, his wife Claire, and Jeff's co-worker and secret confidant Tish) narrate alternating chapters in the first person and their voices and personalities seem identical. There is no attempt made to imbue any of these three characters with unique traits, thoughts or feelings. The book deals with heavy topics such as death (Jeff is killed in a car accident by the end of chapter one) and mourning, infidelity, generalized dissatisfaction with life, and handles them in a predictable fashion without contributing much in the way of insight. 
 This was a quick, easy read and I had some interest in seeing how everything would turn out but at the end of the day this book is nondescript and forgettable.

Through the investigation of a series of brutal child murders we learn about the formation of the Copper Stars, the city's first police department, tensions between Irish immigrants and nativists, and Democratic machine politics among other things.

I enjoyed the first two volumes with some reservations/nitpicks but this final tale definitely kicks it up a notch in terms of skill and intensity. I enjoyed how thoroughly this book delved into the thoughts and motivations of both Valerian and Gavin. These two characters were at their best here. There were times where I found Valerian kind of bland/underdeveloped as a character in the first two installments but here I think Campbell totally nails her characterization. Valerian begins the novel with a new identity and an understandably guarded attitude. As she acclimates to college life watching her fragile hope give way to malaise, self loathing and fatalism was tragic. As outrageous as some of the events of this book are, its treatment of the psychological dynamics of abuse and depression is well grounded. The secondary characters were also strong here. I also enjoyed the asides about psychology (a subject I always wish I studied more). 
 Additionally this was very well written stylistically. I never had a problem with the prose in any of these three books but it is especially good here. 
 Gavin's super villain powers definitely require some suspension of disbelief (less here though than in book 2) but provided you are able to cut the book a little slack in this regard it is a very satisfying story. The third act has (view spoiler)[ an unnecessary second villain who is the brother of Charlie from book two that I could have done without, but it's not a big problem (hide spoiler)] Also, I think this is a nice corrective to all the books that paint controlling/abusive/stalker behavior as romantic.",Wed Feb 26 16:47:40 -0800 2014,Sat Mar 01 08:54:29 -0800 2014,Sat Mar 01 13:35:37 -0800 2014,Wed Feb 26 00:00:00 -0800 2014,1,1

At first I found it a pleasant read but below the very high standards set by the other three Tropper novels I've read. There were things that seemed a little generic and cliched about some of the initial characterizations and some of the humor felt a bit stale (mostly the ""wacky/dirty old man"" stuff with Norm) despite Tropper's characteristically great prose. 
 However as I read I realized how emotionally powerful I found the various plotlines. Protagonist Zack is dealing with an attraction to his best friend's widow despite his engagement to a seemingly perfect woman, the reappearance of his eccentric, absentee father Norm, his grief over his friend's death, occupational dissatisfaction and potential medical issues all within a very short period of time. 
 So as I read I became steadily more engaged by these characters and the finely developed relationships between them. The romantic, platonic and familial relationships were all pretty well drawn. Tropper's writing is often wry and/or sarcastic but he is not afraid of earnestly addressing emotional issues. Tropper is very good at balancing humor and sentiment. 
 The ending is very gratifying. In particular I really liked how Tropper deals with the issue of parental abandonment and the psychology of a parent like Norm. Under the spoiler tag I am going to discuss my feelings about this aspect of the plot in more detail, covering events through the end of the book. (view spoiler)[ I loved how Norm went unredeemed as a character. I was dreading an ending where Norm is reconciled to his family despite his incredibly despicable behavior so I was thrilled that the book ends with Norm ditching everyone again after abandoning a very young son he's kept secret from the family. This worked so well for me for a few reasons. First, it felt authentic. Men like Norm don't change. Norm was a man capable of providing love and affection in short bursts but too stunted and selfish to be a real father. Furthermore, he could never really makes amends for abandoning his family. Secondly, I was worried Tropper would want me to like Norm by the end of the book and I never warmed to him as a character at all so the ending, in addition to being powerful and realistic also reassured me that I had been interpreting the character in line with the author's intentions.

It covers three very interesting historical periods (a bubonic plague outbreak in 1627, Jack the Ripper's rampage, and latter WWI in addition to the sections set in the present) and it is beautifully written. The style is just gorgeous and the author supplies the perfect amount of historical information. I loved all the information on old time medicine. 
 I was planning on giving this book 5 stars for awhile, I was that impressed by it, but it does have some flaws that keep it from reaching that level. The through line that connects the three historical vignettes and the present is the pursuit of protagonist Bess by the man who initiated her into witchcraft, the wicked Gideon. Gideon is underdeveloped as a character, as is Bess's relationship to him. This makes the conclusion underwhelming. 
 Thankfully this book has enough going for it that I can still strongly recommend it despite this problem. I look forward to reading more from this author.",Wed Feb 19 17:04:49 -0800 2014,Mon Feb 24 17:42:04 -0800 2014,Mon Feb 24 17:42:04 -0800 2014,Wed Feb 19 00:00:00 -0800 2014,0,0

Days of Blood and Starlight is quite different from book one. This book is far more epic in scope, and decidedly darker. It is drenched in the horrors of war and presents a heart breaking, sophisticated and intense reckoning of the physical and psychological toll warfare takes on individuals and societies. It is a book with few clear heroes and villains and oodles of morally gray characters navigating impossible situations. 
 Everything about this book worked for me.

Green could have written a witty, fascinating book about the struggles of being a fading child prodigy. I found his internal monologue (as well as the anagrams and footnotes) at times very involving. 
 Which just makes the actual novel even more frustrating. Green strands this character in a plot that is alternately contrived and dull. The supporting characters are similarly annoying (Hassan) or boring (Lindsey and the other denizens of Gutshot Tennessee). Colin has no friendship or romantic chemistry with any of the other characters here. I was either bored or annoyed every time Colin interacted with someone. I found the plot very boring and the Katherines' theorem a cute idea that far overstayed its welcome. 
 This book is also a total wit fail. It was rarely funny or clever like it wanted to be. As much as I wanted to get invested in Colin, nothing about this plot worked for me. Green also used extreme word repetition in a way that drove me up the wall. I never need to see the words fug/fugging, kafir, spitzpinkler, and dingleberry ever again. The jokes were just dumb and crude. 
 As I mentioned, I saw so much potential in this book, and I am fond of the author both as a writer and as a celebrity personality, but this just didn't click for me at all.

It was competently written stylistically and I was satisfied with the major plot developments but I also found it very slowly paced and boring. I feel like it didn't till new ground for too much of its page span. I didn't learn new things about the characters or the silos and the plot just inched along. The first half was very slow going and it only picked up marginally from there. There were some mildly interesting side stories floating around on the margins of the main Juliette and Donald arcs but nothing that riveted me like Wool and Shift. 
 So ultimately I found this a chore to get through. I pressed on because I wanted closure. If this volume had been shorter overall, and paced better so the action wasn't just all bunched up at the end I would have found it much more engaging read. 
 There is nothing here that retroactively tarnishes my enjoyment of Wool and Shift. As I mentioned I am actually pretty happy with how everything turned out, I just found the journey there tedious.

Suffice it to say this book has a perfectly rendered pair of protagonists, who are at various times both epic and petty in their villainy, tons of witty and sharp observational writing, lots of fun plot twists and unusually vivid and well drawn supporting characters. All the craziness of the plot is undergirded by the bizarre psychological plausibility of Nick and Amy and their relationship. 
 I loved how this story was told too (intercutting first person narration). Often times I feel like books written in the first person suffer from anemic characterization of the non-narrator(s) but this is blessedly not the case here. The way the story is told really complements its thematic purpose. Loved the way the author handled potential unreliable narrator issues inherent in first person novels and the fact that the main characters are writers adds a lot of layer and nuance to how they tell their stories.

Rather, Lukyanenko uses a standard fantasy trope (the battle between the forces of light and darkness) to ruminate on the very nature of good and evil, free will vs. destiny, how to balance the rights of the individual with the rights of the community, and the desirability of status quo maintenance vs. revolutionary change. There's a lot of philosophizing on the part of protagonist Anton and the other members of the Night Watch which proved thought provoking. 
 Despite their simplistic titles, both The Night Watch and the Day Watch, working to enforce a non-aggression treaty between the light and the dark respectively, are both very morally gray institutions. So the forces of Light decry the use of power for personal gain and work to protect individuals from the malicious influence of dark magicians. Yet, in their fantastically misguided utopian zeal the Light also birthed (view spoiler)[Communism and Fascism/Nazism, and are thus responsible for an immense amount of human suffering and death. (hide spoiler)] Agents of both the light and dark watch have nuanced motivations, and neither organization has a wholly positive or negative influence on the world. 
 This book simultaneously felt very grounded and authentic yet highly creative. The light and the dark have complicated bureaucracies that have constructed a complex seven degree classification scheme to measure light and dark magic which is regulated in a strict quid pro quo fashion. Any time a light magician wants to use some good (i.e. selfless) magic, it must be balanced by an equal degree of dark magic. Creatures like vampires are licensed and periodically given licenses to kill humans selected randomly, otherwise they must confine themselves to animal or donor blood. This book mixed the magical and the mundane very well. I also liked how the author could still inject wry humor into the dark subject matter. 
 There were a few important plot/character development moments that I thought were glossed over too quickly and not given enough time and explanation by the author. I also wasn't keen on the occasional interjection of song lyrics into the text.

I think this was an emotionally and psychologically plausible account of how two people with the personalities and traumatic life experiences of Tatiana and Alexander would live together. 
 I didn't spend much time swooning over this coupling because a lot of the time Tatiana is a doormat and Alexander is controlling and occasionally flat out abusive. These elements were present in their relationship from book one, but they are exacerbated here. So if the goal of the book is to have me transported by the beauty of the protagonists' love then it doesn't really work because Tatiana and Alexander are often dysfunctional. 
 However, despite the fact that there relationship was hardly ideal, I never stopped believing it. I could always understand why these people were drawn to each other and why they behaved in the ways they did. I was emotionally attached to them and I liked how the author developed them no matter how much their actual behavior might have bothered me at times. Their behavior always seemed authentic and grounded in their experiences (with the notable exception of their impossible physical dimensions and Olympiad sexcapades). I believed that these two could only be happy with each other, for good or for ill. 
 Narratively the author takes an ""everything and the kitchen sink"" approach to covering over 50 years of Tatiana and Alexander's marriage.

This is not a book for everyone: it is narrated in first person by a mercenary sexual predator named Celeste who becomes an eighth grade teacher solely to have sex with fourteen year old boys. Much of the narrative is dedicated to Celeste narrating her fantasies and gleefully recounting the statutory rapes she regularly commits. It is very sexually explicit in a way that can be unsettling given the subject matter. 
 It is also wickedly clever and perversely perceptive. Stylistically this book is a great success, with some of the most creative similes and descriptive language I have ever read. The character development is similarly vivid though almost every character is ugly and broken in some way. Celeste is totally loathsome but nonetheless a compelling protagonist. She is a shrewd and self aware monster, never deluding herself or the audience about her proclivities. This book does a good job of explaining without justifying who Celeste is and why she is who she is without hammering the audience over the head with easy explanations. 
 I think one of the primary goals of this book is to attack the double standard present in how society evaluates adult women who prey on teenage boys vs. adult men with teen girl victims. Celeste's predation is also linked to a general veneration of youth and the potent power of physical attractiveness and the author teases these points out well.

This story is just amazing. Ozeki does so many things so well here. Nao's writing manages to be witty and clever while also deeply and earnestly emotional when appropriate. Her voice is somehow authentically teenaged sounding while still communicating mature insights. This book is also quite educational in a way that never feels belabored. 
 The rest of the book is narrated from the perspective of Ruth, an older Canadian author who discovers Nao's diary and reads through it while trying to figure out Nao's ultimate fate. Unfortunately the Ruth sections of this book are mostly dull, momentum killing rubbish.

 Written in oral history style, this a a true panorama with a large cast of characters that surveys how dozens of countries reacted to a multi-stage zombie infestation. Even from the vantage point of survivors reflecting back on personal experience, most of these vignettes are thrilling and moving. You'll read about large scale migrations north as survivors seek the comfort of freezing weather, dramatic military engagements, the breakdown of government and civil society as vigilante violence, illness and suicides ravage survivors, the secrets of the countries that weathered the apocalypse well (democracy is not necessary helpful to zombie fighting), and lots of other practical details. This is an ambitious and impressive work with some smart geopolitical and psychological commentary. The fates of many countries are discussed, with particularly memorable discussions of America, Canada, China, Russia, South Africa, Israel, Cuba, Japan, and North Korea. 
 Minor nitpicks: I left this book without a clear sense of the timeline (i.e. when the Zombie War began and ended, how long each stage was) and how far after the conclusion of large scale hostilities World War Z takes place. There are parts that make it seem like it takes place many years in the future, but the presence of interview subjects who lived through World War II means that it can't be that far ahead. Also, while I understand its inclusion, there were a few points where the high level of detail about military equipment/maneuvers made my eyes glaze over.",Fri Dec 06 17:30:33 -0800 2013,Tue Dec 10 08:26:38 -0800 2013,Tue Dec 10 08:26:38 -0800 2013,Fri Dec 06 00:00:00 -0800 2013,0,0

Judging this relatively, Sycamore Row is an improvement over Grisham's last horrid book but well below the standard set by A Time to Kill. This is ultimately kind of blah. It is a surprisingly slow read: the stakes never feel particularly high despite the large sums of the money involved. The pace of the story telling is very slow in the first half, with an overabundance of unnecessary detail and little plot progression. The second half picks up and becomes at least mildly entertaining if not thrilling or suspenseful. The ending is predictable and overly tidy.

 Adichie writes great prose and I liked the first half of this book. The author has a keen eye for using small, mundane details to reveal deeper truths about people and situations. At least initially, this book felt insightful and authentic and I was really into it. 
 Eventually though this book just wore me out and squandered much of its sizable potential. It doesn't have much of a plot and the characters don't change or have narrative arcs. Potential characters and plots are abruptly introduced and just as abruptly dropped in a slipshod way. Characters just stand around and have endless conversations about race and politics that are sometimes well written (when they are not stilted and contrived), often accurate but not as groundbreaking or original as the author seems to think they are. If this book had been much shorter I wouldn't have minded this narrative aimlessness and lack of character development but I expect more from a book that is almost 500 pages long. Any good points were just beaten into the ground long before the book ended. 
 Frankly I also found the protagonist Ifemelu pretty insufferable too as the book wore on. She is a self righteous hypocritical scold who sneers and whines her way through a life of cushy jobs, doting boyfriends and financial stability. At times having such a judgmental protagonist works because we the audience get the benefit of the extremely critical, analytical eye that Ifemelu directs towards everyone (but never herself of course) but this too proves wearying as the book progresses. 
 I don't have a problem with unsympathetic characters per se. I have loved books about people far more despicable than the obnoxious Ifemulu. However there were several things that worked against the character development here. First, Ifemulu is a totally static character. Her perspective never changes despite what happens to her. Secondly she has a pretty easy life so the constant resentment seems totally unearned. Thirdly, no one ever calls Ifemelu on anything and she is never placed in the position of being wrong or being denied anything she wants. I have no doubt the author intended me to find Ifemelu 100% in the right in every situation which is frustrating and dull storytelling. Ironically by trying to create a flawless character Adichie created a badly flawed and poorly designed one. 
 It was depressing that a book with such a strong beginning and such flashes of promise ended up just spinning its wheels and growing increasingly stale as it proceeded. There are some stretches are sharp, clever observational writing here but it is drowning in filler.",Tue Nov 05 11:27:00 -0800 2013,Fri Feb 07 11:54:49 -0800 2014,Mon Feb 03 00:00:00 -0800 2014,Sun Feb 02 00:00:00 -0800 2014,6,1

Eva, who tells the story of her fractured family and homicidal son in a series of letters addressed to her husband, is a fantastically well realized narrator. She is an authentic, full bodied character who has a great mix of flaws and sympathetic attributes. I was totally entranced by her way of dissecting the world, her children, her marriage, and her life through her veil of understandable pain and misanthropy. The writing here is very bracing and acerbic which is a good fit for the subject matter. Stylistically this novel was great; the best prose I've seen from Shriver (this is the 4th book of hers I've read).

However, despite the title of the book, Catherine the Great is not as well developed a character as I would have liked. Most of the book covers the reign of her predecessor Empress Elizabeth, who is actually rendered more interestingly. Because this story is told from Varvara's first person perspective we are only privy to the knowledge she has, which inhibits some of the other characterizations. There also wasn't as much tension or danger in the narrative as I expected given the protagonist is a long term spy with plenty of enemies and competitors at court.

I don't believe in any kind of afterlife, so I obviously don't believe near death experiences have any supernatural component to them whatsoever, yet I am intrigued by them and by how people confront their mortality. This was a thought provoking and at times emotionally powerful book. The ""mystery"" of the near death experiences is gripping and Willis did a good job integrating scientific and historical information into the narrative. I was quite impressed with the plot arc. Willis did a great job simulating the frenetic energy generated by people on an intellectual quest. 
 This book could have definitely used some editing as it continually re-states incredibly minor plot points and the (view spoiler)[ post Joanna's death investigation (hide spoiler)] should have been tightened up but with the exception of these pacing quirks Passage reads pretty easily for such a long work.

I cannot keep my stupid comments in my pocket anymore. I have to review this masterwork. I had ridiculously high expectations for this book and I am happy to say it totally delivered. I don't know if I have ever laughed out loud so hard when reading a book in my life. This is so consistently funny I had tears in my eyes from laughing. 
 You will get lots of great behind the scenes info about this trainwreck production. There are also some poignant and insightful moments as Sestero unpacks his bizarre relationship with Wiseau. As for the man, the myth, the legend himself, this book provides a lot of info on what makes Wiseau tick without puncturing the air of mystery around him. I was worried Sestero might pull his punches given his ongoing relationship with Wiseau but he does not hold back. 
 While I read this book because of my fascination with the Room and Wiseau, Sestero's discussion of his own fledgling acting career outside of the Room was also surprisingly engaging. I became interested in him as a person as well, not just as a Wiseau information delivery system. 
 If I had one thing to change about this book I only wish it had been longer. It is so interesting you never want it to end.

 Most of the book is narrated from the first person perspective of the pathologically oblivious Lavinia. Because of her youth and general stupidity she is a terrible point of view character. None of the other characters manage to be even two dimensional when viewed through her insipid eyes. Belle's point of view chapters are too short/sporadic to add anything of value to the text. 
 In addition to the uniformly poor characterizations this book also featured a hackneyed and predictable plot where pivotal moments are brushed over. Almost every major plot development felt totally unrealistic.

 To start with the good: Having death narrate the story and periodically interject information was a device that bothered me initially but really paid off as the novel progressed. Death's narrative voice was compellingly rendered and really grabbed me. This was a great way to frame the story of Liesel. There is also some great imagery here and some of the supporting characters are well drawn and interesting (Liesel herself remains a bit of a cipher however). 
 Now the bad: Zusak has a very unusual way of crafting prose. When it works, it works very well. However, I found often times his writing style came off as maladroit. By this I mean word choice and sentence structure in this book often read like something that has been badly translated from one language into another (As I started reading I googled the author, sure that either English was not his first language or that this had been inexpertly translated from another language into English. Neither of these things are the case). 
 Some examples of what I mean by weird word choices: descriptive phrases used in this book include ""dark chocolate skies"" and ""breakfast colored suns,"" people cry ""yellow tears"" and have ""lemon colored"" or ""elastic"" hair and ""cardboard"" faces. People ""olden"" or suffer from ""oldening"" and ""abusages"" rather than abuse. Even when descriptive language is not problematic, it is employed over and over again with no variation. For example, the mayor's wife is characterized as having fluffy hair. Almost every time we see her some comment is made about her fluffy hair. At some point we should either stop hearing about her hair or, if it merits so much attention, let's vary the word choice a bit and employ a word besides fluffy. 
 For a book that is all about the power of words, an irritating prose style is particularly problematic. I was often pulled out of the narrative by the author's weird and kind of ugly writing style. It was a persistent problem from beginning to end. 
 This book is still worth reading, but you might do some eye rolling at the stylistic choices made here as I did. As I previously mentioned, Liesel herself is also kind of a bland protagonist.",Wed Sep 25 18:01:44 -0700 2013,Tue Nov 26 08:23:36 -0800 2013,Tue Nov 12 00:00:00 -0800 2013,Wed Nov 06 00:00:00 -0800 2013,0,0

In fairness to the Goldfinch I liked probably the first 40% of the book: the beginning of the book leading up to and including the terrorist attack and aftermath was well written, and I was intrigued by Theo and Boris's relationship in Las Vegas (though even this runs long and Boris is a pretty fantastical character). I was even initially interested in Theo's return to New York and furniture store apprenticeship. 
 Despite these strengths this book only gets one star from me because its obscene bloat slowly but surely killed any interest in or enjoyment of the story. I regret picking this up. It is not worth slogging through the hundreds of pages of tedium and ridiculousness and self indulgence. I would have been much better off just abandoning the book at the halfway point. 
 A good editor could have excavated a good 350 page novel out of this material. I have no problem with long books per se. Some stories are complex enough to require 700, 800 or even more pages to tell them well. This is a very simple story that has been padded out to the point where it becomes unbearable. 
 Also the later plot elements are just really stupid. Really, really, really stupid. 
 I am not one of those people who feels the need to finish every book I start. I have no problem abandoning a book that isn't working for me. However, for a variety of reasons sometimes I do push on even when I don't like a book. I made the mistake of slogging through this book and so now I lament the time I wasted reading this. I can't even appreciate what this book did right because I am so frustrated with how little this book ultimately had to offer, so frustrated with Tartt for inflicting hundreds of pages of aimless word vomit on me and frustrated with myself for ignoring earlier impulses to quit the book.

 Most of this book is crushingly tedious. Page after page of drab nothing. You will know what these characters eat and where they shop and what TV shows they watch and what they wear and when they sleep. Most of the narrative reads like an exceptionally dull Facebook newsfeed. There are authors who can make magic out of the humdrum daily rhythms of suburbia: Tom Perrotta, Jonathan Tropper, Meg Woltizer. Sittenfeld is not one if them. 
 The psychic powers that supposedly drive the plot and profoundly shape twin sisters Daisy/Kate and Vi are laughably underdeveloped. Apparently in this universe being psychic means you have some vague hunches that are right sometimes ( seriously I and everyone I know am psychic by this novel's criteria). Nothing remotely interesting is done with these supposed psychic gifts. 
 There were so many cool things this book could have done with the concept of psychic twins from a cold, dysfunctional family; one who is driven to abandon their gift and one who cultivates it. I think that's why, no matter how I much I hated this I kept reading. I couldn't believe how horrendously the cool concept was being squandered. Part of me kept thinking, maybe the next chapter will finally do something. 
 The plot counts down to an earthquake Vi predicts will occur, to the skepticism of the scientific community. When the fateful day of the proposed quake arrives the book ceases to be merely dull and instead becomes aggravating and totally implausible. The last fifty pages seem like they come from a completely different, yet equally lame manuscript. 
 Spare yourself the trouble of reading this I implore you. There is nothing here to stimulate your intellect or emotions.

I found that volume consistently incomprehensible and populated by bland, poorly developed characters. I am happy to say that this book made great strides in overcoming these problems. While I am not going to say I was never confused reading this book generally speaking it was a lot easier to follow what was going on and why. That doesn't mean this book is simplistic because it is certainly not. As dense and complex as its plots were, I could really engage with this text in a way I rarely could with the first. 
 Also, this book introduced some vivid and compelling characters. The Bridgeburners still come off as ciphers to me (a few of them carry over from book one) but I was really captivated and at times moved by many of the new characters. Since these new characters actually had distinctive voices and personalities I was better able to follow the byzantine mechanics of the plot. 
 Erikson's prose was really working for me this time out as well. His descriptions are very vivid and cinematic and I really liked how he used more (though admittedly still not a lot of) internal monologue this time out. 
 There are a few plot twists feel that feel contrived, probably because Erikson never tells you the rules of the game so to speak, and this book definitely overuses the warrens, but I am now a lot more intrigued than annoyed by Erikson's world.",Tue Aug 20 07:58:11 -0700 2013,Sat Jan 10 11:12:26 -0800 2015,Thu Aug 29 00:00:00 -0700 2013,Tue Aug 20 00:00:00 -0700 2013,0,0

The writer creates atmosphere well and there is some interesting commentary on class, Southern mores and familial dysfunction. However I think the plot and characterization were hampered by the way the story was told. Thea, the shamed 15 year old protagonist, narrates the story in first person as an adult. The first person narration means that readers don't get any insights into how other characters think and feel and the fact that Thea is so many years removed from the events of the story means that we don't get the emotional intensity and immediacy first person narration is supposed to provide. 
 I thought the best parts of the story were the flashbacks, leading up to the scandal that led to Thea's banishment from the home, and Thea's reflections on her feelings. Thea's complicated relationship with her sexual awakening is probably the most fully developed and interesting part of the book. I thought the author did a good job showcasing the contradictory combination of insecurity and arrogance that teenagers often possess. 
 The ending is rushed and anti-climactic. 
 There's not too much horse stuff. I could not care less about horses and I was never bothered by the information the author included about riding.",Wed Aug 14 14:55:08 -0700 2013,Wed Apr 30 09:15:18 -0700 2014,Wed Apr 30 09:15:18 -0700 2014,Thu Apr 24 00:00:00 -0700 2014,0,0

This book does a lot of world building in a gripping, entertaining fashion. There is a lot of satisfying plot progression here. The more I learn about the world of the Dark Tower (and how it connects to our own) the more I want to. We get some much needed and satisfying back story here, as well as a lot of cool twists and turns and turns along the road to the Tower. I really like how King balances the futuristic and the primitive aspects of his universe. 
 Roland remains to me the least interesting member of the Ka-tet but he has grown on me to the point where I can at least find him mildly entertaining and he's no longer a hindrance to my enjoyment of the series. I don't buy the Eddie/Susannah romance (as much as I like both characters individually) but this doesn't detract greatly from how entertaining this book was either. What shines about this book is how vivid the world these characters inhabit has become.

This book chronicles four relationships at different stages of their development (from a quick affair to a forty year marriage), and through at least some of them hits on some pretty interesting points about how couples manage the joys and stresses of married life. These relationship narratives are framed by the sorry of Frances Gerety, the advertiser who coined the slogan ""Diamonds are Forever"". Here is how I would rank the sections in terms of quality, from best to worst: Evelyn/1972, James/1987, Frances 1947-88, Kate/2012, Delphine/2003. The best plot lines are really well developed, but the two weakest plots are tedious (Kate) and eye gougingly annoying (Delphine).",Thu Aug 08 01:41:00 -0700 2013,Tue Aug 13 08:34:00 -0700 2013,Tue Aug 13 08:34:00 -0700 2013,Thu Aug 08 00:00:00 -0700 2013,0,0

It is great fun to hang out in this world and soak up the ambience and all the details surrounding the cult of reclusive director Stanislav Cordova. His daughter's death is investigated by disgraced journalist Scott McGrath, aspiring actress and coat check girl Nora Halliday and lovelorn drug dealer Hopper. There was obviously a lot of care and creativity put into constructing this story. Everything simultaneously feels authentic and other worldly. The alternative film history is awesome and the tone of the book is appropriately very film noir. 
 The stylistic gimmick of including documents in text, such as magazine and blog posts, photos etc really comes off as well. These really enrich the text.

 This book is ridiculously witty and clever, with prose and dialogue that is regularly laugh out funny and deeply insightful. When I started the book it almost seemed too clever to me, the level of verbal gymnastics seemed a bit forced, but ultimately the beauty of the language and the richness of the story makes these hyper literate, hyper articulate characters work. They still feel real and authentic. I was awed by how this book contained some very powerful, beautiful and resonant observations about life and mortality yet it also smartly punctured a lot of the false, feel good myths we tell ourselves to try to handle the horror and senselessness of death. 
 Given the subject matter it is not surprising that this book is also a tear jerker but the sentiment is earned. I teared up at at least half a dozen parts of this book and fully cried at the end. 
 I highly recommend this book because it deftly balanced comedic and dramatic elements and created vivid, engaging and loveable but not cloying characters.

However I must confess the second half of the book won me over with its charm and sweetness, despite the narrative problems. This books grows on you, and Eva and Daniel have a blessedly warm, non-annoying romance. It is sort of thin and shallow but also genuinely heartwarming so I give it three stars for the emotional engagement I felt with the second half of the narrative and for the beautiful descriptions of Cornwall.",Fri Jul 26 17:13:00 -0700 2013,Mon Jul 29 13:03:03 -0700 2013,Mon Jul 29 13:03:03 -0700 2013,Fri Jul 26 00:00:00 -0700 2013,0,0
